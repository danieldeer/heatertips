      <description>&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the average Dyson Hot and Cool heater fan running cost? And how energy-efficient are Dyson heaters when compared to regular space heaters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyson heaters are up to 30% more energy efficient than regular space heaters. At least that‚Äôs what Dyson claims. Today, I‚Äôm going to check whether Dyson heaters are as energy-efficient as they promise to be and whether getting one is worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm an electrical engineer and together with you, I want to cut through the jungle of myths and claims. In this article, you‚Äôll learn everything about how efficient Dyson heaters really are and whether Dyson is overselling their product, or whether it‚Äôs worth buying (I surprised myself with my findings).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can I use an Extension Cord with a Space Heater?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôre going to cover exactly whether you can use an extension cord with your space heater and what you have to be cautious of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question: Can I use an extension cord with a space heater?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: &lt;strong&gt;You should avoid using an extension cord with your space heater. But if you have to, use a heavy-duty extension cord. Also, if possible, operate your space heater at a low to moderate heat setting in order.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can use a diesel heater indoors, in your house, in a garage, shed, or workshop. All you need is a reliable, weatherproof diesel heater setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diesel heaters can make great emergency heaters. With just a car battery and some diesel, you can heat your home in case of an electricity outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, for tiny houses or cabins, diesel heaters can even be reliable long-term heaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we‚Äôre having a look at how to properly set up a diesel heater for indoor heating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Space Heaters Over 1,500 Watts (Electric, Gas)</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/space-heaters-over-1500-watts/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 09:25:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/space-heaters-over-1500-watts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Space heaters are usually limited to 1,500 Watts. Especially in the US. That‚Äôs because US home circuits are laid out to supply 120 Volts. Combined with a 15 Ampere fuse, that corresponds to a maximum power consumption of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;120 Volts √ó 15 Amps = 1,800 Watts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the average US household circuit can support 1,800 Watts. But since you want to run multiple devices simultaneously, and not just a single heater, space heaters cap at 1,500 Watts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am Daniel, an electrical engineer. For heatertips.com I research cost-effective heating and air conditioning methods, debunk myths, and explain what really works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging about home heating and air conditioning on this website since 2019 now. There have been many emotional ups and downs. Sustaining a website in the age of AI is certainly a challenge. But since writing became a daily habit for me, I view heatertips as a passion project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How many Amps does a Diesel Heater use?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/how-many-amps-does-a-diesel-heater-use/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 15:10:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-many-amps-does-a-diesel-heater-use/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did an experiment, measuring the amperage of my diesel heater. This post is about the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look for diesel heater amperages online, you don‚Äôt get any good answers. One website I found said that ‚Äúdiesel heater draws 1 amp per hour‚Äù. As an electrical engineer, hearing this hurts my brain. Severely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs as if I say that my car uses 100 horsepower per hour. It‚Äôs just a nonsensical use of the unit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>4 Best Fanless Heaters</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/best-fanless-heaters/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 09:48:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/best-fanless-heaters/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fanless heaters have several advantages when compared to regular electric space heaters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No wear-down:&lt;/strong&gt; Since they have no built-in fan, they don‚Äôt wear down over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No maintenance:&lt;/strong&gt; Since they contain no moving parts, they are maintenance-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No cleaning:&lt;/strong&gt; Since there‚Äôs no constant stream of air passing through the heater, it does not accumulate dust, and, therefore, does not need cleaning or built-in air filters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silence:&lt;/strong&gt; Fanless heaters are 100% silent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these findings, we can already tell that maintenance-wise and technology-wise, fanless heaters are superior to most other electric space heaters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diesel vs Electric RV Heaters: Which to Pick?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/diesel-vs-electric-rv-heaters/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re getting your RV ready for trips, picking the right heater is a big deal. It&amp;rsquo;s all about staying warm and cozy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of van travelers wonder whether to go with a diesel heater or an electric one. Diesel heaters are great for pumping out a lot of heat, but setting them up and keeping them running takes some work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric heaters are easier to use and quieter, but they might not give you as much warmth and need a steady electric supply. Which one is better really depends on where and how you plan to use your van.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it‚Äôs getting cold, the diesel in diesel heaters tends to gel up, which, in turn prevents your diesel heater from working properly. Ideally, the diesel in your heater should always be a liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôll have a look at 4 simple ways to prevent diesel gelling in your diesel heater when it‚Äôs cold.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diesel Heater E10 Error Code (3 Causes and Fixes)</title>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/fix-diesel-heater-e10-error/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Diesel heaters are quite complex. Faults can be anywhere in the fuel pump, the blower, the glow plug, or the electric supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when your diesel heater shows an E10 error code without any context, you usually have no idea where to start looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article serves as a reference for the E10 error on diesel heaters. We‚Äôll have a look at what the E10 code means, different reasons for the issue, and how to fix all of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diesel Heater Not Getting Hot (12 Fixes)</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/diesel-heater-not-getting-hot/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 09:58:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/diesel-heater-not-getting-hot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The single major disadvantage of diesel heaters is, in my opinion, that they contain too many different parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your diesel heater is not getting hot / not blowing hot air, the issue can be practically anywhere. It can be the fuel pump, electronic controls, the car battery, the atomizer, the combustion chamber, anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes them relatively hard to troubleshoot. However, it‚Äôs not as hard as you think. When diesel heaters stop working, it‚Äôs usually just a bunch of common problems you need to check.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have a look at the vast amount of different diesel and propane heaters you can buy. It‚Äôs insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you‚Äôre someone who has never used either of them, you‚Äôre probably wondering what‚Äôs even different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as their names suggest, diesel heaters use diesel, and propane heaters use propane. That‚Äôs obvious. But the technical implications following the fuel choice are significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôre going to have a look at the differences between diesel and propane heaters and which of both, in my opinion, is the better heater.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>4 Best Child-Safe Heaters</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/best-child-safe-heaters/</link>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/best-child-safe-heaters/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some space heaters are made specifically for families with children. However, most of these ‚Äúchild-safe space heaters‚Äù are actually regular space heaters that are designed to &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; child-safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But inherently, there‚Äôs nothing that makes them safer than space heaters for adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really dislike the marketing scheme here. Just designing a dangerous device to &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; safe doesn‚Äôt make it safe. Especially not for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôll have a look at space heaters that are very safe for children, regardless of whether they are designed to look like baby / child products, or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Encountering the F4 error on your Dyson appliance can be a cause for concern, but it‚Äôs often a problem you can solve yourself. This guide will provide you with a clear understanding of what the F4 error means for different Dyson models and the steps you can take to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;If your Dyson shows an F4 error, first try power cycling and checking for any obvious blockages or misalignments.&lt;/strong&gt; If the problem continues, it could indicate a motor or sensor issue, in which case you should contact Dyson support, especially if your device is still under the 2-year warranty. If not, consider replacing it with a newer model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/space-heater-or-hot-water-bottle-9-differences/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been writing articles for this website for over 4 years now, spending hours and hours explaining space heaters and how to use them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the while resting both feet against a hot water bottle lying on the floor, under my desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one thought just popped up in my mind: Am I a hypocrite?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve spent so much time &amp;amp; effort writing about heaters and telling people which products to buy. All this, of course, earns me some money as well, when people buy from my recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;One thing I learned is: You can make any night comfortable &amp;amp; warm with the right preparation, even without much special gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or ‚Ä¶ to be honest ‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; any night. Some nights are just doomed to be freezing cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for those freezing cold nights, all you think about is ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt I bring a heater?‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-to-heat-a-van-in-winter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all. First off, I want to say, I am absolutely no van expert since I don‚Äôt possess one myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I spent several nights in &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cold environments, sleeping in an unheated car, sleeping outside on a freezing parking lot in mid-winter in the alps, and I even spent nights off-grid above 15,000 feet in the Himalayas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, even though I don‚Äôt drive a van around myself, I experienced quite a few nights in the freezing cold. And since I‚Äôve been writing about heaters on this website for over 4 years now, it‚Äôs time to devote an article to the van community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A freezing cold wood workshop is uncomfortable to work in. But what‚Äôs the best heater for wood workshops?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood workshops are quite special places not all heaters are suited for. Frequently, the air is dusty (from sawing and sanding), there‚Äôs a lot of flammable wood around, and oftentimes, wood workshops are not insulated too well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, an ideal wood workshop heater can handle dust exposure, is fire-safe, and outputs enough heat to keep your workshop at whatever temperature you desire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your heat storm heater is not working? It doesn‚Äôt turn on? Or it turns on, but the fan doesn‚Äôt blow? Or it turns on, but shuts off on its own after some time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, heat storm heaters are comparably simple devices. They don‚Äôt have that many components that can break.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/fix-dyson-wrong-air-quality-temperature/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your Dyson fan suddenly shows wrong air quality reports and / or a wrong temperature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, the air quality report shows a 999 value and the temperature shows 0¬∞C (or ¬∞K).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the air quality report and temperature are stuck at a certain value, or they don‚Äôt show values at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This usually indicates a problem with the air quality and temperature sensor. Usually, the problem is easy to fix and requires just a few minutes of your time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When your Dyson fan shows a warning triangle with an exclamation mark, something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the warning triangle, your Dyson fan does not give you any further information about the issue, and no instructions on what to do now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôll have a quick look at the warning triangle error, what causes it, and what you should do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dyson F2 Error Code: How to Fix It</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/fix-dyson-f2-error-code/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 08:09:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/fix-dyson-f2-error-code/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The F2 error code on Dyson fans is simple to fix once you know what causes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Dyson doesn‚Äôt seem to know what causes the error. I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the reason for your Dyson fan showing the F2 error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptom:&lt;/strong&gt; Dyson fan senses a power drop, displays F2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cause:&lt;/strong&gt; Friction in the fan motor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; Disassemble and clean the fan, ensure the fan motor is snapped into position, tighten any screws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F2 error is comparably rare because it is related to internal friction inside the device. This usually happens when a Dyson fan is not carefully assembled.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-to-reset-the-f-code-on-a-dyson-air-purifier/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every few months, your Dyson air purifier will show an F code with three blinking lights next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‚ÄúF‚Äù code stands for ‚ÄúFilter‚Äù and signals you to replace your air purifier‚Äôs filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyson recommends to do this every 6-12 months. Based on the time passed since you last replaced the filter (or since you bought the air purifier), and the filter‚Äôs airflow resistance, Dyson can determine when a filter replacement is due.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;E1, standing for &amp;ldquo;Error 1&amp;rdquo;, often indicates an issue with the thermal cutoff switch or the thermostat in many electric heaters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is it time to replace my air conditioner?&amp;rdquo; This is a question that plagues many homeowners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air conditioners, unlike some other household items, don&amp;rsquo;t just stop working overnight. Instead, they degrade slowly, leaving you in a grey area about when exactly to invest in a new unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the decision-making, rules like &amp;lsquo;replace it after 10 years&amp;rsquo; exist. But are they genuine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that most rules on the internet are constructed by the HVAC industry to sell you a new air conditioner way too early.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your electric fireplace is not working? In this article, we‚Äôll try to get your heater working again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I‚Äôve been writing several in-depth articles on &lt;a href=&#34;https://heatertips.com/space-heater-not-blowing-hot-air/&#34;&gt;heater repairs&lt;/a&gt;. And the issues in electric heaters are always the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, it‚Äôs either a power supply issue, a thermostat issue, or a blown part in the electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric fireplaces are a bit special. They are a lot bulkier than regular heaters. And they come with some additional features, such as the moving lights, which also can stop working.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are electric fireplaces energy efficient? The first statement I see when I google for electric fireplace efficiency is that electric fireplaces have 100% efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds quite good, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These statements about efficiencies are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; misleading unless you know the physics of electric fireplaces precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I am going to show you why the 100% efficiency of electric fireplaces is &lt;em&gt;meaningless&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after tearing these marketing statements down, we‚Äôll find out how truly efficient they are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Just for fun and giggles, I googled ‚ÄúDo infrared heaters heat the air?‚Äù and the (current) number one result says that ‚Äúinfrared heaters don‚Äôt add [heat] to the air‚Äù&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Blueair Blue 211+ is the largest air purifier in Blueair‚Äôs Blue series. But does its size benefit you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or are smaller models such as the 311 or 411 just as good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, how does the Blueair Blue keep up with its competition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blueair fiercely competes with Levoit and Coway, two of the most popular air purifier brands.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yay! I discovered a new product: The Bluegrass Living propane heater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know where this model has been all the time, but the Bluegrass Living propane heater looks neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending dozens of hours reviewing both ventless portable heaters and vented propane heaters, my results were clear: &lt;a href=&#34;https://heatertips.com/are-mr-heater-buddy-heaters-any-good/&#34;&gt;Mr Heater Buddy heaters&lt;/a&gt; are next to unbeatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But possibly, &lt;strong&gt;Bluegrass Living models can compete&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let‚Äôs do a fully unbiased review.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3 Most Powerful Space Heaters</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/most-powerful-space-heaters/</link>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/most-powerful-space-heaters/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we‚Äôre going to have a look at the most powerful space heaters. &lt;em&gt;In depth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre going to check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which space heaters provide the most heat? (checking heaters with and without installation separately)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much electric power do they consume?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What‚Äôs the proper way to install and use them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And to round it all up: How to generate the most heat using only space heaters, but &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; installation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, a disclaimer: Since we‚Äôre really trying to find the absolute strongest space heaters on the market, most of the recommended products on this page are way too strong for regular living spaces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do Air Purifiers Need Water?</title>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/do-air-purifiers-need-water/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do air purifiers need water? And do you have to replace water regularly? Do you need to put in any maintenance work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quick post is going to answer all of that. Luckily, it‚Äôs very simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;No, most air purifiers never need water. Air purifiers pass air through a dry HEPA filter, which needs replacement every 6-12 months. Air purifiers with built-in humidifiers, however, need water replacements occasionally. But in this case, the water is not needed for air purification.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Nuwave OxyPure is one of the best-selling large air purifiers online. It‚Äôs time I put my hands on it and review it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look for an in-depth Nuwave OxyPure review, I am surprised there is so little actual insight available. I mean there is plenty of information. But everybody just tries to sell you this air purifier, without consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let me tell you: The Nuwave OxyPure is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the best choice for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dyson Big&#43;Quiet Review: High Price, High Performance?</title>

      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2023 08:12:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/dyson-big-quiet-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dyson recently launched the Big+Quiet air purifier. I found out yesterday, after writing about &lt;a href=&#34;https://heatertips.com/are-dyson-air-purifiers-worth-the-money/&#34;&gt;whether Dyson air purifiers are worth the money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, as an HVAC blogger and electrical engineer, I get to know all new products on the market quickly. But the Big+Quiet entered the stage, as its name suggests, quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the biggest reason is the price. &lt;strong&gt;At $1,000, the Dyson Big+Quiet is a luxury product.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you google the &amp;ldquo;Dyson Big+Quiet&amp;rdquo;, all you get is a wall of sales copy-type blog posts with no investigation beyond surface-level data and no questioning of marketing statements at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are Dyson air purifiers worth the money? Recently, Dyson launched its new product line, the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet, which costs just around $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs a huge price for an air purifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what‚Äôs so special about this thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that Dyson has been selling air purifiers for ages, as features built into the Pure Cool and Hot+Cool models, are Dyson air purifiers worth the money?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are Vornado fans worth it? In this article, we‚Äôre going to check how well Vornado fans &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; perform and whether they are worth the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am Daniel! I am an electrical engineer and I investigate electric devices &lt;em&gt;in-depth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt care about the Vornado brand and I am not affiliated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, everything you read in this review is 100% independent information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, Vornado fans are worth it. They blow a focused stream of air, optimized for cooling people. Their build quality is superior to most other fans. A Vornado fan can easily last you 10-20 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are any Space Heaters made in the USA?</title>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/are-any-space-heaters-made-in-the-usa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been looking for a space heater made in the USA for ages. I decided to put an end to it. In this article, we‚Äôre going to find out which space heaters are engineered, designed, or manufactured in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the rabbit hole is deep. While many space heater companies started manufacturing in the US, their manufacturing plants often left the country due to globalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;There are no space heaters that are 100% made in the USA, but some are engineered, designed, or assembled in the country. Brands like Vornado, Mr. Heater, and Lasko are American. My favorite American space heater is the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QZ11J6?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;amp;linkId=2123c0365f4cf1e6fc5710d8c9eb79ae&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Infrared DR-968&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heating in the office can be unnecessarily complex, especially when using space heaters. Most workplaces either prohibit or limit the use of space heaters. And if space heaters are allowed, they have to fit certain size criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these rules can get very annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;rsquo;s practically impossible to heat an office to a temperature that suits everybody, space heaters can be a practical solution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heating a room with high ceilings with only space heaters can be challenging. Not only does a lot of heat rise to the ceiling and is effectively wasted, but additionally, most space heaters are not very strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôre going to explore how to properly heat rooms with high ceilings with just space heaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two fundamental approaches: Either get a very strong heater or get a heater that effectively distributes heat into your room and away from the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do Space Heaters Burn Oxygen?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/do-space-heaters-burn-oxygen/</link>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/do-space-heaters-burn-oxygen/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do space heaters burn oxygen? The cold season is approaching and there are plenty of space heater myths and misconceptions that make you stop and hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If space heaters really burn oxygen, maybe you should find another way to heat. Should you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs stop the speculation and get right to the core of the matter. Here‚Äôs the answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electric space heaters never burn oxygen, since the source of the heat is not a chemical reaction. Only fuel-burning heaters such as propane heaters or kerosene heaters do burn oxygen. However, due to tiny oxygen inflow streams from outdoors through gaps and creeks, and the built-in oxygen depletion sensor many fuel-burning heaters are absolutely safe to use indoors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How long does a 420lb Propane Tank last?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/how-long-does-a-420lb-propane-tank-last/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 12:33:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-long-does-a-420lb-propane-tank-last/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The longevity of a 420lb propane tank varies significantly based on the heater you&amp;rsquo;re using it with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a smaller heating system, it might last you almost an entire season, but if you‚Äôre powering a strong industrial-scale heater, a 420lb propane tank can run out of gas in just a matter of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;A 420lb propane tank can last from roughly 60 hours up to an impressive 2,419 hours, depending on the heater&amp;rsquo;s BTU rating. With a standard household 9,000 BTU heater, it lasts for 805 hours (33 days) of uninterrupted heating. On the other hand, with an industrial-grade torpedo heater (120,000 BTU), it would last just about 60 hours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can you use an Extension Cord with an Air Purifier?</title>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/can-you-use-an-extension-cord-with-an-air-purifier/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you use an extension cord for an air purifier? In this article, we‚Äôre going to explore the art of using extension cords with air purifiers and how to stay safe at all times!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extension cords can pose a risk when not used appropriately. While air purifiers generally consume much less power than similar devices (such as portable air conditioners), safety precautions are still essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most extension cords can handle the little power an air purifier draws. But a very bad quality extension cord that can&amp;rsquo;t handle the required power can pose a risk of melting or even catching fire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why does my air purifier smell musty, like plastic, sweet, or even like a wet dog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems like a bad plot in a poor comic. I bought an air purifier to get the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; opposite result!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just don‚Äôt buy an air purifier to make things smell &lt;em&gt;worse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like you don‚Äôt eat food to get more hungry. And you don‚Äôt buy a car to drive you farther away from your destination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Having clean and fresh air is important for your well-being. And air purifiers are supposed to remove odors. Or are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;( There will be a surprising answer to this question - not all air purifiers can remove odors )&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your air purifier is not collecting dust, even though you already run it for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://heatertips.com/can-you-run-air-purifier-all-day/&#34;&gt;long time&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôre going to check all the possible causes of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And before we take the deep dive: Not all air purifiers have to collect dust. Dust is, in the end, just the particles that are visible to the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air purifiers filter much smaller particles than that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, after some time, you should see &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; on the filters. If that‚Äôs not the case, today is the day this is going to change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you run an air purifier and a humidifier at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a quick Google search. Here are the first results that pop up (in a nutshell).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google search results for the query ‚ÄúCan you run an air purifier and a humidifier at the same time?‚Äù:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes (no explanation given &lt;em&gt;at all)&lt;/em&gt;( &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.filtrete.com/3M/en_US/filtrete/home-tips/full-story/~/running-an-air-purifier-and-humidifier-at-the-same-time/?storyid=59002fd2-fe9f-48a2-8c65-5be479d49355&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you run an air purifier with a window open? In this article, we‚Äôre going to check whether it makes sense to vent your room while you run your air purifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the answer is quite obvious: of course, you can run your air purifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as soon as you open your window, particles like pollen and bacteria enter your room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that a reason to stop your air purifier? Should you wait until the window is closed to run it again?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you run an air purifier 24/7 (all day, every day)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is all about this question. But we don‚Äôt stop there. After reading this, you‚Äôll not only know exactly &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you can run your air purifier all day, but also whether it even &lt;em&gt;makes sense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is not just to tell you what to do. A lot of search results are totally useless. For example, when I search for ‚ÄúCan you run an air purifier all day?‚Äù, the first result tells me ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, but does not explain &lt;em&gt;why.&lt;/em&gt; (I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a why!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How much does an Air Purifier cost to run? I love my air purifier and I&amp;rsquo;d really like to run it 24/7. But how much would that cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, I am going to answer how much running an air purifier for different durations costs (8 hours, 24 hours, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the article, you&amp;rsquo;ll know exactly, &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; your air purifier costs to run, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it costs so much (or so little), and how you can &lt;em&gt;reduce the power consumption even further&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to stick to products that simply work. Personally, I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; marketing tricks and lies. And if you read my other articles on this website, I always prefer simplicity and sturdiness over shiny objects that can‚Äôt hold their promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this time, let‚Äôs have a look at my favorite air purifier and why I decided to get this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;The best air purifier is the Levoit Core 300. It is simple, collects a lot of dust and is easy to maintain. After using it for a month and seeing the thickness of dust it collects, it is evident why this air purifier is so popular.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve seen me talk a lot about the Hessaire MC37M. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s on the list of top swamp coolers for garages or in our swamp cooler vs air conditioner comparison, the MC37M stands out. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;The best swamp cooler is the Hessaire MC37M. It is robust, has more than enough power to cool even large spaces, and lasts a lifetime. For smaller rooms, you can get the MC18M model.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do Swamp Coolers need open windows?</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 09:32:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/do-swamp-coolers-need-open-windows/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered if you need to leave your windows open for your swamp cooler to work effectively? The answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;No, swamp coolers do not need open windows to operate effectively. For optimal performance and energy efficiency, it&amp;rsquo;s better to keep windows closed and control the indoor humidity through regular venting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, your cooler performs best with your windows closed and occasional venting. This contrasts with several misconceptions about swamp coolers: that the increased humidity must be constantly vented out, that longer running times lead to higher humidity, and that open windows help airflow. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll bust these myths and give you a clear guide to using your swamp cooler more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Does putting ice in a Swamp Cooler make sense?</title>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/does-ice-in-a-swamp-cooler-make-sense/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does putting ice in a swamp cooler make sense? Hardly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It definitely skyrockets your swamp cooler running costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Putting ice in a swamp cooler doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. The addition of ice doesn&amp;rsquo;t significantly enhance cooling, it increases energy consumption and cost, and ice melts rapidly in the cooler&amp;rsquo;s environment. Moreover, the design of many swamp coolers prevents the inclusion of ice in the tank.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-a-swamp-cooler-work-does-it-need-ice&#34;&gt;How does a swamp cooler work? Does it need ice?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A swamp cooler cools down air by evaporating water. Water evaporation sucks heat energy away from the air.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you need to refill a swamp cooler or can you run it without water? In this article, we‚Äôre checking how a swamp cooler uses water to cool and what happens once it runs dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief you can run a swamp cooler without water! And in extreme situations, you can even refill a swamp cooler without access to water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs find out how!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, you can run a swamp cooler without water. Once the water runs out, it becomes a simple fan. So, you still have a (reduced) cooling effect. In an emergency, where you don‚Äôt have access to water, you can collect morning dew by placing the water pads outdoors overnight. The humidity is enough to cool you in the afternoon heat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;After reading through all the sections, you will know whether a swamp cooler or an air conditioner suits you better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Swamp coolers are way cheaper to run and do not require any installation. Air conditioners, however, work anywhere and anytime. Swamp coolers work best in dry and hot climates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to fix swamp cooler smell. Swamp coolers are the ultimate breeding ground for bacteria and bad odors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the dust that comes in from the outside collects on the air filters and the wet water pads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days in the summer heat, the smell is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swamp coolers stink naturally. Especially, when they‚Äôre used a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether a swamp cooler works depends on the climate in your area. In this article, we‚Äôre having a quick glance at all US states and whether swamp coolers work there or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Swamp coolers work in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;every US state during the afternoon, because that is the driest time of the day. Using a swamp cooler all day and throughout the year only makes sense in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you run a swamp cooler all day? How humid will your living space be? And is there a risk of the electronics blowing up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, you can run a swamp cooler all day. Swamp coolers do not add humidity to your room indefinitely, because they run at room temperature (and don‚Äôt boil the water like a kettle). Also, they run on very little electric power, so they don‚Äôt overheat. To maximize running time, lubricate the fan every year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can a swamp cooler catch on fire? What happens when they run out of water?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;A swamp cooler will not catch fire, even when the water runs out. Swamp coolers run on low wattages, which makes overheating highly unlikely. Swap coolers are the safest cooling devices (together with fans).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Garages get very hot in the summer. Let‚Äôs have a look at the best swamp coolers specifically for garages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I looked for garage swamp coolers online, I was actually a bit surprised by the lack of information about garage swamp coolers. I mean, when you look for garage swamp coolers, you want a sturdy, durable, and maintainable device, that will last you for many summers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You usually don‚Äôt care about looks. You don‚Äôt want plastic screws. You want a swamp cooler that can take a hit, and which you can easily move around the garage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-to-fix-a-dyna-glo-heater-not-lighting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Only a few parts can cause a Dyna-Glo heater not lighting. Typically, they are the parts that ignite and measure the pilot light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, a Dyna-Glo heater not lighting is usually easy to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs look at all the possible problems and how you can fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-fix-a-dyna-glo-heater-not-lighting&#34;&gt;How to fix a Dyna-Glo heater not lighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Dyna-Glo heater is not lighting. So, to find out the cause of your issue, we have to trace the path of ignition, starting with the tank, followed by the propane hose, the igniter, the pilot light, and the thermocouple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your Vornado Heater is not working and you don‚Äôt know why? In this article, we‚Äôre going to check everything you can do to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the official Vornado website is not helpful at all. All you get is a ‚Äútroubleshooting‚Äù document that tells you to turn the heater off and on. Not helpful at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tip you get in the document is to not use your heater with a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) safety wall outlet‚Ä¶ which is, in my opinion, pointless advice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best Vented Propane Heater without Electricity</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/best-vented-propane-heater-without-electricity/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 11:00:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/best-vented-propane-heater-without-electricity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a vented propane heater that does not use electricity? Unfortunately, they don‚Äôt exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I am going to explain to you why you can‚Äôt find a vented propane heater that does not use electricity (for off-grid heating) anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, we‚Äôre going to check what you can do about it. Freezing is not an option!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Vented propane heaters always need electricity to power their built-in fan which blows waste gases through the vent. Propane heaters that don‚Äôt require electricity to run are always ventless. The best ventless propane heater without electricity is a Mr. Heater Buddy heater or a wall-mounted Dyna Glo propane heater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How long does a 20lb Propane Tank last?</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2023 11:52:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-long-does-a-20lb-propane-tank-last/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How long a 20lb propane tank lasts depends on the heater you use with it. Depending on how much you use your propane tank, the tank can empty in one day, or in a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôre going to check all the different possible durations. You just have to look up your heater‚Äôs heating power (in BTU per hour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;A 20lb propane tank lasts for 38 hours of heating on a regular 9,000 BTU portable propane heater. On larger heaters (30,000 to 60,000 BTU) it lasts between 6 and 12 hours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a heating blogger and an electrical engineer, the internet never ceases to disappoint me. When I looked for the best vented gas heaters online, I found only bogus results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every article recommended heaters that looked like vented gas heaters but were actually ventless. Heck, even Walmart fails to differentiate between ventless and vented gas heaters when you use their search option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôre going to check out the best &lt;em&gt;&amp;amp; truly vented&lt;/em&gt; gas heaters. Spoiler: There are tons of choices, but only a few are good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best Space Heaters Not Hot to Touch</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/best-space-heaters-not-hot-to-touch/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 11:10:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/best-space-heaters-not-hot-to-touch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What are the best space heaters that are not hot to touch? When you have children or pets around, space heaters that are hot to the touch are not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, you‚Äôre going to learn about space heaters with the lowest possible surface temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;The Dyson Hot + Cool is the best space heater that‚Äôs not hot to the touch. The combination of an embedded heating element and a built-in fan that blows heat out of the heater‚Äôs body prevents surface overheating. A more cost-effective alternative is a DeLonghi oil-filled radiator, which maximizes its surface area using&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;thermal slots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;, and, therefore, minimizes the chance of burning your fingers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your evaporative cooler is not turning on? In this article, you‚Äôre getting a complete list of things you should inspect before you declare your evaporative cooler dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre going to check the most common issues and their fixes. And along the way, you‚Äôre going to learn a bunch about the inner workings of your cooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;An evaporative cooler won‚Äôt turn on if it does not receive electric power. This could be due to a broken wall outlet, power cord, or blown fuse. But broken parts such as blown electronics, water damage, or an empty water tank can also stop your evaporative cooler from turning on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your swamp cooler is not blowing cold air? In this article, I guide you through fixing your swamp cooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, we‚Äôre going to check the different possible reasons why your swamp cooler is not blowing cold air. For each cause, I list a way to test for this cause and one or more methods to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;A swamp cooler is not blowing cold air when the fan does not blow air or when the water pads are not soaked. Possible causes include a broken fan, clogged air filters, a broken water pump, or clogged water lines. Usually, cleaning the clogged parts, replacing air filters, and checking the connection points of the water lines solves the issue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your swamp cooler is making noise? In this article, we‚Äôre going to cover the most common noise types, including humming, screeching, buzzing, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each noise, you‚Äôre going to learn where it comes from and how you can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Swamp coolers often make humming, gurgling and crackling noises. These are expected. You can reduce these normal noises with anti-vibration pads. Screeching, buzzing, scratching and banging noises are signs of unlubricated parts, loose parts, or faulty electronics. You can fix these noises with silicone lubricant, by tightening the parts in place, or by replacing the noisy parts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your window AC is making noise? In this article, we‚Äôll cover all the different noise types in window ACs. For each noise, we check whether it is dangerous, the cause for the noise, and, of course, how to fix it (if necessary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Window AC noises are usually&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not dangerous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;But scratching, whistling or banging noises indicate larger failures in your window AC which you have to address. The most common cause for window AC noises is broken parts in the compressor or fan, such as broken bearings or broken brackets which allow the fan or compressor to jump around in your window AC.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Blue Flame vs Infrared Heater: Which is better?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/blue-flame-vs-infrared-heater/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 12:01:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/blue-flame-vs-infrared-heater/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are blue flame or infrared heaters better? The answer is: Blue flame and infrared heaters are &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; the same. Together, we‚Äôre going to myth bust blue flame and infrared heater differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after reading this article, you know exactly which heater to pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Technically, infrared heaters are better than blue flame heaters since they radiate some of the heat into the room. Blue flame heaters emit hot air which rises upward. So, infrared heaters have a slightly better heat distribution. However, practically, blue flame and infrared heaters both produce radiant and convection heat. So, the main difference is looks. Heating output, gas usage, and efficiency are equal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the safest propane heater? When it comes to propane heater safety, &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; is claiming different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I am going to uncover propane heater safety myths and tell you only the facts that &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; agrees on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an experiment, I bought a propane heater, and actually tried to burn things. And I measured propane heater temperatures using a laser thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the measurements, you can tell what is and what isn‚Äôt a safe propane heater.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are Mr. Heaters safe to use in a tent? Many use Mr. Heater Buddys (and other models) as their primary outdoor heat source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are great in cabins, RVs, and in workshops. But can you use a Mr. Heater in your tent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will check whether Mr. Heaters can ignite or melt tent walls and whether they emit carbon monoxide. And of course, we will check whether it‚Äôs possible to run a Mr. Heater for a full night in a tent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are Mr. Heater Buddy heaters any good? &lt;em&gt;Everybody&lt;/em&gt; recommends Mr. Heaters all the time. So, I bought one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together we will have a look at how good they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to be &lt;em&gt;extra critical&lt;/em&gt; in this article and pay attention to all the fine-grained details that other websites leave out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs uncover the truth about Mr. Heater!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Mr. Heater Buddy heaters are not good for everyone. They get over &amp;gt;1,000¬∞F. Their protection grid can‚Äôt prevent fire. And on a 1-pound propane bottle, a Mr. Heater lasts only for 5.4h on the lowest setting. So, they don‚Äôt last a full night unless you bring a larger propane tank.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;However, these issues are present in all propane heaters with the same heat output.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/space-heater-smoking-fixes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your space heater is smoking? Immediately unplug it from the wall outlet! Then, grab a tea (or whatever you like) and make yourself comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading this article, you will know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what to do about your smoking space heater. We will check whether you should get a new one, and if not, how to fix the most likely causes of your space heater smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Space heaters usually smoke from the heating elements, the internal power electronics, the power cord, or the case. Smoking heating elements usually indicate dust. Clean them with rubbing alcohol. If smoke comes out the inside, then check the electronics for blown parts and replace them. Similarly, check your power cord for issues and replace it if necessary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you use a gas stove as a heater? Especially in emergencies, when there is no electricity and even central heating turns off, you need a backup heat source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a gas stove at home, then using it could be an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôre going to check &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; you need to know about emergency heating using your gas stove. And you‚Äôre going to learn about better (and more cost-efficient) alternatives to gas stoves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/do-propane-heaters-need-electricity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do propane heaters need electricity? There are two kinds of propane heaters. Those that need electricity, and those that don‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, you will learn which propane heaters you can use without electricity, completely off-grid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you will learn about the types of propane heaters that use electricity and &lt;em&gt;why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;No, portable propane heaters never need electricity and work fully off-grid. However, central heating propane furnaces need electricity to run their built-in electronic thermostat, timers, and fans. Also, some RV propane heaters rely on the 12V car battery to run. Because only portable propane heaters work without electricity, you should always have one at home as an emergency heat source. Alternatively, you can power your propane furnace off a generator.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;People answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù everywhere without actually proving their point somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to place my three space heaters (oil-filled radiator, infrared heater, and propane heater) on top of a living room table and see if anything happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I am going to prove that you can place your space heater on tables as well using simple physics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/why-is-infrared-hotter-than-visible-light/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why is infrared radiation hotter than visible light? Why do we use infrared heaters and not &lt;em&gt;visible&lt;/em&gt; light heaters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, you will find out why infrared radiation is so common in heating and what makes infrared the only reasonable heat source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Infrared radiation is not hotter than visible light. Most radiators (in a physical sense), however, emit the majority of their heat as infrared radiation. This makes infrared heat the most common form of heat in your everyday life. A single-wavelength visible light laser or LED shows that you do perceive visible light as heat as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/dyson-fan-not-rotating/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s frustrating to find out that your Dyson fan is no longer rotating. Obviously, how would you circulate the air in your room without this feature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Dyson fan may have stopped oscillating for several reasons. And usually, the issue is relatively easy to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I will share with you the most common reasons why your Dyson fan isn&amp;rsquo;t oscillating, along with troubleshooting and fixing instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Dyson heaters usually don‚Äôt rotate if there‚Äôs still tape on your Dyson fan&amp;rsquo;s base body split section. Additionally, if the fan doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit right in its base and dust accumulates in the oscillation system (oscillation motor), the system won&amp;rsquo;t work and thus won&amp;rsquo;t oscillate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your propane heater turns on but keeps shutting off? After reading this article, you will know what to do to fix your propane heater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve listed the most common causes for your propane heater not staying lit along with an explanation, and a way to test for and fix each cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Propane heaters usually keep shutting off and don‚Äôt stay lit because of a dirty pilot light or thermocouple. A thorough cleaning of your pilot light with rubbing alcohol and a Q-tip should fix it. Also, ensure your gas line has no kinks and you don‚Äôt move it while heating. If this doesn‚Äôt work, a triggered safety mechanism such as tip-over protection or overheat protection could be the cause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you get CO poisoning from a ventless heater?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, you can &lt;em&gt;theoretically&lt;/em&gt; get carbon monoxide poisoning from a ventless heater. However, it is very unlikely as long as you vent your room every few hours. Ventless space heaters are among the most common source of carbon monoxide poisoning in homes. Modern ventless heaters are designed not to produce CO when functioning properly, but many factors, including poor ventilation and dirt, can make the heater less than safe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How long does a Propane Tank last on a Patio Heater?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/how-long-does-a-propane-tank-last-on-a-patio-heater/</link>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-long-does-a-propane-tank-last-on-a-patio-heater/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How long does a propane tank last on a patio heater? The answer to this question depends on several factors, such as propane tank size, the heating capacity of the patio heater, propane burning efficiency, and the quantity of propane in the tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to help you better understand, I will look at all the factors and calculate how long your propane tank would last on your patio heater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;An average patio heater (45,000 BTU/h) lasts 7 hours with a 20lb propane tank, 10 hours with a 30lb propane tank, and 13 hours with a 40lb propane tank. A propane tank‚Äôs running duration depends on its size, the heat capacity of the heater, and the burning efficiency of your patio heater. Patio heaters between 10,000 BTU/h and 50,000 BTU/h with a 20lb propane tank would last 30 hours to 6 hours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do infrared heaters need venting? In this article, we‚Äôre going to have a quick check!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;No, you never need to vent an electric infrared heater. Electric infrared heaters don‚Äôt burn fuel or gas. Therefore, they emit no waste gases or water vapor. Only fuel or gas-based heaters need venting. However, you can run a portable propane infrared heater without venting for a few hours. You will only have to vent your room occasionally. Other gas or fuel-based heaters need a fixed vent installation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-to-make-an-infrared-heater-more-efficient/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing the efficiency of an infrared heater is easy, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a technician to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will give you some tips for increasing infrared heater efficiency and reducing energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick Answer:¬† &lt;strong&gt;You can increase your infrared heater&amp;rsquo;s perceived efficiency by adequately insulating your room (windows, cracks, and gaps below the door). Also, place your infrared heater facing into the room, or facing directly toward people. The technical efficiency of infrared heaters is always 100% since all electric energy ends as heat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/can-you-run-an-infrared-heater-overnight/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you run an infrared heater all night? In this article, we‚Äôre going to measure the temperature of my infrared heater‚Äôs heating elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we can check whether this temperature is night-safe (i.e. will it burn or melt anything?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I am going to recommend you a night-safe infrared heater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, you can run a quality infrared heater overnight given it is made of fireproof material and has built-in overheat protection. The radius of up to 2 feet in front of a space heater has to be free of any objects, as within this radius high temperatures up to 750¬∞F can occur. Place your infrared heater at a safe distance from your bed without any objects blocking the heat radiation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-to-insulate-a-window-ac/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How can you insulate a window air conditioner? Usually, the window kit that comes with a window AC does not fit perfectly and leaves room for heat to enter your room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let‚Äôs have a look at some improvements you can make to improve your window AC‚Äôs insulation (and, therefore, its &lt;a href=&#34;https://heatertips.com/how-to-make-a-window-ac-more-efficient/&#34;&gt;cost-efficiency&lt;/a&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;You can add insulation around a window AC by gluing styrofoam panels around the sides. To close all air gaps, use spray foam or foam tape. If available, close your outdoor shutters to reduce the amount of heat entering your room.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-to-make-a-window-ac-more-efficient/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Window ACs are power-hungry! Even though they are one of the most-efficient AC types, their running cost adds up over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain 3 essential things you should do to make your window AC more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick Answer: &lt;strong&gt;You can make your window AC more efficient by insulating windows and gaps below your door. Also, clean the evaporator coil and air filter. To avoid efficiency-decreasing dirt accumulation, clean your window AC‚Äôs internals yearly. Additionally, use high-quality extension cords (instead of cheap ones) and run your AC on a moderate cooling setting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can Candles cause Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/can-candles-cause-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 20:52:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/can-candles-cause-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, candles can cause carbon monoxide poisoning, but it‚Äôs highly unlikely. Candles produce very little carbon monoxide. That‚Äôs not enough to cause poisoning unless you light many candles in a small, unventilated space, which would increase carbon monoxide emissions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn‚Äôt mean lighting candles is 100% safe. Since carbon monoxide is undetectable by all five senses, it can be difficult to establish when the CO from candles is nearing dangerous levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you use an oil-filled radiator in an RV? Sure! But you have to make sure you use a proper power source!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, you can use an oil-filled radiator in an RV. You can run any oil-filled radiator off shore power, off a generator, or off the batteries using an inverter. However, electric heating is not always the most cost-effective form of heating when you are off-grid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôre going to check all you need to know about oil-filled radiators. And in the end, we‚Äôll see whether there are better heating options for your RV!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Quick Answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, you can use an oil-filled radiator in a bathroom. The large metal heating body is completely safe, even when water is splashed on it. Only the front panel of an oil-filled radiator contains sensitive electronics. So, avoid exposing it to water. An electric shock from an oil-filled radiator by accident is almost impossible unless you really try. Also, oil-filled radiators need no ventilation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can you burn Coal in a Wood Stove?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/can-you-burn-coal-in-a-wood-stove/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 13:05:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/can-you-burn-coal-in-a-wood-stove/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coal has been used to heat homes and workplaces for centuries, but is it possible to burn coal in a wood stove?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;It is not recommended to burn coal in a wood stove. While it is possible, it is not efficient and can cause damage to your stove. A coal stove needs a grate at the bottom in order to allow air from below the fire to burn efficiently. Without this grate, wood stoves won&amp;rsquo;t be able to burn coal properly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Improve Oil-filled Radiator Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/how-to-improve-oil-filled-radiator-efficiency/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 10:42:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-to-improve-oil-filled-radiator-efficiency/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How can you improve the heating and cost-efficiency of an oil-filled radiator?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three different efficiencies that we want to optimize for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical efficiency - How much electricity is converted to heat?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perceived efficiency - How much heat does actually reach you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost efficiency - How much heat do you get for your money‚Äôs worth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we are going to cover all three different kinds of efficiencies. For each efficiency type, I am going to give you straight-to-the-point advice on how to optimize your oil-filled radiator!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why is my Propane Heater using so much gas?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/why-is-propane-heater-using-so-much-gas/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 10:27:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/why-is-propane-heater-using-so-much-gas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If your propane heater uses too much gas, it&amp;rsquo;s time to check for possible reasons and fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m going to reveal some of the major causes that are messing with your propane heater and causing it to consume more gas than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also going to highlight some precautions you should take if you want your propane heater to consume less gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick Answer: &lt;strong&gt;Your Propane heater consumes more gas than usual if there is a leakage in the gas tank, hose, or heater itself. Also, a lack of insulation, or using undersized heaters in large rooms can increase gas consumption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How long does a 100lb propane tank last?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/how-long-does-a-100lb-propane-tank-last/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 13:31:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-long-does-a-100lb-propane-tank-last/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How long a 100lb propane tank lasts depends entirely on the propane heater that you connect to it. While a small heater can run for many weeks, a very strong industrial-grade heater will only last one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;A 100lb propane tank lasts anywhere between 13 hours to 576 hours depending on the heating power. On an average household 9,000 BTU heater, it will last for 192 hours of heating. On a (very) strong industrial-grade torpedo heater it will last 13 hours only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/can-you-run-wood-stove-pipe-through-window/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you run a wood stove pipe through a window?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wood stove pipe connects the chimney to the stove, and it&amp;rsquo;s meant to exhaust fumes out of your home. But what if your house or RV doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a chimney?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, you can run a wood stove pipe through a window by using a pre-made window plate kit or making one yourself using double-walled metal pipes and a metal sheet to cover the window space. Ensure the pipe is angled upwards and lifted above the roof to increase efficiency.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can you run two Portable ACs at once?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/can-you-run-two-portable-air-conditioners-at-once/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 17:22:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/can-you-run-two-portable-air-conditioners-at-once/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Running two portable air conditioners simultaneously on the same circuit is not a good practice, as it will increase energy consumption or may trip your circuit breaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, if you want to run two portable ACs simultaneously, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you whether you can do it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you an alternative to portable ACs that will consume less energy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick Answer: &lt;strong&gt;You can run two portable air conditioners at the same time on the same circuit if they do not draw current more than the ampere rating of the circuit (15A - 20A). A 15A circuit and 110V - 120V outlet voltage (US) will not support two portable air conditioners. On the other hand, you can easily run two portable air conditioners when the outlet voltage is 220V - 230V (Europe and UK) and the circuit ampere rating is 15A - 20A.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/where-to-place-an-infrared-heater/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs the best place to put your space heater? In the corners? Or in the middle of the room?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôre going to check different space heater placements and how they affect your heater‚Äôs efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;You should place your space heater facing toward the center of the room or the area where people are. The closer you place your heater to people, the higher the perceived heat, but the worse is the area coverage of the infrared radiation. The infrared heater‚Äôs radiation should not be blocked by any objects in between. You can safely place your infrared heater on the floor or on the carpet as long as no pets are around.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you use a space heater as a heat source for your sauna? Yes! In this article, I am going to tell you exactly what you have to do and what you should consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, you can use space heaters to heat a sauna. However, you either have to use two electric space heaters without built-in thermostats simultaneously or one propane gas heater for heating. Adding insulation to your sauna helps increase to raise the possible maximum temperature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/do-heat-pumps-dry-the-air/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do heat pumps dry the air? In this article, we‚Äôre going to check if a heat pump will dehumidify your room‚Äôs air (Spoiler: They don‚Äôt, but the air feels dryer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, we‚Äôre going to check how you can keep your room‚Äôs humidity at a comfortable level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;No, heat pumps do not dry the air. Instead, they reduce the air&amp;rsquo;s relative humidity, making it feel dryer. This phenomenon is typical to all heaters and not specific to heat pumps. The reduced relative humidity is what you perceive as dry air. In case you prefer humid air, you will need a humidifier.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 Quietest Portable Air Conditioners (47dB - 52dB)</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/quietest-portable-air-conditioners/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 14:07:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/quietest-portable-air-conditioners/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are the 5 quietest portable air conditioners between 47dB and 52dB. You‚Äôll find all cooling capacities between 8,000 BTU and 14,000 BTU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each quiet portable air conditioner, I‚Äôll also list the room size each model is good for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;The quietest portable air conditioner is a 47dB TOSOT unit. After that, most quiet air conditioners are rated either 51dB or 52dB. An average portable air conditioner is 56dB, which is&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;more because each 3dB increase doubles the perceived noise volume.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people are confused about which type of portable air conditioner to buy. If you are also questioning whether to buy a single-hose or dual-hose AC, here&amp;rsquo;s your answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual-hose portable air conditioners are more efficient than single-hose as they don&amp;rsquo;t suck any outdoor air into the room due to negative pressure. A dual-hose unit is perfect for larger spaces because it can cool an area more quickly and efficiently than a single-hose AC.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Air conditioners for small rooms should not take up much space, effectively cool your room, and don‚Äôt consume much electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôre going to check the best air conditioners for small rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;The best air conditioner for small rooms is a 5,000 BTU window air conditioner. Getting a larger air conditioner and cooling your entire living space (instead of just one small room) is even more cost-effective because small rooms can‚Äôt keep the cold air for long and heat up quickly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-long-do-oil-filled-radiators-last/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oil-filled radiators last a long time. In our wood workshop, we have a 30-year-old oil-filled radiator that‚Äôs still fully functional. In comparison, other space heater types age much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s check what makes an oil-filled radiator last for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also, I am going to tell you what you can do to increase your oil radiator‚Äôs lifespan &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;An oil-filled radiator lasts at least 20+ years. If it is not exposed to weather and large temperature changes, then it can easily work well beyond 30 years. The main reason is that oil-filled radiators don‚Äôt have any built-in moving parts that wear down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can you Run Two Space Heaters at once? (Experiment Confirmed)</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/can-you-run-two-space-heaters-at-once/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 12:20:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/can-you-run-two-space-heaters-at-once/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can run two space heaters at once almost anywhere in the world except in the US. Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôre going to find this out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;On regular US 120V wall outlets you can run two space heaters at once on reduced heating settings only (80% or less). On 220V-240V (eg. UK, Europe) power outlets you can run two space heaters on full power since more voltage means less amperage which means less tripping of circuit breakers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What‚Äôs the Difference between a Window vs Split AC?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/whats-the-difference-between-window-ac-and-split-ac/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 11:34:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/whats-the-difference-between-window-ac-and-split-ac/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Window ACs and Split ACs differ in their internal structure. But the difference is not only technical. It also affects the efficiency, cost, noise, and installation cost of the different AC types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Window ACs are window-mounted, low-cost, but noisy. Split ACs are wall-mounted, rather expensive, but more powerful and quiet. Both window and split ACs have a similar cooling efficiency. Technically they are equally capable of cooling large rooms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/what-size-generator-can-run-a-heat-pump/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Only home standby generators can power heat pumps larger than 2 tons. However, even smaller heat pumps require expertise in wiring and setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we‚Äôre going to check the wattages, different heat pump sizes use, and which generators suit each heat pump size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Only a home standby generator can power a medium-sized heat pump. Small heat pumps of 1-2 tons can be powered off large portable generators. However, getting a portable generator just for powering a heat pump is cost-inefficient. Rather, consider getting a wood stove or a propane heater. These provide more BTUs of heat energy for less money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-to-heat-a-large-room/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To heat a large room using wood can be as cheap as $300 a year. With space heaters, you‚Äôll pay around $54 - $108 a month.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs never easy to find a heat source that is well-suited for large rooms. Either you have to pay a lot, or it‚Äôs hard to install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, you can always turn up your central heater‚Äôs temperature settings. However, that increases your heating bill significantly. Central heating heats the entire home and, therefore, produces more heat than is needed for a single room.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why does your portable air conditioner collect no water? In this article, we‚Äôre checking 5 possible reasons and how to fix them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Your portable air conditioner collects no water because it is either broken or the water tank leaks. Low air humidity is also a potential cause. Another cause is that your portable AC is an evaporative cooler, which does not collect water.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs have a look at each of those reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Window units are designed specifically to be mounted on a window. The warm air and water produced during the cooling process escape to the outdoors through the window. But if you don‚Äôt have a suitable window in that room, you can improvise another way to remove those by-products without a window.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to remove mold in a portable air conditioner? AC units provide the perfect conditions for mold to grow-oxygen, moisture and matter. And since they push air around your house, it means a moldy air conditioner will be blowing microscopic mold spores into the air you breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do Portable Air Conditioners give off Carbon Monoxide?</title>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/portable-air-conditioner-carbon-monoxide/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do portable air conditioners give off carbon monoxide? There are two reasons why many homeowners ask this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer &lt;strong&gt;: No, portable air conditioners do not give off carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is only created from fuel-burning devices such as furnaces, gas stoves, and generators. Portable ACs use electricity so there is no risk of them emitting carbon monoxide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few uncommon situations whereby your portable AC could be involved in circulating carbon monoxide in your home. Read on to learn the real culprits you should be worrying about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/do-portable-air-conditioners-need-to-be-vented/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do all portable air conditioners need to be vented? If so, why do all air conditioners need a hose? And can you use a portable AC without a hose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, all portable air conditioners need to be vented. The heat extracted from the air has to leave your room, otherwise, it will mix up with the cold air again. Ventless ACs are a marketing scam and never work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you have to put water in a portable air conditioner? The answer to this question uncovers a huge marketing scam, so keep reading until the end. You‚Äôll be shocked. But before that, here‚Äôs the quick answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;You don‚Äôt have to put water in a portable air conditioner. Portable air conditioners extract heat from the air and vent it out the window. The cooling process condensates water which accumulates in the air conditioner. Rather, you have to drain water from your portable AC. Any air conditioner where you put in water or ice cubes is a junk product!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do portable air conditioners need regassing? Do you need to put in any maintenance work? Your portable AC&amp;rsquo;s efficiency decreased any you suspect the refrigerant needs a refill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Portable air conditioners never need regassing. Portable ACs are fully enclosed systems and refrigerant will never leak if the device is not broken. If it is broken, you should just replace it with a new one and not worry about maintenance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 07:50:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-does-a-portable-air-conditioner-work/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does a portable air conditioner work? Air conditioners work ‚Äúmagically‚Äù and nobody ever fully gets them. As an electrical engineer, I try to break up the answer to this question into digestible chunks everybody can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Like a regular air conditioner, a portable air conditioner cools the air by evaporating a refrigerant that carries the absorbed heat from your room outdoors. Since a portable air conditioner has no outdoor parts which ensure that no heat is carried back into the room, it is not as efficient as a regular air conditioner.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-to-make-a-portable-air-conditioner-quiet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to make a portable air conditioner quiet? What&amp;rsquo;s the best way to silence a noisy portable AC?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found lots of useless and ridiculous advice online, such as wrapping your portable AC in blankets. Not only do tips of this kind not work, but they are even dangerous.&lt;br&gt;
This article deals with the few tips that will really get you a silent portable air conditioner. Just follow along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;You can only make a portable air conditioner quieter by placing it on an anti-vibration pad and lowering the power settings. Soundproofing an AC is likely to overheat it and decreases the cooling efficiency. If your portable air conditioner is old (10 years or more), I would suggest you replace it. Modern air conditioners are significantly quieter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you use an extension cord for a portable air conditioner? In this article, we‚Äôre going to explore the art of using extension cords with portable ACs and how to stay safe at all times!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extension cords are one of the weak points when using portable ACs. Generally, portable ACs are very safe. However, they need lots of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when a weak extension cord has to handle too much power, it can melt or even catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Which space heater size do you need? How many Watts do you need? Most guides online, when googling for this question, give you formulas to calculate the needed wattage based on the size of your room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is an over-complication of the approach to solving the question and an oversimplification of the real world. A simple formula can‚Äôt consider all boundary conditions in your home: What‚Äôs the exact volume of your living space? How well insulated is your home? How moist is the air? What kind of furniture do you have? What‚Äôs the weather like outside? Are doors kept open or closed?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are wood stove fans worth it? And do they really work? In this article, we‚Äôre looking at wood stove fans, what they are, how they work, and whether you should get one. Also, we‚Äôre clearing up some common misconceptions. So let‚Äôs jump right in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Wood stove fans are worth it, but only for smaller rooms. They will help distribute the hot air a little but are more of a toy and nice to look at as a design item. If you seriously have to distribute heat in your home, you should use an electric floor fan. Floor fans are very powerful and are able to quickly move large amounts of air between and within rooms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;All quality space heaters theoretically are safe to run 24h a day. As long as you are in the same room, you can leave a space heater on. Modern space heaters have built-in safety features such as a temperature controlling thermostat, tip-over protection, and overheat protection, which reduce risk of fire.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you put a space heater on carpet? Or should you rather place them on the bare floor? And what if your floor is fully carpeted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou should never sit a space heater on a carpet or area rug. The carpet will trap the heat, and the build-up of heat may cause a fire.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your space heater is not blowing hot air and you don‚Äôt know how to fix it? In this article, we are going to go through potential causes. Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not going to be too technical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after reading this, you will know exactly how you can fix your issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;When a space heater blows cold air or no air at all, it is usually due to a hardware failure. Some part of the electronic circuitry is likely broken. If your space heater does not blow air at all, it is likely that either the fan is broken or it does not receive enough power. Usually, fixing a space heater yourself is not worth it and dangerous. Instead, just buy a new one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/are-pelonis-heaters-energy-efficient/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are Pelonis heaters energy efficient? The answer to this question is very simple. Yes, Pelonis heaters are energy efficient. But let‚Äôs have a closer look at what that means and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, technically, Pelonis heaters are 100% energy efficient. The reason is that all the input power from your wall outlet is converted to heat. There is no difference in efficiency between different heater brands. It might only be the case that some heaters feel more efficient than others because they heat up quicker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to assemble an oil heater. Assembling an oil heater is actually very easy, once you understand how it‚Äôs done. Since there are only confusing resources online, I created this helpful picture guide with real-life pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just recently I received an oil-filled radiator myself. I did not even know that I have to assemble it myself. This presented itself as an opportunity for writing this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;Assembling an oil heater is simple. First, attach the wheels to the brackets. Then use the bent metal connectors to attach the brackets (with wheels) to the bottom of the oil heater. Place the oil heater upright. Wait a minute for the oil to flow down. And then turn the oil heater on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/best-programmable-space-heater/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre having a look at the 3 best programmable space heaters. I took a deep dive into programmable space heaters for you and found 3 different heaters that are a good bang for the buck. All 3 heaters differ a little bit, but I will explain everything to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs one thing all 3 best programmable space heaters have in common: They are oil-filled radiators. I chose to stick to oil-filled radiators because I am convinced that once you are looking for a programmable space heater, you want to be able to leave it running independently of you. You want to automate the heating times and the temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How much does an Oil-filled Radiator weigh?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/how-much-does-an-oil-filled-radiator-weigh/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 16:05:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/how-much-does-an-oil-filled-radiator-weigh/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How much does an oil-filled radiator weigh? The weight of an oil heater becomes important when you are moving it frequently. Especially when you get one heater to heat multiple rooms, it is important, that the heater is easy to carry around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, when you have children or pets at home, having a heavy heater is an advantage. Heavy heaters stand their place and do not tip over as easily as lightweight space heaters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do Oil Heaters need to be refilled?</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/do-oil-heaters-need-to-be-refilled/</link>

      <guid>https://heatertips.com/do-oil-heaters-need-to-be-refilled/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre just getting into oil-filled radiators, you might wonder if oil heaters need to be refilled? Does an electric oil radiator run out of oil? Luckily, this question is easy to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;No, oil heaters do not need to be filled. An oil heater should never run out of oil. The metal heating body has no openings. Since it is a closed system, the oil cannot leak. At least as long as the heater is undamaged and in a good condition. However, yes a damaged heater can run out of oil. In this case, you should replace the heater. An oil heater that runs out of oil is not a reliable and safe source of heat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How long does a wood stove take to heat up? To answer this question, I could measure just the heat-up time of my own wood stove for you and give you the numbers. However, that is not the best way to get accurate numbers. Your home is different than mine and therefore your numbers will vary. To find accurate numbers I have collected stove heat-up times from various people around the web and compiled them in this article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do convection heaters work? In this article, we‚Äôll take a look at that. After reading this short convection heater guide, you‚Äôll understand how convection heaters work. In my explanations, I‚Äôll stick to a very intuitive level. Let‚Äôs just avoid the detailed physics. We all had enough of it in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the short answer: &lt;strong&gt;Convection heaters work using a heating coil that produces hot air. The hot air is then distributed by a fan or by a large metal surface. Convection heaters use the air as a medium to transport the heat. Either they heat up air and then blow it across the room to distribute it. Or they make use of the natural rising of warm air, which ensures that the heat distributes itself. Keep reading to find out more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs the best infrared heater? I tried, tested and researched several infrared heaters and came to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to pick a model where you get the most out of your money. I don‚Äôt want you to waste time and energy on buying heaters that will last you only a few months or can‚Äôt deliver the heat you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here‚Äôs the short version: The best infrared heater in terms of quality, price, and reliability is by far the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Infrared-Heater-Portable-1500-Watt/dp/B002QZ11J6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=1Z796YYBSCYXT&amp;amp;keywords=dr+infrared+heater&amp;amp;qid=1578427646&amp;amp;sprefix=dr+infrare,aps,278&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;amp;linkId=e84d6163b83a30dbc5a70e5a5f4b38e0&amp;amp;language=en_US&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Infrared Heater Dr-968 (click to view it on amazon)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;. Among all infrared heaters, it is my favorite, because, in contrast to other models, it is able to keep the temperature of big rooms high, even when it‚Äôs the only heat source in your home in mid-winter. The Dr Infrared Heater is incredibly good to have for emergencies and whenever you need a reliable heat source. It comes with all the safety features you need and has a built-in thermostat (which is unusual for infrared heaters).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How much does a space heater cost to run? Here&amp;rsquo;s everything you need to know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we&amp;rsquo;re comparing the electricity cost of 21 different space heaters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll help you decide whether you can afford to run a space heater. And also, I am giving you a simple formula to calculate the exact electricity cost of your space heater model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick answer: &lt;strong&gt;A space heater costs $54 per month to run if you use it for 8 hours every day. I assumed an average 1500W space heater and the average US electricity rate of 15 cents per Kilowatt-hour for the calculation. If you run your space heater on lower settings or for shorter durations, the cost to run your space heater decreases accordingly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your space heater makes a clicking noise and you‚Äôre not sure where it‚Äôs coming from and whether your heater is broken?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve had this myself: I was comfortably sitting on my couch, with my infrared heater keeping my feet warm. It was really comfortable and I totally concentrated on the book. All of a sudden, there was a loud clicking noise. It was a quick clicking sound, just like the sound you often hear right after turning on an oven or an air conditioner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too dry air will make your skin feel dried out and your throat can get sore. Too humid air will make you feel sweaty at home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are there any space heaters with long cords? I just had to answer this question, when I noticed that my space heater cord isn‚Äôt long enough to place my heater anywhere I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To find the space heater with the longest cords, I‚Äôve researched for hours, browsing through product descriptions and manuals to find the lengths of the cords of dozens of space heaters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was pretty difficult to get the values. It seems like companies try to hide the cord length on purpose. But why?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That question first got me thinking when I was on a boat trip on the Rhine river in Germany in the springtime and all the passengers shivered throughout the tour: There was no heater on the boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is heating a boat cabin important? By heating a boat, you not only feel more comfortable, but you also benefit some technical aspects of the boat: Heat protects the water and sewage system and the engine compartment from freezing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
