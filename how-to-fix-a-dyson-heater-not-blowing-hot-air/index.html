The usual cause for this is blocked airways, issues with the thermostat, or a broken part in the electronic circuitry.\nIn this article, you will find each of the most common causes as well as instructions on how to inspect and test and fix the respective cause.\nQuick answer: Your Dyson heater usually does not blow hot air if the airways are blocked with dust, dirt, and moisture. You can fix this by dry-brushing the internal parts using a toothbrush. Also, clean all of the air inlet holes in the case of the heater. Set your thermostat properly. And inspect the electronic circuitry if it still does not work.\nLet’s have a look at each of these steps and finally fix your Dyson heater!\nHow to fix your Dyson Heater not blowing hot air The number one reason for a Dyson heater not blowing hot air is that its airways are clogged.\nDysons accumulate dust, moisture, and oil over time. When you use your Dyson heater for a long time, it’s very likely that the accumulated dirt mix blocks the air and prevents proper heating.\nDyson heaters accumulate dust in the following areas:\nOn the air filter Inside the case where the electronics and the fan sit In the “loop amplifier”. That’s the big circular fan slit on top of your Dyson heater. If you clean these thoroughly and take your time, then I’d say the chance is 95% your Dyson heater will blow hot air again.\nLet’s have a look at each of those dust-accumulating spots:\nClean clogged internal parts Over time, the internal parts located inside the case of your Dyson heater will get dusty.\nHow to test: Open the bottom part of your Dyson Hot + Cool heater. To do that you can turn your Dyson heater upside down (with the bottom control panel now facing upwards).\nThen push back the control panel (yes, it moves) and you will see a few screws which you have to unscrew.\nThen push the control panel in the other direction and you will find more screws to unscrew on the other side. Remove those.\nAfter removing all of the screws, you can lift off the bottom part of your Dyson heater and you should be able to look inside it.\nAre your internals dusty and dirty? If yes, then that’s one major cause of your Dyson heater not working.\nHow to fix: Ensure your Dyson heater is unplugged from the wall outlet. Use either a strong vacuum cleaner or a compressed air gun to remove the dust.\nBe careful not to bump the vacuum cleaner into the electronics as this could break off soldered parts.\nWith a compressed air gun, you can just blow all of the dust out of your Dyson heater. Just make sure you don’t hold it too close to any electronic circuitry that you could damage.\nAlternatively, if you don’t have a good vacuum cleaner or a compressed air gun, just dry brush the internals using a toothbrush.\nThis will take a bit longer, but the result will be the same.\nDusty internal components in a Dyson Hot + Cool blocking the airflow\nNow that the internal parts are clean and dusted, let’s continue with the next step.\nClean air inlet holes around the case All Dyson heaters have air inlet holes around the bottom part. These air inlet holes have to be open for the fan to be able to draw air into the airways.\nIf your Dyson heater’s air inlet holes are blocked, your fan is not able to blow any air.\nThe air inlet holes are especially prone to accumulate dirt since they sit in front of the air filter and the air passing through the holes is not filtered yet.\nHow to test: You should open your Dyson heater’s case (as described in the previous section).\nYou can then hold your Dyson heater against a light source (lamp or window) and see if the holes are open or blocked.\nThe holes are open if light passes through them. They are blocked if you can only see black, or reduced light.\nHow to fix: If your heater’s air inlet holes are dirty, you will have to clean them from the outside and the inside of your case.\nHere’s one important note:\nI see everyone online recommending to clean your Dyson heater’s case using kitchen cleaner or water.\nHowever, I recommend you try to dry- clean the air inlet holes first. The reason is that wet cleaning will moisturize the dirt and increase mold growth.\nI did this one time and my device started stinking so much that I could not use it anymore.\nSo, you can use a dry toothbrush to clean the air inlet holes.\nYou can poke through the holes with a toothpick and loosen any hardened dirt.\nAlso, you can try to blow out any dirt with your compressed air gun (if you have one).\nNow that the internals and the air inlet holes are done, try to run your Dyson heater and see if it is blowing hot air now. It is very likely that you already fixed your problem!\nIf it’s still not working, let’s continue:\nClean the clogged loop amplifier The loop amplifier is the large circular slit sitting on top of your Dyson heater. It’s the part where the air comes out.\nDyson got really fancy here. The “amplifier” is just a large slit through which the fan presses the air.\nAccording to Bernoulli’s principle the air’s velocity increases, while its cross-section of the air decreases. So, the amount (volume per time unit) of air that blows into your room is constant and does not even change…\nAnyways, because Dyson heaters press air through this thin slit, they are very dust-sensitive. Even a little dust inside the loop amplifier will harm the airflow significantly.\nHow to test: You can run your Dyson heater in cooling mode and see whether air blows out the loop amplifier evenly. Or is there any part of the loop amplifier that blows more air than another part?\nIdeally, air should evenly leave your Dyson heater.\nYou can also unmount the loop amplifier and turn your Dyson heater on. Listen and feel how much air the fan blows. Then mount the loop amplifier again and compare whether anything changes.\nDoes the fan sound any different now? Does it still blow the same amount of air? If the airflow changes after mounting the loop amplifier, the airways inside the loop amplifier are likely blocked.\nHow to fix: Unmount the loop amplifier and dry brush the slit. Brush a toothbrush along the opening of the loop amplifier.\nMount the loop amplifier again and start your Dyson heater. Does the airflow improve?\nReplace or remove the air filter All air in a Dyson heater passes through the air filter. Your heater’s air filter is another spot where dirt and dust accumulate and block proper airflow.\nIdeally, you should replace your air filters every 12 months (at least, according to Dyson). If you don’t do that, or you were not even aware of that, then obstructed air filters are a likely problem.\nHow to test: Open your Dyson heater and remove the air filters. You can check your manual for how to do it with your specific heater model. Every model is slightly different.\nUsually, it’s a simple lifting of the loop amplifier and then just removing the case parts with the air inlet holes. Then, you can directly access the air filters.\nHow to fix: If your air filters are clogged you can do three different things. All of them will improve the airflow, but only one is a solution Dyson likes:\nReplace the air filter Clean the air filter Remove the air filter Guess which one Dyson prefers? Right, the first one.\nReplacing the air filters is usually the best option since it fixes your airflow problem and it improves the air quality.\nHowever, if you are short on cash or you want to fix your Dyson heater now, you can just dry-brush the excess dirt using a toothbrush. This will not get rid of all the fine dust particles.\nBut it might be enough to unclog your heater for proper airflow again.\nThe third option is to remove the air filter entirely. Now, this is highly discouraged by Dyson as it voids your warranty. Dyson claims that this can damage your heater’s internals.\nBut I think removing the air filters is just fine for a quick check of whether the air filter is your problem or not.\nIf your Dyson heater blows hot air when running it without a filter, you can tell for sure that the air filter is the cause of the problem.\nThat’s it. The airway-cleaning tips we just covered will get 95% of Dyson heaters working again. Make sure you follow them closely and I am sure your Dyson heater will work just fine.\nIf your heater still does not blow hot air, here’s what else you should check.\nSet a target temperature above room temperature Dyson heaters have a built-in thermostat. On the front panel of your Dyson heater, you can set the target temperature of your room. That’s the temperature you want your room to be.\nThe target temperature is not the temperature of the air coming out of your heater. That’s a common misconception.\nIf the target temperature is below room temperature, the heater won’t turn on.\nHow to test: Set your Dyson heater to the highest setting (99°F / 37°C) and see if it heats.\nIf your Dyson heater starts heating now, but not at your desired target temperature, this simply means that the target temperature is likely below the current room temperature.\nHow to fix: There’s no fix for this. If you want your Dyson heater to blow hot air, increase the target temperature setting on the front panel.\nIt should be working then.\nWait for the Dyson heater to heat up After turning on your Dyson heater, it does not immediately blow how air. Most Dyson heaters need around 1 minute to start the heating after turning on.\nAnd additionally, the heating elements which are located on either side of the loop amplifier turn on one at a time. This causes the heater to blow hot air on one side of the loop amplifier before the other side starts getting warm.\nI have no idea what the technical reason for this might be. It might have something to do with the control algorithm of the thermostat. Or it could reduce tension in the plastic case from sudden heating.\nHow to test: Run your Dyson heater for more than a minute. Does it get warm now?\nHow to fix: Unfortunately, there is no fix for this. Dyson heaters (and almost all other kinds of heaters) need time to heat up.\nYou just need to be more patient.\nFix blown or broken parts in the electronic circuitry It could also be that your Dyson heater has an internal electronic issue. It could be that the power module does not deliver enough power to run the heating elements.\nOr it could be that the thermostat’s thermometer is broken and returns wrong values to the thermostat (which causes it to think that your room is already at target temperature and needs no heating).\nHow to test: This one is a little advanced, but it should be doable for everyone who likes to repair electronics.\nOpen the Dyson heater’s case until you see the electronic circuitry. I find the simplest way to inspect electronics is to just look at all the parts.\nUse a flashlight and a magnifying glass to check all of the small resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits.\nAre there burn marks around any of the parts? Is a connection of any part broken? Is a component hovering a tenth of a millimeter above a connection without actually touching it? (Yes, I’ve seen all of these things).\nIf you find something, note the part number (if there is any), or try to find online what part it is.\nHow to fix: Get a replacement part. Replace the broken part with your replacement. Likely, you will have to use a soldering iron. Use plenty of flux to make a good connection.\nRun your Dyson heater and see if it starts blowing hot air now.\nIf you find an issue and you know which part is broken, but you can’t properly fix it yourself, you can ask an electrician (or maybe a family member who knows how to solder) to do it for you.\nWhat to do if your Dyson heater is still not heating? If you follow all of the above steps your Dyson heater should be heating.\nBut if yours still does not, I’d recommend just getting a new heater. My personal recommendation would be this Dyson Hot + Coo l (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis one is a perfectly good 1,500W Dyson heater.\nThere’s just one more thing I have to say before you splurge on another Dyson product.\nGet a Dyson only if you really enjoyed your current model. Similar to Apple products, Dyson is a brand that values design, quality, and user experience a lot.\nBut you have to pay a high price for that.\nSo, only get a Dyson heater if it’s truly worth it for you.\nDesign, quality, and user experience are perfectly valid buying justifications. Just like many people prefer luxury cars over cheaper cars with the same horsepower.\nIf, however, you only need a heat source, and you don’t really care about the design of the heater, then you should get a regular oil-filled radiator, such as this Pelonis oil-filled radiator (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis oil-filled radiator produces the exact same amount of heat as the Dyson Hot + Cool, but it’s a lot cheaper.\nIt’s my personal favorite electric heater, so I am a bit biased. Here’s my review.\nDyson claims that their heaters are more efficient than conventional space heaters. But that is factually not the case. I’ve written an extensive article about why Dyson heaters can’t be more efficient than other space heaters.\nCheck this one out! It will improve your understanding of Dyson’s marketing claims and whether they can withstand fact-checks.\nConclusion You can fix almost any Dyson heater not blowing hot air by cleaning clogged airways. Dust, dirt, and moisture are the most common cause of air not being able to move inside your heater.\nI’d say if you follow this article closely, you are guaranteed to find a fix for your problem!\nEven if you decide to buy a new Dyson heater in the end, you always know which issues to look out for.\nNow you know that you have to maintain Dyson’s airways frequently. When your heater’s airways are blocked, you can quickly check and fix it!\nI hope I could help you resolve your problem. If you still have a question, or if your heater had another problem that’s not listed in this article, then please shoot me a mail!\nI’d love to include your solutions as well!\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Your Dyson heater is not blowing hot air? The usual cause for this is blocked airways, issues with the thermostat, or a broken part in the electronic circuitry.</p>
<p>In this article, you will find each of the most common causes as well as instructions on how to inspect and test and fix the respective cause.</p>
<p>Quick answer: <strong>Your Dyson heater usually does not blow hot air if the airways are blocked with dust, dirt, and moisture. You can fix this by dry-brushing the internal parts using a toothbrush. Also, clean all of the air inlet holes in the case of the heater. Set your thermostat properly. And inspect the electronic circuitry if it still does not work.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s have a look at each of these steps and finally fix your Dyson heater!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-fix-your-dyson-heater-not-blowing-hot-air">How to fix your Dyson Heater not blowing hot air<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-fix-your-dyson-heater-not-blowing-hot-air">#</a></h2>
<p>The number one reason for a Dyson heater not blowing hot air is that its airways are clogged.</p>
<p>Dysons accumulate dust, moisture, and oil over time. When you use your Dyson heater for a long time, it’s very likely that the accumulated dirt mix blocks the air and prevents proper heating.</p>
<p>Dyson heaters accumulate dust in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the air filter</li>
<li>Inside the case where the electronics and the fan sit</li>
<li>In the “loop amplifier”. That’s the big circular fan slit on top of your Dyson heater.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you clean these thoroughly and take your time, then I’d say the chance is 95% your Dyson heater will blow hot air again.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at each of those dust-accumulating spots:</p>
<h3 id="clean-clogged-internal-parts">Clean clogged internal parts<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#clean-clogged-internal-parts">#</a></h3>
<p>Over time, the internal parts located inside the case of your Dyson heater will get dusty.</p>
<p><strong>How to test:</strong> Open the bottom part of your Dyson Hot + Cool heater. To do that you can turn your Dyson heater upside down (with the bottom control panel now facing upwards).</p>
<p>Then push back the control panel (yes, it moves) and you will see a few screws which you have to unscrew.</p>
<p>Then push the control panel in the other direction and you will find more screws to unscrew on the other side. Remove those.</p>
<p>After removing all of the screws, you can lift off the bottom part of your Dyson heater and you should be able to look inside it.</p>
<p>Are your internals dusty and dirty? If yes, then that’s one major cause of your Dyson heater not working.</p>
<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> Ensure your Dyson heater is unplugged from the wall outlet. Use either a strong vacuum cleaner or a compressed air gun to remove the dust.</p>
<p>Be careful not to bump the vacuum cleaner into the electronics as this could break off soldered parts.</p>
<p>With a compressed air gun, you can just blow all of the dust out of your Dyson heater. Just make sure you don’t hold it too close to any electronic circuitry that you could damage.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you don’t have a good vacuum cleaner or a compressed air gun, just dry brush the internals using a toothbrush.</p>
<p>This will take a bit longer, but the result will be the same.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/dyson-hot-cool-heater-dust-internal-components.webp">Dusty internal components in a Dyson Hot + Cool blocking the airflow</p>
<p>Now that the internal parts are clean and dusted, let’s continue with the next step.</p>
<h3 id="clean-air-inlet-holes-around-the-case">Clean air inlet holes around the case<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#clean-air-inlet-holes-around-the-case">#</a></h3>
<p>All Dyson heaters have air inlet holes around the bottom part. These air inlet holes have to be open for the fan to be able to draw air into the airways.</p>
<p>If your Dyson heater’s air inlet holes are blocked, your fan is not able to blow any air.</p>
<p>The air inlet holes are especially prone to accumulate dirt since they sit in front of the air filter and the air passing through the holes is not filtered yet.</p>
<p><strong>How to test:</strong> You should open your Dyson heater’s case (as described in the previous section).</p>
<p>You can then hold your Dyson heater against a light source (lamp or window) and see if the holes are open or blocked.</p>
<p>The holes are open if light passes through them. They are blocked if you can only see black, or reduced light.</p>
<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> If your heater’s air inlet holes are dirty, you will have to clean them from the outside and the inside of your case.</p>
<p>Here’s one important note:</p>
<p>I see everyone online recommending to clean your Dyson heater’s case using kitchen cleaner or water.</p>
<p>However, I recommend you try to <em>dry-</em> clean the air inlet holes first. The reason is that wet cleaning will moisturize the dirt and increase mold growth.</p>
<p>I did this one time and my device started stinking so much that I could not use it anymore.</p>
<p>So, you can use a dry toothbrush to clean the air inlet holes.</p>
<p><strong>You can poke through the holes with a toothpick and loosen any hardened dirt.</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can try to blow out any dirt with your compressed air gun (if you have one).</p>
<p>Now that the internals and the air inlet holes are done, try to run your Dyson heater and see if it is blowing hot air now. It is very likely that you already fixed your problem!</p>
<p>If it’s still not working, let’s continue:</p>
<h3 id="clean-the-clogged-loop-amplifier">Clean the clogged loop amplifier<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#clean-the-clogged-loop-amplifier">#</a></h3>
<p>The loop amplifier is the large circular slit sitting on top of your Dyson heater. It’s the part where the air comes out.</p>
<p>Dyson got really fancy here. The “amplifier” is just a large slit through which the fan presses the air.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle">Bernoulli’s principle</a> the air’s velocity increases, while its cross-section of the air decreases. So, the amount (volume per time unit) of air that blows into your room is constant and does not even change…</p>
<p>Anyways, because Dyson heaters press air through this thin slit, they are very dust-sensitive. Even a little dust inside the loop amplifier will harm the airflow significantly.</p>
<p><strong>How to test:</strong> You can run your Dyson heater in cooling mode and see whether air blows out the loop amplifier evenly. Or is there any part of the loop amplifier that blows more air than another part?</p>
<p>Ideally, air should evenly leave your Dyson heater.</p>
<p>You can also unmount the loop amplifier and turn your Dyson heater on. Listen and feel how much air the fan blows. Then mount the loop amplifier again and compare whether anything changes.</p>
<p>Does the fan sound any different now? Does it still blow the same amount of air? If the airflow changes after mounting the loop amplifier, the airways inside the loop amplifier are likely blocked.</p>
<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> Unmount the loop amplifier and dry brush the slit. Brush a toothbrush along the opening of the loop amplifier.</p>
<p>Mount the loop amplifier again and start your Dyson heater. Does the airflow improve?</p>
<p><img alt="dyson loop amplifier" loading="lazy" src="/img/dyson-loop-amplifier.webp"></p>
<h3 id="replace-or-remove-the-air-filter">Replace or remove the air filter<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#replace-or-remove-the-air-filter">#</a></h3>
<p>All air in a Dyson heater passes through the air filter. Your heater’s air filter is another spot where dirt and dust accumulate and block proper airflow.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should replace your air filters every 12 months (at least, according to Dyson). If you don’t do that, or you were not even aware of that, then obstructed air filters are a likely problem.</p>
<p><strong>How to test:</strong> Open your Dyson heater and remove the air filters. You can check your manual for how to do it with your specific heater model. Every model is slightly different.</p>
<p>Usually, it’s a simple lifting of the loop amplifier and then just removing the case parts with the air inlet holes. Then, you can directly access the air filters.</p>
<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> If your air filters are clogged you can do three different things. All of them will improve the airflow, but only one is a solution Dyson likes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace the air filter</li>
<li>Clean the air filter</li>
<li>Remove the air filter</li>
</ul>
<p>Guess which one Dyson prefers? Right, the first one.</p>
<p>Replacing the air filters is usually the best option since it fixes your airflow problem and it improves the air quality.</p>
<p>However, if you are short on cash or you want to fix your Dyson heater <em>now</em>, you can just dry-brush the excess dirt using a toothbrush. This will not get rid of all the fine dust particles.</p>
<p>But it might be enough to unclog your heater for proper airflow again.</p>
<p>The third option is to remove the air filter entirely. Now, this is highly discouraged by Dyson as it voids your warranty. Dyson claims that this can damage your heater’s internals.</p>
<p>But I think removing the air filters is just fine for a quick check of whether the air filter is your problem or not.</p>
<p><strong>If your Dyson heater blows hot air when running it without a filter, you can tell for sure that the air filter is the cause of the problem.</strong></p>
<p>That’s it. The airway-cleaning tips we just covered will get 95% of Dyson heaters working again. Make sure you follow them closely and I am sure your Dyson heater will work just fine.</p>
<p>If your heater still does not blow hot air, here’s what else you should check.</p>
<h3 id="set-a-target-temperature-above-room-temperature">Set a target temperature above room temperature<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#set-a-target-temperature-above-room-temperature">#</a></h3>
<p>Dyson heaters have a built-in thermostat. On the front panel of your Dyson heater, you can set the target temperature of your room. That’s the temperature you want your room to be.</p>
<p>The target temperature is not the temperature of the air coming out of your heater. That’s a common misconception.</p>
<p>If the target temperature is below room temperature, the heater won’t turn on.</p>
<p><strong>How to test:</strong> Set your Dyson heater to the highest setting (99°F / 37°C) and see if it heats.</p>
<p>If your Dyson heater starts heating now, but not at your desired target temperature, this simply means that the target temperature is likely below the current room temperature.</p>
<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> There’s no fix for this. If you want your Dyson heater to blow hot air, increase the target temperature setting on the front panel.</p>
<p>It should be working then.</p>
<h3 id="wait-for-the-dyson-heater-to-heat-up">Wait for the Dyson heater to heat up<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#wait-for-the-dyson-heater-to-heat-up">#</a></h3>
<p>After turning on your Dyson heater, it does not immediately blow how air. Most Dyson heaters need around 1 minute to start the heating after turning on.</p>
<p>And additionally, the heating elements which are located on either side of the loop amplifier turn on one at a time. This causes the heater to blow hot air on one side of the loop amplifier before the other side starts getting warm.</p>
<p>I have no idea what the technical reason for this might be. It might have something to do with the control algorithm of the thermostat. Or it could reduce tension in the plastic case from sudden heating.</p>
<p><strong>How to test</strong>: Run your Dyson heater for more than a minute. Does it get warm now?</p>
<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> Unfortunately, there is no fix for this. Dyson heaters (and almost all other kinds of heaters) need time to heat up.</p>
<p>You just need to be more patient.</p>
<h3 id="fix-blown-or-broken-parts-in-the-electronic-circuitry">Fix blown or broken parts in the electronic circuitry<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fix-blown-or-broken-parts-in-the-electronic-circuitry">#</a></h3>
<p>It could also be that your Dyson heater has an internal electronic issue. It could be that the power module does not deliver enough power to run the heating elements.</p>
<p>Or it could be that the thermostat’s thermometer is broken and returns wrong values to the thermostat (which causes it to think that your room is already at target temperature and needs no heating).</p>
<p><img alt="power module" loading="lazy" src="/img/portable-ac-power-module.webp"></p>
<p><strong>How to test:</strong> This one is a little advanced, but it should be doable for everyone who likes to repair electronics.</p>
<p>Open the Dyson heater’s case until you see the electronic circuitry. I find the simplest way to inspect electronics is to just look at all the parts.</p>
<p>Use a flashlight and a magnifying glass to check all of the small resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits.</p>
<p>Are there burn marks around any of the parts? Is a connection of any part broken? Is a component hovering a tenth of a millimeter above a connection without actually touching it? (Yes, I’ve seen all of these things).</p>
<p>If you find something, note the part number (if there is any), or try to find online what part it is.</p>
<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> Get a replacement part. Replace the broken part with your replacement. Likely, you will have to use a soldering iron. Use plenty of flux to make a good connection.</p>
<p>Run your Dyson heater and see if it starts blowing hot air now.</p>
<p>If you find an issue and you know which part is broken, but you can’t properly fix it yourself, you can ask an electrician (or maybe a family member who knows how to solder) to do it for you.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-if-your-dyson-heater-is-still-not-heating">What to do if your Dyson heater is still not heating?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-to-do-if-your-dyson-heater-is-still-not-heating">#</a></h2>
<p>If you follow all of the above steps your Dyson heater <em>should</em> be heating.</p>
<p>But if yours still does not, I’d recommend just getting a new heater. My personal recommendation would be <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Pure-Cool-Purifier-Heater/dp/B07KXPXN5T?crid=3KAFFMQTLIMRC&amp;keywords=dyson+hot+cool&amp;qid=1670931534&amp;sprefix=dyson+hot+cool%2Caps%2C176&amp;sr=8-2&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;linkId=bdd0484ea293d94440524fcdb4b877f6&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">this <strong>Dyson Hot + Coo</strong> l (click here to view it on amazon)</a>.</p>
<p>This one is a perfectly good 1,500W Dyson heater.</p>
<p>There’s just one more thing I have to say before you splurge on another Dyson product.</p>
<p>Get a Dyson only if you really enjoyed your current model. Similar to Apple products, Dyson is a brand that values design, quality, and user experience a lot.</p>
<p>But you have to pay a high price for that.</p>
<p>So, only get a Dyson heater if it’s truly worth it for you.</p>
<p>Design, quality, and user experience are perfectly valid buying justifications. Just like many people prefer luxury cars over cheaper cars with the same horsepower.</p>
<p>If, however, you only need a heat source, and you don’t really care about the design of the heater, then you should get a regular oil-filled radiator, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PELONIS-Programmable-Thermostat-Overheating-Functions/dp/B07XRP9M3F?keywords=pelonis+oil+filled+radiator+heater&amp;qid=1670931926&amp;sprefix=pelonis+oil%2Caps%2C182&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;linkId=ca64b08577205da3dca8879cefb5ad86&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">this <strong>Pelonis oil-filled radiator</strong> (click here to view it on amazon).</a></p>
<p>This oil-filled radiator produces the exact same amount of heat as the Dyson Hot + Cool, but it’s a lot cheaper.</p>
<p>It’s my personal favorite electric heater, so I am a bit biased. Here’s my <a href="/recommended-products/oil-filled-radiator/">review</a>.</p>
<p>Dyson claims that their heaters are more efficient than conventional space heaters. But that is factually not the case. I’ve written an extensive article about <a href="/are-dyson-heaters-energy-efficient-a-critical-review/">why Dyson heaters can’t be more efficient than other space heaters</a>.</p>
<p>Check this one out! It will improve your understanding of Dyson’s marketing claims and whether they can withstand fact-checks.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>You can fix almost any Dyson heater not blowing hot air by cleaning clogged airways. Dust, dirt, and moisture are the most common cause of air not being able to move inside your heater.</p>
<p>I’d say if you follow this article closely, you are guaranteed to find a fix for your problem!</p>
<p>Even if you decide to buy a new Dyson heater in the end, you always know which issues to look out for.</p>
<p>Now you know that you have to maintain Dyson’s airways frequently. When your heater’s airways are blocked, you can quickly check and fix it!</p>
<p>I hope I could help you resolve your problem. If you still have a question, or if your heater had another problem that’s not listed in this article, then please shoot me a mail!</p>
<p>I’d love to include your solutions as well!</p>
