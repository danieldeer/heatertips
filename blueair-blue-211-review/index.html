But does its size benefit you?\nOr are smaller models such as the 311 or 411 just as good?\nAlso, how does the Blueair Blue keep up with its competition?\nBlueair fiercely competes with Levoit and Coway, two of the most popular air purifier brands.\nIn this article, my goal is to answer all these questions.\nHi, my name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer, and on this blog, my top priority is finding out which heating, cooling, and air quality devices really work.\nQuick answer: The Blueair Blue 211+ is worth it if you prioritize energy efficiency, quiet operation, and a straightforward user experience. However, if you’re looking for advanced features like app controls, voice activation, or larger room coverage, I’d rather get the Levoit Core 600S and Coway Airmega 300S .\nBlueair’s Marketing Strategy: Sizing Air Purifiers In the air purifier market, one prominent sales strategy is to advertise a series of air purifiers, with models of different sizes.\nOne example is Blueair’s Blue series, the one we’re looking at now. But there are plenty of other examples, such as the Levoit Core models or Coway Airmega models.\nAll of these air purifier series have one thing in common:\nThe largest air purifier in a model series is always much more expensive than the average-sized air purifier.\nThe Blueair Blue Pure 211+ is the biggest model on the left-hand side. Next to it are the 311 (middle) and the 411 (right).\nThis generally makes sense. However, oftentimes, the largest model is a whole different price class. Usually, it costs more than double the price of the model right below it in the size hierarchy.\nIn Blueair’s Blue series, the Blueair Blue 211+ costs more than double of what the 311 costs.\nAnd because the largest model is so expensive, the high price makes the smaller models look more reasonable.\nI want to know:\nIs this price justified? Or is it just a price-based marketing strategy to make other Blueair air purifiers look better?\nLet’s find out!\nWhat’s good about the Blueair Blue 211+? First of all, let’s have a look at what the Blueair Blue 211+ (click to view it on amazon) does well.\nAuto Mode I particularly like when air purifiers have a built-in auto mode. It just makes everyday life easier.\nJust plug the Blueair Blue 211+ into a wall outlet and turn on the “auto mode”.\nIn “auto mode” a particle sensor to monitor pollutant levels in the room and adjust the fan speed accordingly.\nIt’s a hands-free way to maintain air quality.\nAlthough, to be very strict: At this price point, any air purifier should have auto mode.\nIt’s a great feature. But it’s also an expected feature. And the Blueair Blue 211+ fulfills its duty here.\nEnergy Efficiency The unit has received an Energy Star rating. On the lowest setting, the Blueair Blue 211+ consumes just 4 Watts of power. That’s less than an LED bulb.\nThat is an absurdly low power consumption. Especially for a device the size of the Blueair Blue 211+.\nBut again, to be realistic: At a 4 Watts power consumption, the Blueair Blue 211+ won’t purify the air much.\nIt produces minimal airflow and minimal noise, which is nice.\nBut personally, I prefer to run air purifiers at appropriate fan speeds. Then I can be sure that all the air in my room is cleaned.\nIt’s a nice gimmicky feature, though. And it shows the quality of the fan and its bearings.\nMany poor-quality fans would not even rotate at 4 Watts of input power.\nFiltration Capability The dual-filtration HEPASilent technology provides faster and quieter cleaning, with claims of removing 99.99% of common allergens and 99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.1 micron in size.\nWhile these high percentages are great, they are required by the HEPA standard. So, they are not unique to the Blueair Blue series.\nDon’t get me wrong:\nThe filters are probably among the best you can get among air purifiers. But the specification is basic.\nOther brands such as Dyson, Coway, and Levoit all filter at least just as well.\nOverall, the Blueair Blue 211+ appears to be a solid, regular air purifier that provides good filtration, quality, and energy efficiency.\nBut I am missing unique features. Any air purifier in this price this price class offers these.\nIn fact, I am even missing some features, such as detailed air quality reports, smart home \u0026 app integration, etc.\nWe’ll have a look at what’s missing later.\nWhat’s not so good about the Blueair Blue 211+? There are even some things about the Blueair Blue 211+ that are not really good. I may be nitpicking here. But, as an engineer, I have to go into the details.\nExposed Washable Pre-filter The “pre-filter” is more a design feature than an actual filter. Yes, it does prevent too-large particles and hair from entering the purifier.\nAnd yes, it increases the HEPA filter’s lifespan.\nSo, in principle, the idea is good.\nBut the implementation is not ideal, in my opinion.\nThe exposed pre-filter is just a regular cloth that covers the lower part of the Blueair Blue’s casing.\nAlthough it is washable it can easily discolor over time.\nI did a search on amazon looking for replacement pre-filters. And there are dozens of results, some approximating a thousand reviews. This shows me that prefilters easily get damaged or permanently discolored and people are forced to get replacements.\nAnd on top of that, this pre-filter can increase airflow resistance, thereby reducing the unit’s efficiency.\nSo, what’s a better way to do it?\nInstead of exposing a piece of cloth, I’d rather use an internal fine-meshed non-cloth pre-filter that sits right in front of the actual HEPA filter. Many Coway Airmega models have that.\nIn those air purifiers, there is nothing that can discolor and needs replacement, and the pre-filter lasts for decades because it is protected inside the case.\nLacking air quality monitoring If I pay several hundreds of dollars for an air purifier, I want it to be exceptionally good in all realms of air purifier features.\nThe Blueair Blue 211+ provides a single indicator light with 3 color levels: Blue (good air quality), Yellow, and Red (poor air quality).\nIn principle, that’s a good thing.\nHowever, the Blueair Blue 211+ uses only a single regular particle sensor to judge air quality.\nThat’s acceptable for air purifiers in the $100 - $200 range.\nBut not for the Blueair Blue 211+.\nFor comparison, Dyson air purifiers provide a whole set of air quality sensors, including two different particle sensors, and two gas sensors.\nSo, they can even detect odors and unhealthy gases.\nWhile the Blueair Blue 211+ is cheaper than a Dyson air purifier, I would still love it a lot more if it provided better air quality reports.\nThe small blue indicator light indicates air quality.\nCost The Blueair Blue Pure 211+ currently costs twice as much as the Blueair Blue Pure 311, which is the smaller model in the series.\nBut it offers no more features.\nAnd the area coverage is merely 41% higher (550 sq. ft. instead of 388 sq. ft.)\nSo, you pay double to gain only 41%. I’d only pay double to gain double.\nThe pricing is not reasonable. Especially, when you consider that manufacturing cost does not double as well. Likely, it’s just 10% higher.\nIt appears that the Blueair Blue 211+ is indeed just a placeholder product to make the 311 look better.\nIt just doesn’t deliver the bang for your buck.\nAnd, if someone actually buys the 211+, Blueair profits a lot.\nComparison: Blueair Blue 211+ vs. Levoit Core 600S vs. Coway Airmega 300S So, we’ve looked at what’s good and bad about the Blueair Blue 211+. But how does it stack up against its key rivals—Levoit Core 600S and Coway Airmega 300S?\nThe quick answer: The Blueair Blue 211+ just can’t keep up.\nCheck out the other air purifiers here:\nLevoit Core 600S (click to view it on amazon) Coway Airmega 300S (click to view it on amazon) Let’s dive in.\nThe Coway Airmega 300S.\nApp \u0026 Voice Controls Starting with features, Coway Airmega 300S is a show-stealer.\nWith advanced voice control options, an app interface, and superior air quality monitoring, it’s packed to the brim.\nThe Levoit Core 600S provides state-of-the-art features as well; it has a detailed air quality report system, including a comparison of outdoor and indoor pollution, an app \u0026 voice controls.\nThe Blueair Blue 211+, on the other hand, is pretty basic. It has no voice control, no app, and basic air quality indicators. It leaves me asking: Where are the extras that should come with the price?\nI personally, don’t need voice controls and an app at all. To me, they are just fancy add-ons. And, in my opinion, not everything needs to be voice controllable nowadays.\nBut still, the lack of features shows that the Blueair Blue 211+ can’t keep up with other brands.\nFiltration \u0026 Energy Efficiency Filtration-wise, all three models are close competitors. They all meet the HEPA standard, which is excellent but expected.\nOn the energy consumption front, the Blueair Blue 211+ beats the competition with its 4 Watts power consumption on the lowest setting.\nCoway Airmega 300S is also Energy Star rated but doesn’t hit the low figures of the Blueair. The Levoit also can’t hit these low wattages.\nThis doesn’t mean that Blueair is more efficient than Coway and Levoit. It merely means it can run on lower power settings. And accordingly, it is quieter.\nThe Blueair Blue 211+ is great for nighttime operations, studying, and work.\nBut overall, the difference is small. All good quality air purifiers are energy-efficient. The differences are negligible.\nRoom Coverage In terms of room coverage, Levoit Core 600S is the king, covering up to a massive 3,175 sq ft. Coway Airmega 300S covers less area but still beats the Blueair’s 550 sq ft.\nThe Levoit Core 600S allegedly covers the largest area (by far)\nThe significant area coverage difference can be explained by different types of experiments performed by different brands. It could be that Blueair is just more honest than Levoit.\nAnd I personally trust the accuracy of Blueair’s 550 sq. ft. rating more than Levoit’s \u003e3,000 sq. ft. rating.\nBut still, the Blueway Blue 211+ can’t technically beat the Levoit Core and Coway Airmega models in area coverage, because the pre-filter cloth blocks airflow.\nThat’s why I described it as a design flaw earlier.\nAnd remember, the Blueair Blue 211+ costs twice as much as its smaller sibling, the 311, for just 41% more coverage. That’s not the best deal if you ask me.\nTop 3 Reasons to Buy the Blueair Blue 211+ Energy Efficiency The Blueair Blue 211+ is notably energy-efficient, running at just 4 Watts on its lowest setting. If you’re concerned about reducing your carbon footprint or simply want to save on your electricity bill, this unit offers a compelling advantage over its rivals like the Levoit Core 600S and Coway Airmega 300S.\nQuiet Operation Another benefit of its low power consumption is the unit’s quiet operation. If you need an air purifier for spaces where silence is golden—such as bedrooms, study rooms, or nurseries—the Blueair Blue 211+ is an excellent choice for peaceful, uninterrupted air purification.\nSimplified User Experience While it may lack the advanced features of its competitors, the Blueair Blue 211+ offers a straightforward, easy-to-use interface. If you find voice controls and app integrations to be unnecessary complications, you’ll appreciate the no-frills approach of this model, allowing you to focus on what really matters: clean air.\nIn summary, the Blueair Blue 211+ may not be as feature-rich as its competitors, but it shines in energy efficiency, quiet operation, and user simplicity—qualities that could make it the ideal choice for your specific needs.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>The Blueair Blue 211+ is the largest air purifier in Blueair’s Blue series. But does its size benefit you?</p>
<p>Or are smaller models such as the 311 or 411 just as good?</p>
<p>Also, how does the Blueair Blue keep up with its competition?</p>
<p>Blueair fiercely competes with Levoit and Coway, two of the most popular air purifier brands.</p>
<p>In this article, my goal is to answer all these questions.</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer, and on this blog, my top priority is finding out which heating, cooling, and air quality devices <em>really work.</em></p>
<p>Quick answer: <strong>The</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HEPASilent-Purifier-2640sqft-Allergens-Pre-Filter/dp/B08LQQKD8B?crid=1G5WEM85BKY8M&amp;keywords=blueair%2B211%2B&amp;qid=1694331569&amp;sprefix=blueair%2B211%2Caps%2C170&amp;sr=8-3&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;linkId=0cae12871bcc0c50d459bb0e4a497d73&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><strong>Blueair Blue 211+</strong></a> <strong>is worth it if you prioritize energy efficiency, quiet operation, and a straightforward user experience. However, if you&rsquo;re looking for advanced features like app controls, voice activation, or larger room coverage, I’d rather get the</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEVOIT-Purifier-Allergies-Core-400S/dp/B09BJMY8HL?crid=KGO6U8JXB8CC&amp;keywords=levoit%2Bcore%2B600s&amp;qid=1694333181&amp;sprefix=levoit%2Bcore%2B600%2Caps%2C174&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;linkId=e8fe3dea70f67589d79358809e19297e&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><strong>Levoit Core 600S</strong></a> <strong>and</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coway-Airmega-Purifier-sq-tf-White/dp/B01C9RIARQ?crid=17YFDJZP9125K&amp;keywords=airmega%2B300s&amp;qid=1694333288&amp;sprefix=airmega%2B300%2Caps%2C169&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;linkId=ed836cd0df00cd5fbe6ac5715eed80cd&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><strong>Coway Airmega 300S</strong></a> <strong>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="blueairs-marketing-strategy-sizing-air-purifiers">Blueair’s Marketing Strategy: Sizing Air Purifiers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#blueairs-marketing-strategy-sizing-air-purifiers">#</a></h2>
<p>In the air purifier market, one prominent sales strategy is to advertise a series of air purifiers, with models of different sizes.</p>
<p>One example is Blueair’s Blue series, the one we’re looking at now. But there are plenty of other examples, such as the <a href="/best-air-purifier/">Levoit Core models</a> or <a href="/are-coway-airmega-air-purifiers-worth-it/">Coway Airmega</a> models.</p>
<p>All of these air purifier series have one thing in common:</p>
<p><strong>The largest air purifier in a model series is always much more expensive than the average-sized air purifier.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="blueair blue pure 211 311 411 compared" loading="lazy" src="/img/blueair-blue-pure-211-311-411-compared.webp">The Blueair Blue Pure 211+ is the biggest model on the left-hand side. Next to it are the 311 (middle) and the 411 (right).</p>
<p>This generally makes sense. However, oftentimes, the largest model is a whole different price class. Usually, it costs more than <em>double</em> the price of the model right below it in the size hierarchy.</p>
<p>In Blueair’s Blue series, <strong>the Blueair Blue 211+ costs more than double of what the 311 costs.</strong></p>
<p>And because the largest model is so expensive, the high price makes the smaller models <em>look</em> more reasonable.</p>
<p>I want to know:</p>
<p><strong>Is this price justified? Or is it just a price-based marketing strategy to make other Blueair air purifiers look better?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s find out!</p>
<h2 id="whats-good-about-the-blueair-blue-211">What’s good about the Blueair Blue 211+?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#whats-good-about-the-blueair-blue-211">#</a></h2>
<p>First of all, let’s have a look at what the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HEPASilent-Purifier-2640sqft-Allergens-Pre-Filter/dp/B08LQQKD8B?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=28jmO&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.952cfb50-b01e-485f-be6e-00434541418b%3Aamzn1.symc.e5c80209-769f-4ade-a325-2eaec14b8e0e&amp;pf_rd_p=952cfb50-b01e-485f-be6e-00434541418b&amp;pf_rd_r=EVYAMHDJ7KPAGGSAGTZF&amp;pd_rd_wg=FNH2o&amp;pd_rd_r=f0e6a1be-67ad-4946-8d8e-79089a9a57e2&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;linkId=15ce8a20b90c7627c2e6e3baeb6945c1&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><strong>Blueair Blue 211+</strong> (click to view it on amazon)</a> does well.</p>
<h3 id="auto-mode">Auto Mode<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#auto-mode">#</a></h3>
<p>I particularly like when air purifiers have a built-in auto mode. It just makes everyday life easier.</p>
<p>Just plug the Blueair Blue 211+ into a wall outlet and turn on the “auto mode”.</p>
<p>In “auto mode” a particle sensor to monitor pollutant levels in the room and adjust the fan speed accordingly.</p>
<p>It’s a hands-free way to maintain air quality.</p>
<p>Although, to be very strict: At this price point, any air purifier should have auto mode.</p>
<p>It’s a great feature. But it’s also an <em>expected</em> feature. And the Blueair Blue 211+ fulfills its duty here.</p>
<h3 id="energy-efficiency">Energy Efficiency<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#energy-efficiency">#</a></h3>
<p>The unit has received an Energy Star rating. On the lowest setting, the Blueair Blue 211+ consumes just 4 Watts of power. That’s less than an LED bulb.</p>
<p>That is an absurdly low power consumption. Especially for a device the size of the Blueair Blue 211+.</p>
<p>But again, to be realistic: At a 4 Watts power consumption, the Blueair Blue 211+ won’t purify the air much.</p>
<p>It produces minimal airflow and minimal noise, which is nice.</p>
<p>But personally, I prefer to run air purifiers at appropriate fan speeds. Then I can be sure that all the air in my room is cleaned.</p>
<p>It’s a nice gimmicky feature, though. And it shows the quality of the fan and its bearings.</p>
<p>Many poor-quality fans would not even rotate at 4 Watts of input power.</p>
<h3 id="filtration-capability">Filtration Capability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#filtration-capability">#</a></h3>
<p>The dual-filtration HEPASilent technology provides faster and quieter cleaning, with claims of removing 99.99% of common allergens and 99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.1 micron in size.</p>
<p>While these high percentages are great, they are required by the HEPA standard. So, they are not unique to the Blueair Blue series.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong:</p>
<p>The filters are probably among the best you can get among air purifiers. But the specification is basic.</p>
<p>Other brands such as Dyson, Coway, and Levoit all filter <em>at least</em> just as well.</p>
<p>Overall, <strong>the Blueair Blue 211+ appears to be a solid, regular air purifier that provides good filtration, quality, and energy efficiency.</strong></p>
<p>But I am <strong>missing</strong> <strong><em>unique</em></strong> <strong>features</strong>. Any air purifier in this price this price class offers these.</p>
<p>In fact, I am even missing some features, such as detailed air quality reports, smart home &amp; app integration, etc.</p>
<p>We’ll have a look at what’s missing later.</p>
<p><img alt="blueair blue pure 211 standing in living room" loading="lazy" src="/img/blueair-blue-pure-211-standing-in-living-room.webp"></p>
<h2 id="whats-not-so-good-about-the-blueair-blue-211">What’s not so good about the Blueair Blue 211+?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#whats-not-so-good-about-the-blueair-blue-211">#</a></h2>
<p>There are even some things about the Blueair Blue 211+ that are not really good. I may be nitpicking here. But, as an engineer, I have to go into the details.</p>
<h3 id="exposed-washable-pre-filter">Exposed Washable Pre-filter<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exposed-washable-pre-filter">#</a></h3>
<p>The “pre-filter” is more a design feature than an actual filter. Yes, it does prevent too-large particles and hair from entering the purifier.</p>
<p>And yes, it increases the <a href="/can-you-run-air-purifier-all-day/">HEPA filter’s lifespan</a>.</p>
<p>So, in principle, the idea is good.</p>
<p>But the implementation is not ideal, in my opinion.</p>
<p>The exposed pre-filter is just a regular cloth that covers the lower part of the Blueair Blue’s casing.</p>
<p>Although it is washable it can easily discolor over time.</p>
<p>I did a search on amazon looking for replacement pre-filters. And there are dozens of results, some approximating a thousand reviews. This shows me that <strong>prefilters easily get damaged or permanently discolored</strong> and people are forced to get replacements.</p>
<p>And on top of that, this pre-filter can <strong>increase airflow resistance</strong>, thereby reducing the unit’s efficiency.</p>
<p>So, what’s a better way to do it?</p>
<p>Instead of exposing a piece of cloth, I’d rather use an internal fine-meshed non-cloth pre-filter that sits right in front of the actual HEPA filter. Many Coway Airmega models have that.</p>
<p>In those air purifiers, there is nothing that can discolor and needs replacement, and the pre-filter lasts for <em>decades</em> because it is protected inside the case.</p>
<h3 id="lacking-air-quality-monitoring">Lacking air quality monitoring<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#lacking-air-quality-monitoring">#</a></h3>
<p>If I pay several hundreds of dollars for an air purifier, I want it to be <em>exceptionally</em> good in all realms of air purifier features.</p>
<p>The Blueair Blue 211+ provides a single indicator light with 3 color levels: Blue (good air quality), Yellow, and Red (poor air quality).</p>
<p>In principle, that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>However, the Blueair Blue 211+ uses only a <em>single regular particle sensor</em> to judge air quality.</p>
<p>That’s acceptable for air purifiers in the $100 - $200 range.</p>
<p>But not for the Blueair Blue 211+.</p>
<p>For comparison, <a href="/are-dyson-air-purifiers-worth-the-money/">Dyson air purifiers provide a whole set of air quality sensors</a>, including two different particle sensors, and two gas sensors.</p>
<p>So, they can even detect odors and unhealthy gases.</p>
<p>While the Blueair Blue 211+ is cheaper than a Dyson air purifier, I would still love it a lot more if it provided better air quality reports.</p>
<p><img alt="blueair blue pure 211 closeup" loading="lazy" src="/img/blueair-blue-pure-211-closeup.webp">The small blue indicator light indicates air quality.</p>
<h3 id="cost">Cost<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cost">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Blueair Blue Pure 211+ currently costs twice as much as the Blueair Blue Pure 311</strong>, which is the smaller model in the series.</p>
<p>But it offers no more features.</p>
<p>And the <strong>area coverage is merely 41% higher</strong> (550 sq. ft. instead of 388 sq. ft.)</p>
<p>So, you pay double to gain only 41%. I’d only pay double to gain double.</p>
<p>The pricing is not reasonable. <em>Especially</em>, when you consider that manufacturing cost does not double as well. Likely, it’s just 10% higher.</p>
<p>It appears that the Blueair Blue 211+ is indeed just a placeholder product to make the 311 look better.</p>
<p>It just doesn’t deliver the bang for your buck.</p>
<p>And, if someone actually buys the 211+, Blueair profits a lot.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-blueair-blue-211-vs-levoit-core-600s-vs-coway-airmega-300s">Comparison: Blueair Blue 211+ vs. Levoit Core 600S vs. Coway Airmega 300S<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#comparison-blueair-blue-211-vs-levoit-core-600s-vs-coway-airmega-300s">#</a></h2>
<p>So, we’ve looked at what’s good and bad about the Blueair Blue 211+. But how does it stack up against its key rivals—Levoit Core 600S and Coway Airmega 300S?</p>
<p>The quick answer: <strong>The Blueair Blue 211+ just can’t keep up.</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>Let’s dive in.</p>
<p><img alt="coway airmega 400 product image" loading="lazy" src="/img/coway-airmega-400-product-image.webp">The Coway Airmega 300S.</p>
<h3 id="app--voice-controls"><strong>App &amp; Voice Controls</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#app--voice-controls">#</a></h3>
<p>Starting with features, Coway Airmega 300S is a show-stealer.</p>
<p>With advanced voice control options, an app interface, and superior air quality monitoring, it’s packed to the brim.</p>
<p>The Levoit Core 600S provides state-of-the-art features as well; it has a detailed air quality report system, including a comparison of outdoor and indoor pollution, an app &amp; voice controls.</p>
<p>The Blueair Blue 211+, on the other hand, is pretty basic. It has no voice control, no app, and basic air quality indicators. It leaves me asking: Where are the extras that should come with the price?</p>
<p>I personally, don’t need voice controls and an app at all. To me, they are just fancy add-ons. And, in my opinion, not everything needs to be voice controllable nowadays.</p>
<p>But still, the lack of features shows that the Blueair Blue 211+ can’t keep up with other brands.</p>
<h3 id="filtration--energy-efficiency">Filtration &amp; Energy Efficiency<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#filtration--energy-efficiency">#</a></h3>
<p>Filtration-wise, all three models are close competitors. They all meet the HEPA standard, which is excellent but expected.</p>
<p>On the energy consumption front, <strong>the Blueair Blue 211+ beats the competition with its 4 Watts power consumption on the lowest setting.</strong></p>
<p>Coway Airmega 300S is also Energy Star rated but doesn’t hit the low figures of the Blueair. The Levoit also can’t hit these low wattages.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that Blueair is more efficient than Coway and Levoit. It merely means <strong>it can run on lower power settings</strong>. And accordingly, it is <strong>quieter</strong>.<br>
<strong>The Blueair Blue 211+ is great for nighttime operations, studying, and work.</strong></p>
<p>But overall, the difference is small. <a href="/air-purifier-running-cost-guide/">All good quality air purifiers are energy-efficient</a>. The differences are negligible.</p>
<h3 id="room-coverage">Room Coverage<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#room-coverage">#</a></h3>
<p>In terms of room coverage, Levoit Core 600S is the king, covering up to a massive 3,175 sq ft. Coway Airmega 300S covers less area but still beats the Blueair’s 550 sq ft.</p>
<p><img alt="levoit core 600s product image" loading="lazy" src="/img/levoit-core-600s-product-image.webp">The Levoit Core 600S allegedly covers the largest area (by far)</p>
<p>The significant area coverage difference can be explained by different types of experiments performed by different brands. It <em>could</em> be that Blueair is just more honest than Levoit.</p>
<p>And I personally trust the accuracy of Blueair’s 550 sq. ft. rating more than Levoit’s &gt;3,000 sq. ft. rating.</p>
<p>But still, <strong>the Blueway Blue 211+ can’t technically beat the Levoit Core and Coway Airmega models in area coverage, because the pre-filter cloth blocks airflow.</strong></p>
<p>That’s why I described it as a design flaw earlier.</p>
<p>And remember, the Blueair Blue 211+ costs <em>twice</em> as much as its smaller sibling, the 311, for just 41% more coverage. That’s not the best deal if you ask me.</p>
<h2 id="top-3-reasons-to-buy-the-blueair-blue-211">Top 3 Reasons to Buy the Blueair Blue 211+<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#top-3-reasons-to-buy-the-blueair-blue-211">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="energy-efficiency-1">Energy Efficiency<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#energy-efficiency-1">#</a></h3>
<p>The Blueair Blue 211+ is notably energy-efficient, running at just 4 Watts on its lowest setting. If you’re concerned about reducing your carbon footprint or simply want to save on your electricity bill, this unit offers a compelling advantage over its rivals like the Levoit Core 600S and Coway Airmega 300S.</p>
<h3 id="quiet-operation">Quiet Operation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#quiet-operation">#</a></h3>
<p>Another benefit of its low power consumption is the unit’s quiet operation. If you need an air purifier for spaces where silence is golden—such as bedrooms, study rooms, or nurseries—the Blueair Blue 211+ is an excellent choice for peaceful, uninterrupted air purification.</p>
<h3 id="simplified-user-experience">Simplified User Experience<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#simplified-user-experience">#</a></h3>
<p>While it may lack the advanced features of its competitors, the Blueair Blue 211+ offers a straightforward, easy-to-use interface. If you find voice controls and app integrations to be unnecessary complications, you’ll appreciate the no-frills approach of this model, allowing you to focus on what really matters: clean air.</p>
<p>In summary, <strong>the Blueair Blue 211+ may not be as feature-rich as its competitors, but it shines in energy efficiency, quiet operation, and user simplicity</strong>—qualities that could make it the ideal choice for your specific needs.</p>
