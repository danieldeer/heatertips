      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are there any space heaters with long cords? I just had to answer this question, when I noticed that my space heater cord isn’t long enough to place my heater anywhere I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To find the space heater with the longest cords, I’ve researched for hours, browsing through product descriptions and manuals to find the lengths of the cords of dozens of space heaters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was pretty difficult to get the values. It seems like companies try to hide the cord length on purpose. But why?&lt;br&gt;
What I found was surprising. Keep reading to find out!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
