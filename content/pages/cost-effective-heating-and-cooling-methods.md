On HeaterTips, you get **honest, cost-effective, and technically solid recommendations** on heating and cooling your home!

Hi, my name is Daniel. Everything you read on this page is backed by my **own experiments** which I perform in my **home lab**, studies, and my own experience using heaters, air conditioners, and air purifiers.

I don't care about product brands, marketing, design, and all of that stuff. I just recommend what works and what is reasonable for you.

Hi there, my name is Daniel. I am a 27-year-old electrical engineer (who graduated with a M.Sc. from TU Darmstadt / Germany), whose home is stuffed with heaters. Whenever someone visits I get a comment on what is going on here! Aside from writing about home heating and other electrical stuff, I enjoy biking, running, and climbing - anything that gets me out the door. Maybe I'll make a website about that as well one day.
