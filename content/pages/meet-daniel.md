I am Daniel, a 27-year-old electrical engineer (working as a [Software Engineer in the space industry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hirsch-daniel/)). I have a loving girlfriend and enjoy being out in nature, going on runs, cycling, or even climbing. Although, I do the latter way to rarely.

I've been blogging about home heating and air conditioning on this website since 2019 now. There have been many emotional ups and downs. Sustaining a website in the age of AI is certainly a challenge. But since writing became a daily habit for me, I view heatertips as a passion project.
