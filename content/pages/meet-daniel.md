Hi, I am Daniel, an electrical engineer. For heatertips.com I research cost-effective heating and air conditioning methods, debunk myths, and explain what really works.

I've been blogging about home heating and air conditioning on this website since 2019 now. There have been many emotional ups and downs. Sustaining a website in the age of AI is certainly a challenge. But since writing became a daily habit for me, I view heatertips as a passion project.

The biggest difference between this website and many others is that I try to keep it simple & effective. I _never_ recommend overpriced products. And I tell you what _really_ works. At least to my best knowledge. I confirm everything I write through experiment and personal experience.
And since I studied electrical engineering, I think I know much of the theory as well.

If you ever find any errors on this website, please reach out to me! Any corrections are more than welcome.
