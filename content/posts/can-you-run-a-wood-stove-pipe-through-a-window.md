Can you run a wood stove pipe through a window?

A wood stove pipe connects the chimney to the stove, and it's meant to exhaust fumes out of your home. But what if your house or RV doesn't have a chimney?

Quick answer: **Yes, you can run a wood stove pipe through a window by using a pre-made window plate kit or making one yourself using double-walled metal pipes and a metal sheet to cover the window space. Ensure the pipe is angled upwards and lifted above the roof to increase efficiency.**

Getting the proper materials and a safe installation plan is vital. Letâ€™s look at the steps.

## How to Run a Wood Stove Pipe through a Window

There are two ways to run a wood stove pipe through a window:

- either you buy a pre-constructed window plate kit (a bit expensive)
- or you build your own window kit (more fun, better quality and you save money)

### Buy a pre-made wood stove pipe kit

The easiest way to run a wood stove pipe through the window is to get a ready-made window plate kit because it comes with all the necessary parts.

This specific [window plate kit](https://www.cylinderstoves.com/window-plate-kit.html) from Cylinder Stoves comes with a galvanized 5" wall plate that goes directly on your window (opened), and it already has a hole cut into it for the pipe. It also includes one 5" elbow for the stove and a 6" elbow for the top of the stove pipe.

### Build your own window setup

That said, you can make all this for yourself using a triple-walled pipe and a sheet metal for the window. You can also buy the elbows or connectors to ensure the pipes join together securely.

You will also need a step ladder, jigsaw, drill, safety glasses, construction adhesive, and a screw tip attachment.

### How to install a wood stove pipe window kit

If you have your materials ready, here is the step-by-step process of making a wood stove chimney through a window. These steps assume you have the window kit above so you don't have to drill a hole or measure a metal sheet.

- Open the window just enough to easily fit the metal sheet. Again, a pre-made kit takes the guesswork out of how much room you need on the window; otherwise, you have to make that decision yourself.
- Attach one elbow temporarily onto the end of the long chimney pipe and fit the other end of the pipe onto the stove's exhaust opening at the back or top. Some kits require a pipe joint to join the two parts, but others do not.
- Use sheet metal screws and sealant to secure that first connection and make it airtight.
- Run the pipe out the window, ensuring it's angled upward at a 45-degree angle.
- Place the metal sheet in the window space while inserting the pipe through the hole. Use duct tape to seal the seams between the window and the metal sheet to keep cold air from getting into the house.
- Attach the second part of the pipe to the outside elbow, allowing it to go up above your roof. Sometimes you may need to use two connected pipes depending on your roof's height.
- Ensure you have sealed all the connections using a self-tapping screw and sealant/adhesive.
- Anchor the outside chimney pipe securely at a safe distance from the wall (12-24 inches).
- At the top end of the stove pipe, add a chimney cap to keep the wind from blowing fumes back into the pipe.
- Add a metal sheet on the wall just behind the stove to protect your wall from direct stove heat.

## Is Running a Wood Stove Pipe through a Window Safe?

When done right, running a wood stove pipe through a window is usually safe. But with [U.S. Fire Administration](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-02/documents/wood_smoke_awareness_kit.pdf) terming wood stoves as the most common cause of residential fires, you have to take every precaution to ensure the wooden stove doesn't cause a fire or blow carbon monoxide fumes into your home.

Some preventive measures here include;

- Keeping the wooden stove 12-36 inches away from the window. This will protect the window panes from cracking due to heat and also ensure your curtains or walls are not too close to the fire.
- Only use double or triple-walled pipes and seal them well when running the stove pipe through a window.
- Have a non-flammable platform, such as bricks below the stove's legs to protect the floor.
- Have proper ventilation in your home, and only use seasoned wood to make a fire.
- Place a metal sheet on the wall behind the wood stove to keep heat away from the walls.
- Clean the wood stove and the stove pipes regularly when in use. You can use a long brush to get the creosote off the pipes every couple of weeks.
- Have carbon monoxide detectors and a fire extinguisher nearby just in case.

## Where Else Can You install your Wood Stove Pipe?

While running a wood stove pipe through a window is the easiest choice if you don't have a chimney, there are other ways. You have a few options for venting your wood stove if you have the right tools and know-how.

### Roof

Running a wood stove pipe through the roof is really the best way to vent the stove because the pipe goes straight up without any bends or angles. However, it can be a bit costly since you have to go through the ceiling and roof. You will require a ceiling collar, roof flashing, and of course a hole where the pipe will go through. Ensure the stove pipe extends 3 feet above the roof and has a chimney cap for efficiency.

### Wall

Venting through the roof is similar to doing it through a window. It may require a horizontal pipe going from the stove to the wall. You must also drill a hole through the wall and insulate the pipe to reduce fire hazards.

I recommend hiring a professional to cut the hole and help with the installation to save yourself the trouble. But you can, of course, also do it yourself.

The window plate kit will also work with wall venting, and you can follow all the steps of running a stove pipe through a window. More importantly, ensure you place a metal sheet between the stove and the wall, and don't place the stove too close to the wall.

## Conclusion

A wood stove is the most [cost-effective method to heat a house in winter without electricity](/how-to-heat-room-without-electricity/). But if your house doesn't have a chimney to vent it, running the stove pipes through a window is a great option.

Choose a venting kit with few bends for safe and efficient operation and clean the pipes regularly. Straight, clean chimneys have a better draft which encourages the fire to burn better.
