## **What Is a Ventless Propane Heater?**

**A ventless propane heater, also known as the ‘ _blue flame heater,’_ is a type of space heater that uses propane fuel to heat a room without needing a chimney or other ventilation system. It uses propane and oxygen to generate heat.**

Propane is a highly efficient and clean burning fuel source, making it an ideal choice for indoor heating. Unlike traditional gas heaters, ventless propane heaters do not require an external vent or chimney to operate safely.

These heaters are typically installed in a room or area that does not have access to a chimney or other ventilation systems, such as a garage, [**RV**](/can-you-use-a-propane-heater-in-an-rv/), or basement.

They have two essential components: an indoor heater and an outdoor propane tank that work together to heat up a room and make it comfortable to sit in.

## **How Does a Ventless Propane Heater Work?**

**A ventless propane heater works by burning propane gas while using oxygen (of the room it is inside) to produce heat energy.**

This type of heater is typically used in areas where traditional heating methods are impractical or impossible. The ventless propane heater operates by burning the propane gas in a sealed chamber. This chamber is designed to prevent the release of any fumes into the room.

As the gas is burned, it produces heat which is then circulated through a fan system. This fan is designed to circulate warm air throughout the room.

In addition, the fan helps to evenly distribute the heat, ensuring that all areas of the room are heated evenly.

The ventless propane heater is designed to be **99.9% efficient and cost-effective.** The heat produced by the heater is often much lower than that produced by traditional heating systems, meaning that you can save money on energy bills.

Additionally, the heater can be operated without the need for additional ventilation, allowing you to keep your home warm without needing to worry about additional ductwork or chimneys.

This makes the ventless propane heater an ideal choice for those areas where traditional heating systems are not feasible.

What’s even better about ventless propane heaters is that they burn all of the gas, unlike wood or pellets that do not completely burn down, and you are left to deal with the ash and smoke. With them, you do not have to deal with the residue.

## **Is a Ventless Propane Heater Safe?**

**Ventless propane heaters are an increasingly popular choice for heating indoor spaces. They are safe to use if properly installed and maintained according to manufacturer instructions. The key safety considerations for ventless propane heaters are proper ventilation, installation, and maintenance.**

**Proper ventilation is essential**, as the exhaust from the heater must be vented outside in order to prevent the build-up of dangerous [**carbon monoxide**](/do-space-heaters-emit-carbon-monoxide/) and other combustion gasses.

**Proper installation is also important,** as the heater must be installed according to the manufacturer's instructions to ensure proper functioning and to prevent the risk of fire or explosion.

Lastly, **regular maintenance is vital,** as it will ensure the heater is working as efficiently and safely as possible.

Ventless propane heaters are safe when used correctly, but it is important to remember that these heaters pose a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning if not properly vented. It is, therefore, important to ensure that the heater is installed and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions.

One of the safety issues the ventless propane heater poses is that it **depletes the oxygen from the room it is in**, as it does not use oxygen from the outdoors.

This is a major safety concern because it brings down oxygen levels in a room during winter, and during this time, the room is already not ventilated to let air in.

The experts, therefore, recommend not running the heaters for more than a couple of hours because this can increase the levels of carbon monoxide in a room, and it can be hazardous to human health.

## **Can You Use a Ventless Propane Heater Indoors?**

**Ventless propane heaters should not be used indoors if there isn’t a good ventilation system in the room. They produce carbon monoxide, which is an odorless and colorless gas that can be dangerous if inhaled in large quantities. When used indoors, carbon monoxide can quickly accumulate to dangerous levels. Therefore, ventilation is key.**

As mentioned above, a ventless propane heater takes up the oxygen of the room it is in to function properly, so it depletes the room of its natural oxygen. Along with that, it brings up the carbon monoxide levels of the room, making it hazardous to breathe in.

Unless there is no proper ventilation system in the room, it is not safe to use a ventless propane heater inside a room. If there is sufficient ventilation in the room, then a ventless propane heater is safe for use.

## **Pros of Ventless Propane Heaters**

These are the pros of ventless propane heaters:

**Cost-effective:** Ventless propane heaters are typically more affordable than traditional heaters, which makes them budget-friendly. You don’t have to invest a fortune to buy them.

**Energy-efficient:** They are also typically more efficient and can provide more BTUs (British Thermal Units) of heat per hour than traditional heaters. They are almost 99.9% efficient as they throw all the heat they produce into the room they are installed. Along with that, they save up on electricity bills (400%), too.

**Easy installation:** Ventless propane heaters are also very easy to install and can be moved around or stored away easily when not in use. They save up installation costs too, which is a huge bonus and another factor for their increased popularity.

**No outside ventilation required:** Ventless propane heaters do not require venting to the outside, unlike traditional heaters, which can increase the cost of installation and reduce room air quality.

## **Cons of Ventless Propane Heaters**

These are the cons of ventless propane heaters:

**Safety Risk:** Ventless propane heaters can be dangerous when not used properly. Since they do not vent gasses outside, they can create an unsafe buildup of carbon monoxide and other harmful gasses within the home.

Besides that, they deplete the oxygen in a room, which can cause breathing issues in people.

**Humidity:** The gasses and moisture are recycled back into the space because the fireplace doesn't produce smoke. This causes humidity issues in some homes, and such places can become a breeding ground for molds that pose a great threat to human health.

**Unpleasant Odor:** Many users report a strong and offensive odor when using ventless propane heaters, and many homeowners do not like it.

**Cost:** Ventless propane heaters are usually more expensive than other propane heating options.

**Difficulty Lighting:** Ventless propane heaters can be difficult to light and require frequent cleaning and maintenance.

## **How-to: Choose the Best Ventless Propane Heaters**

Now that we have covered the basics, let’s dig into the features that make ventless propane heaters stand out from the rest.

### **\#1 Size**

Choose a model that is designed for the size of your room. Make sure to check the maximum BTU rating for the heater and compare it to the size of your room. This will show you the maximum heating capacity of your heater and if it will be sufficient to warm up your space.

### **\#2 Installation**

Ventless propane heaters are designed to be wall-mounted or free-standing. Choose the type that best fits your space and make sure that you install it correctly.

### **\#3 Safety Features**

Look for safety features. Ventless propane heaters come with a variety of safety features, such as oxygen depletion sensors and automatic shut-off switches. Choose one with the features that best fit your needs.

### **\#4 Heating Efficiency**

Check for efficiency. To do that, look for heaters with an AFUE (annual fuel utilization efficiency) rating of at least 80%.

This will help ensure that you are getting the most efficient heating from your heater. If you decide to go for a higher BTU for the heater, the price will go higher.

Ideally, you should aim for around 40 BTU per square foot. To get a more accurate size for your ventless propane heater, you can use a [**Heating BTU calculator.**](https://www.bestheating.com/btu-calculator)

### **\#5 Price**

Consider the cost. Ventless propane heaters can range from very cheap to quite expensive. Consider your budget and make sure to choose a heater that fits your needs and is within your budget.

### **\#6 Thermostat**

The thermostat feature helps the heater to automatically control the temperature. It allows you to program your home's heating temperatures to match your schedule, lowering your overall energy bills.

If you want to save fuel, it may be best to purchase a propane heater with a thermostat setting (rather than a manual).

## **Final Thoughts**

This brings us to the end of the blog on ventless propane heaters, and we hope the detailed guide will help you make educated purchasing decisions.

They're easy to install, efficient, and economical heating options which is what makes them an ideal choice for many homeowners.
