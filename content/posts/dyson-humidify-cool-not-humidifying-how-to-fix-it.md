## How to Fix Your Dyson Pure Humidify+Cool Not Humidifying

**Most Common Reason:** Pump Column Clogged

![dyson humidifier pump column base cap](/img/dyson-humidifier-pump-column-base-cap.webp)The pump column is attached to the tank lid and pumps water. The base cap is the small, flat cap thing you can take off. The filter (right side) is oftentimes clogged and needs cleaning.

The pump column is a central component in your humidifier, responsible for drawing water from the tank and dispersing it into the air.

A clog in this part, especially at the base cap, can significantly hinder its ability to humidify.

The base cap, located at the bottom of the pump column, can accumulate mineral deposits or debris, obstructing the flow of water.

This blockage prevents the humidifier from properly functioning. By following these steps to clean the pump column and its base cap, you can often restore your humidifier's functionality:

### How to Fix a Clogged Pump Column

**To fix your Dyson Humidify+Cool not humidifying, clean the pump column base cap and scrub off all the residue blocking water flow.**

- **Remove Water Tank Lid (with Pump Column):** Carefully detach the water tank lid, ensuring you have a clear view of the pump column. This part is crucial for the humidifier function.
- **Take Off Pump Column Base Cap:** Locate the base cap of the pump column. This is typically found at the bottom of the column, and it should come off with a gentle twist or pull, depending on your model.
- **Scrub the Base Cap:** Use a soft-bristled brush or a cloth to clean the base cap. You can use soap if there’s a slimy film on it. Be thorough, but gentle, to avoid any damage. Rinse it under clean water to remove any debris or buildup.
- **(Optional) Run a Deep Clean Cycle:** This step is optional, but might help. Run a deep clean cycle. You can [force a deep clean cycle](/fix-dyson-deep-clean-cycle-not-working/) by quickly pressing the deep clean cycle button three times.

You can also buy a new [pump column base cap](https://www.dyson.com/support/journey/spare-details.970754-01) if yours is too dirty.

### What to Do if That Doesn’t Fix Your Problem

- **Check the Filter:** A dirty or clogged filter can also hinder the humidifying process. Remove the filter and check it for any blockages or dirt accumulation. If it looks dirty, replace it or clean it according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- **Clean the Air Quality & Moisture Sensors:** The sensors sit in the sides of the Dyson Humidify’s housing inside narrow holes. Clean these holes with a Q-tip. Optionally, you can use rubbing alcohol to help dissolve grease.
- **Ensure Adequate Water Quality:** The Dyson Pure Humidify+Cool is designed to work with clean water. If you're using hard or mineral-rich water, it can lead to deposits that clog the system. Consider using distilled or demineralized water if you live in a hard water area.  
To prevent clogging in the future, you can use water from a [distilled water maker](https://www.amazon.com/CO-Z-Distiller-Stainless-Distilling-Countertop/dp/B078GHJ921?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1RXRCQLSUHO38&keywords=distilled%2Bwater%2Bmaker&qid=1699692003&sprefix=distilled%2Bwater%2Bmaker%2Caps%2C88&sr=8-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=heatertips-20&linkId=3bf9b099cacf0fed2782d8ceccff1b12&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).
- **Reset the Device:** Sometimes, a simple reset can resolve technical glitches. Press the power button on the Dyson Humidify unit and the remote control _simultaneously_ for 10 seconds.

## How to Prevent Poor Humidification in a Dyson Pure Humidify+Cool in the Future

Maintaining your Dyson Pure Humidify+Cool is crucial for ensuring long-term performance and air quality. Here are some enhanced maintenance strategies to help prevent humidification issues:

1. **Regular Deep Clean Cycles:** Schedule deep cleaning cycles as recommended by your device's manual. Normally, your Dyson Humidify+Cool prompts you in regular intervals to perform a deep clean cycle. If you never get prompts, you can also _force_ a deep clean cycle. Usually, the deep cleaning should be done every month.
1. **Frequent Manual Cleaning of the Pump Column Base Cap:** Remove and manually clean the pump column base cap every 2 to 4 weeks. Use a gentle brush or cloth to clear away any mineral deposits or buildup. This will ensure that water can flow freely, which is essential for proper humidification.
1. **Sensor Maintenance:** Keep the humidity and air quality sensors clean. Dust and debris can cause inaccurate readings, leading to improper functioning. Gently wipe the sensors with a soft, dry cloth every few months or as specified in the user manual.

By implementing these steps, you'll not only prevent humidification issues but also extend the life of your Dyson Pure Humidify+Cool. Regular maintenance helps to ensure that your home remains a haven of clean, comfortable air.
