---
Dyson Humidify+Cool models cost a hefty price. The recent PH04 is around $900. Older models such as the PH03 still sell for $700 - $800.

But what’s so special about a Dyson humidifier? Can it do more than just add humidity to your room? And is getting one worth it?

In this article, we’re going to have a critical look at Dyson Humidify+Cool models, checking out how well they really perform and if they do justify their price tag.

Are Dyson Humidify+Cool fans worth it, or are they just empty marketing claims?

Quick answer:

The Dyson Humidify+Cool series combines air purification, humidification, and cooling in a sleek design, but at up to $900, it may not offer enough value for everyone. While technologically advanced, similar benefits can often be achieved with separate, more affordable devices.

## What Sets the Dyson Humidify+Cool Apart?

Dyson is a well-known name in the world of home comfort appliances, promising top-tier performance and sleek design. But beyond their polished looks, what really makes the Dyson Humidify+Cool models stand out? Let's take a closer look at their features and technology.

In particular, we’re looking at [the **Dyson Humidify+Cool PH04 model**(click to see it on amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Purifier-Humidify-Cool-Formaldehyde/dp/B0B3F749ZJ?&linkCode=ll1&tag=heatertips-20&linkId=92269a233167119a8cf41260326eb811&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) and similar (PH03, PH3A).

### Innovative Features

The Dyson Humidify+Cool machines do more than just add moisture to the air. They serve three functions: they purify, humidify, and cool your space. One key feature is the HEPA filter, which is designed to capture tiny particles like allergens and pollutants.

Plus, they have a **UV-C light to clean the water**, ensuring that the moisture they release is free from bacteria.

These devices also provide updates on your indoor air quality through the Dyson Link app, which allows you to track and adjust your air treatment as needed.

### Design and Aesthetics

Dyson's designs are modern and attention-grabbing. Their bladeless fans are **safe to use around children and pets**, and they're simple to clean - no awkward grilles or blades. The devices are built with ease in mind; they have straightforward controls, a simple remote, and a display that’s easy to understand.

### Technology Overview

The technology behind the Humidify+Cool series is centered on what Dyson calls **Air Multiplier™ technology**.

![dyson humidify cool air multiplier technology air quality monitoring lcd](/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dyson-humidify-cool-air-multiplier-technology-air-quality-monitoring-lcd.jpg)

It’s a fancy term for a simple concept: Air multiplier technology is all about narrowing the escape area of the airstream to speed up airflow (but reduce airflow diameter).

This feature draws air into the machine and pushes it out smoothly, creating a steady and powerful flow of purified, humidified air across the room.

Moreover, the built-in climate control means the machine can monitor the room's temperature and humidity, adjusting itself to ensure the environment stays comfortable without adding too much moisture.

What I personally enjoy most is the **detailed air quality monitoring**, achieved by a set of sensors for various particle sizes and specific chemicals (formaldehyde). Even high-end air purifiers don’t offer as detailed air quality reports as a Dyson.

In conclusion, Dyson's Humidify+Cool models combine functionality with design and user-friendly technology. These aspects might make the higher price point more palatable for those who prioritize advanced features and ease of use.

## What Does Owning a Dyson Humidify+Cool Cost?

When you're shelling out up to $900 for a humidifier and fan combo, it's important to understand what you're actually paying for. Let's dissect the cost and see if the features of the Dyson Humidify+Cool can justify the hefty price tag.

### Price Analysis

Buying a Dyson Humidify+Cool is an investment in a piece of technology that does more than just blow air. It's equipped with the following features:

- advanced air purification, using a HEPA filter to trap tiny particles
- a UV-C light to sterilize the water, similar to specialized air purifiers and water sanitization systems
- smart home integration
- app controls to control your device from your phone or get real-time air quality updates
- regular fan mode

If you look at each feature individually, a Dyson Humidify+Cool would only be worth it if each feature was worth >$100-$200 to you.

I’d say that’s hardly the case.

You can get a self-standing air purifier for $100 that cleans the air just as well. You can get a water sterilizer for $50. You can get a regular fan (much stronger than the Dyson) for $50.

**The value of a Dyson Humidify+Cool stems from the seamless combination of air purification, humidification, ventilation, and smart app controls. You can save money by buying fans, air purifiers, and humidifiers separately, which clutter your room. But with a Dyson Humidify+Cool, it’s all in one unit.**

Whether that’s worth close to a thousand dollars to you is a personal question. To many people it is.

It is important to reflect whether you need _all_ of the features, or whether you want just a purifier or humidifier. In this case, buying individual devices is, financially speaking, the sane choice.

We’ll have a look at competitors and their price tags later.

### Performance Evaluation

#### Functionality

In everyday use, Dyson Humidify+Cool models are designed to adapt to your room's climate.

This adaptability means you're not constantly fiddling with settings - the machine's sensors do the work, adjusting the airflow to maintain the right balance of humidity and temperature.

But how does it perform with the core function - humidifying plus cooling? Users report that it's exceptional at creating a comfortable environment, especially in areas with dry or polluted air.

And the cool breeze is a bonus, making it useful year-round, not just in dry winter months.

#### Efficiency

The energy consumption of these models is competitive with other high-end appliances.

**A Dyson Humidify+Cool consumes 30 - 60 Watts, depending on the humidity of the air and the fan setting.**

Fans and humidifiers are generally low-power devices. So, it’s not a special accomplishment from Dyson that their Humidify+Cool devices are energy-efficient.

They're designed to run efficiently, with features like an auto-shutoff and night mode, which help conserve energy when full power isn't needed. This means that, over time, the cost of running a Dyson Humidify+Cool can be even lower than expected.

**Running a Dyson Humidify+Cool costs 11 cents per day.**

( I used an average power consumption of 30 Watts and an [electricity rate](https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/data/averageenergyprices_selectedareas_table.htm) of 17 cents for the calculation )

## Air Quality & Pollution: Does a Dyson Humidify+Cool Clean The Air?

### Air Quality

The Dyson Humidify+Cool’s ability to improve air quality lies not just in its HEPA filtration, which traps fine particles, but also in its humidification process that can help decrease the presence of airborne pathogens.

Dry air allows pathogens to travel more easily, and by maintaining optimal humidity, the Dyson unit can indirectly reduce this risk.

The cooling function doesn't directly purify the air, but it does distribute the cleaned and humidified air more evenly throughout the room, increasing overall comfort and ensuring that purified air reaches more areas.

**With its HEPA filter, a Dyson Humidity+Cool cleans the air just as well as any other air purifier. Since the filter follows the HEPA standard, the air purification is neither better nor worse than other air purifiers.**

![dyson humidify cool filter replacement](/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dyson-humidify-cool-filter-replacement.jpg)The HEPA filter in a Dyson Humidify+Cool looks high-tech. And it is. But it is not any better than any other HEPA filter in a regular air purifier.

### Health Impact

Using a Dyson Humidify+Cool could bring potential health benefits, especially for those with allergies or respiratory issues.

The cleaner air produced by the HEPA filter means [fewer allergens to trigger symptoms](https://acaai.org/allergies/management-treatment/living-with-allergies/air-filters/).

Moreover, the UV-C light ensures the humidity added to the air is germ-free, which is crucial for those with compromised immune systems or asthma.

However, it's essential to note that while these devices can improve indoor air quality, they are **not a cure-all for health issues and should be used as part of a broader approach to health and well-being**.

## Longevity and Durability: Does a Dyson Humidify+Cool fan last?

When you're investing in a high-end appliance like the Dyson Humidify+Cool, longevity and durability are key considerations. Dyson is known for its commitment to quality and design, but how does this translate into the lifespan of their products?

### Build Quality

Dyson products generally have an acceptable build quality and feel luxurious.

Still, they are mostly plastic and don’t make use of durable, high-quality materials such as metal or wood.

For close to $900, you can expect more than that.

**You’re paying a luxury price, but you don’t get luxury material.**

### Technical Issues in Dyson Humidify+Cool fans

**Dyson Humidify fans are the most fragile type of Dyson fan.** They have several known issues, that can be _very_ annoying to deal with.

There are some issues, such as the [deep clean cycle not working](/fix-dyson-deep-clean-cycle-not-working/) (for self-cleaning of limestone in the water tank) and annoying error codes ( [F3 error](/dyson-f3-error-code-fix/)).

These problems oftentimes require time-intense repairs, or don’t go away at all.

To resolve them, you need to rely on Dyson customer support, which seems to be ignorant of these issues.

Ideally, they send you a replacement humidifier. But overall, it’s a lot of hassle to get technical issues in a Dyson fan resolved.

So, if you’re someone who wants a no-maintenance product, then a Dyson fan is not for you.

The high price does not protect you from having to troubleshoot technical problems.

![dyson humidify deep clean cycle stuck problem](/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/dyson-humidify-deep-clean-cycle-stuck-problem.jpg)The deep clean cycle oftentimes gets stuck after a few seconds on Dyson Humidify+Cool fans. Very annoying and hard to fix.

## Is It Worth the Investment?

When considering whether the Dyson Humidify+Cool is worth its high price tag, it’s essential to examine the cost versus benefit and understand the scenarios where this product shines.

### Total Cost of a Dyson Humidify Fan

- **Initial Purchase Price**: $700 - $900
- **Energy Consumption**: Approx. $15.56/year (based on 5 hours/day usage at highest setting)

In conclusion, while the Dyson Humidify+Cool stands out for its unique combination of features, design, and technology, the market does offer a range of alternatives. Depending on specific needs and budget, consumers can opt for more affordable or even more advanced options, though they might have to compromise on either the multifunctionality or the sleek design that Dyson offers.

## Conclusion

In summary, the Dyson Humidify+Cool is a high-end product that combines air purification, humidification, and sleek design. It’s **clearly not a budget-friendly choice** and, as we’ve seen, there are more affordable options out there.

When weighing its cost against its benefits, it’s crucial to ask yourself whether the advanced features really match your needs and are worth the extra money. Yes, it’s a versatile device, but the price is steep, and the benefits might not be essential for everyone.

On a personal note, while I appreciate the technology and design that Dyson offers, it’s important to be realistic about whether its high cost translates into equally high value for you. Also, considering the issues with durability and maintenance, it’s **not a worry-free investment**.

If you’re thinking about getting a Dyson Humidify+Cool, take a hard look at your actual needs and budget. And for those who have used it, I’d love to hear your thoughts – do you find it worth the investment? For others still deciding, it might be wise to compare and explore other options before making the final call.
