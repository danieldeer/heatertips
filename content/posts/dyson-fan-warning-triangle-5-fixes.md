When your Dyson fan shows a warning triangle with an exclamation mark, something is wrong.

Aside from the warning triangle, your Dyson fan does not give you any further information about the issue, and no instructions on what to do now.

In this article, we’ll have a quick look at the warning triangle error, what causes it, and what you should do about it.

Hi, my name is Daniel, I’m an electrical engineer. I’ve worked in a large repair department of an electronics company before. Let’s have a look at what’s going on together.

What causes your Dyson fan to suddenly show the Warning Triangle

**Dyson fans show the warning triangle with the exclamation mark when there is an issue in the electric circuitry.**

The warning sign issue frequently occurs in brand-new Dyson fans out of the box.

Likely, Dyson fans with the warning triangle error were not properly handled in Dyson’s quality control or were damaged during transport.

The warning sign has _nothing_ to do with:

- the filter (as long as it’s reasonably clean)
- the remote control
- the power supply

## How to Fix the Dyson Warning Triangle

The Dyson warning triangle error is usually easy to clear. Here’s how:

### 1\. Lower Fan Speed Before the Warning Triangle Shows

Oftentimes, the warning triangle error occurs when the fan speed is set to 10 (highest), and the Dyson fan is turned off afterward.

When you turn on your Dyson fan then, it immediately starts blowing air at the highest possible fan speed, which possibly overloads the electric circuitry.

This issue is oftentimes introduced by Dyson’s quality control team. Dyson quality control employees have to reset the fan to a low-moderate fan speed before boxing it up. When you turn on your brand-new Dyson fan and it starts at fan speed 10, Dyson’s quality control team skipped a step in the quality control procedure.

Of course, you can also create the issue yourself when you run your Dyson fan at the highest possible setting and shut it off.

#### How to fix it

**Turn on your Dyson fan and** **_before_** **the warning triangle shows, quickly lower the fan speed.**

#### How to prevent it

To prevent this issue in the future, lower your fan speed before turning your Dyson fan off.

### 2\. Clean Start by Holding the Power Button on the Remote and Fan Simultaneously

Another potential cause of the issue can be an issue with the onboard software. Oftentimes, a special clean start helps.

Clean start your Dyson fan like this:

- Unplug your Dyson fan from the wall outlet.
- Press and hold the power button on the device for 10 seconds while the device is unplugged.
- Plug it back in.
- Quickly **press and hold the power button on the fan and on the remote simultaneously for 10 seconds**.

### 3\. Turn the Dyson Fan Upside Down

Some people report that flipping the fan upside down while turning it on helps. It’s an odd workaround, but it seems to help sometimes.

**Flip your Dyson fan upside down and turn it on.** You might need assistance and have someone hold it for you.

Does the warning triangle error still show?

### 4\. Warranty: Request a Refund / Replacement Device

If nothing helps, **request a refund or a replacement device**.

Either contact Dyson support, or, preferably, the store you bought your Dyson fan from.

Usually, Dyson support tries to go through troubleshooting with you. But they don’t have a clue either and will either replace your device (after endless discussion and calls), or they’ll try to sell you a repair with replacement parts that costs $150.

So, contacting shop support is easier.

This, of course, only works within the warranty period.

### 5\. Sell your Dyson Fan as Defective and Buy a New One

Only do this if your fan is out of warranty.

Sell your Dyson fan with the warning triangle error online. List it as defective.

You can still get a good amount of money since there are many repair & flipping businesses looking for broken Dyson fans.

Then, spend the money from your sale on a new Dyson fan. The cost of buying a new fan considering the income from selling the broken one can be even lower than that of a repair.

( The reason for that is that repair businesses specialize in this and can repair Dyson fans quickly and cheaply, so even if they pay you a high price, they’ll still profit - their margin is very low because competition is high )

As a replacement fan, I recommend a Dyson Hot+Cool fan. My recommendation is the [**Dyson Hot+Cool HP10** (click here to view it on amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Purifier-CoolTM-Gen1-HP10/dp/B0CDQW6Q7W?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=cqECA&content-id=amzn1.sym.952cfb50-b01e-485f-be6e-00434541418b%3Aamzn1.symc.e5c80209-769f-4ade-a325-2eaec14b8e0e&pf_rd_p=952cfb50-b01e-485f-be6e-00434541418b&pf_rd_r=J1BX7HH9EBVHSQPMFPS8&pd_rd_wg=dUwZi&pd_rd_r=2f1f2aa3-ea1c-4010-b8bf-0d06e4d377ff&linkCode=ll1&tag=heatertips-20&linkId=c206775ab7c1456ffba3e27c8969407c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).

## Conclusion

In most cases, you should be able to fix your Dyson fan showing the warning triangle error by quickly lowering the fan speed after turning it on.

If that doesn’t work, try the clean start (holding the power button of the remote and the fan at the same time).

If you can’t fix your Dyson fan, I recommend either handing your Dyson fan in for a replacement or selling it and buying a new one.

All the effort and frustration is oftentimes not worth it. Just getting a new fan is the quickest & safest way to solve the issue.
