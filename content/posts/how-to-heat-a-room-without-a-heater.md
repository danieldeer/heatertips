It's not the best idea to use heaters, especially at this point when utility costs are so high. However, you obviously cannot let yourself freeze to death. I've got some pretty good alternatives for you that will heat your space without using a heater. How amazing would that be?

**Quick answer: You can heat a room without a heater using candles, running electronics, an electric blanket, a hair dryer, or simply wearing warm clothing. The cheapest method to heat a room is using a low-wattage infrared heater since it bundles heat radiation.**

Let's not waste any more time and start on ways to heat your room without using a heater.

## 1\. Heat Using Candles

[Using candles to heat your room](/how-many-candles-do-you-need-to-heat-a-room/) may appear inexpensive, but this is not the case.

Candles may, without a doubt, generate heat fairly effectively. Although it doesn't heat a space as effectively as a real heater, considering that one candle has an 80W heating power, it nevertheless manages to warm a room adequately.

_The maximum number of candles you might need to heat a space effectively is 20, after which you're set to go._

Getting 20 candles may seem like no great deal since it won't cost you much, and you can purchase them easily from any nearby supermarket. But hang on…

Consider the duration of a candle's burn. As for how long a candle will burn, it depends on its size, but after they are all used up, you'll need to replace them with new ones. And since you will need to buy numerous candles, replacing them would not be inexpensive anymore.

Whatever the situation, I believe that heating your room with candles is not the best alternative. It is advised not to light too many candles in confined spaces with [poor air circulation](https://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/08/21/candles.air.pollution/) because doing so can result in a fire hazard.

Here are a few suggestions to bear in mind if you're still considering using candles to heat your room:

- Watch where you set the candles to prevent anything from catching fire in your room.
- Keep the candles out while you are sleeping.
- Don't let the candles burn unattended.
- Last but not least, remember to put the candles in a candle holder.

## 2\. Heat Using a Clay Pot Heater

Heating your room with a clay pot heater is similar to heating with candles because both methods require candles.

As the name implies, you utilize two to three clay pots and stack them on top of one another. You place a candle within the pot, which concentrates the heat from the candle flame into one spot and then radiates it forth. It produces a surprising amount of heat.

**» I have created a detailed guide on** [**How to Build Terracotta Clay Pot Heater**](/how-to-build-a-terracotta-clay-pot-heater/)

The best thing is that it is the simplest and least expensive DIY project and produces excellent heating results.

However, as there are many advantages, there are also some disadvantages. When numerous candles are placed together, the melted paraffin wax from all of them can ignite. Furthermore, when the pots become hot, touching them might cause burns.

## 3\. Turn On Lights

Did you know that the light bulb produces 95% more heat than light? How incredible.

It's a good idea to leave the bulbs and lamps open because they will produce heat, especially if they are red and yellow.

However, since it isn't a proper method of heating, it will definitely not be as efficient as a heater. In addition, opening so many lights in your room may result in a higher electricity bill. Plus, you can't keep the lights on at all times in case you want to sleep.

Also, if a high-wattage light is left on for a long period of time, there is a chance that it could overheat, which might lead to sockets melting or even the burning of wires.

## 4\. Absorb Heat Using Dark Window Shades

Dark window shades trap heat in the room. These shades lessen the amount of heat that is transmitted through the window.

Therefore, you might choose dark window coverings to keep the heat inside your room.

To trap it, you must first heat the room, which you can do by using the other options listed in the article.

## 5\. Heat Using an Electric Blanket

An [electric blanket](/space-heater-vs-electric-blanket-21-pros-and-cons/) is a modern innovation that works well to warm you rather than the entire room. Additionally, it is quite comfortable and energy-efficient. They cost significantly less to operate than an expensive, unreliable heater.

If you're thinking about obtaining an electric blanket, be careful not to put anything over it because doing so could make it overheat, pose a fire risk, or even lead you to get burned.

Unfortunately, if you're searching for a means to heat up your room because you have to work or whatever and don't want to spend the day wrapped in a blanket, this alternative may not be the best option for you.

Furthermore, it contributes to [pregnancy-related hyperthermia](https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy/health-and-safety/is-it-safe-to-sleep-with-an-electric-blanket-during-pregnanc_1246864), so it is not advised for those who are expecting.

## 6\. Improve Your Room’s Insulation

I must say that upgrading your room's insulation will fix your heating problem. Let's go over some methods by which you can insulate your space.

### Use Draft Stoppers

When your windows or doors have cracks or openings, the air from outside is exchanged and cools your space. You can use draft stoppers to prevent this from happening. One option is to roll up a thick towel and lay it beneath the door or the bottom of the window.

### Seal Air Leaks

In order to stop cold air from entering, you can also seal the air leaks or place weatherstripping between the window frame and stash. You can use plastic film to cover the windows and keep them from freezing.

### Switch the Window Coverings

Additionally, you can choose a bright color for your curtains or blinds to escape the winter aura or convert to thicker or insulated window coverings that will keep the chilly air out.

## 7\. Move Hot Objects Into the Room

You can move hot objects in your room to allow them to emit heat into the space. A wood stove or a hot water bottle are two examples of such objects.

### Hot Water Bottle

Despite its size, a hot water bottle performs effectively. It can be tucked under your sheets and keeps your feet warm. A hot water bottle won't be very helpful if you're trying to warm up more than one area or part of your body, though, since it acts more like a heat pack and simply warms the area or part of your body where you set it.

### Wood Stove

A room may be efficiently heated by a [wood stove](/how-long-does-a-wood-stove-take-to-heat-up/) owing to its strong heating capacity. Although it evenly spreads the warm air, it has a few drawbacks.

Both indoor and outdoor pollution from wood stoves can result in major health concerns like breathing difficulties, heart attacks, lung cancer, and other conditions.

Therefore, avoiding using a wood stove is best if you or anybody else in your home has [health issues](https://www.lung.org/clean-air/at-home/indoor-air-pollutants/residential-wood-burning).

## 8\. Buy a New Heater

So what if you don't have a built-in heater? Consider using a portable space heater instead. There are various kinds of space heaters, including infrared and oil-filled radiators.

An oil-filled heater focuses on heating your room evenly and more forcefully, whilst an infrared heater provides fast heating.

An oil-filled heater is recommended if you plan to use it in your bedroom.

These space heaters unquestionably give safe and dependable heat and are an excellent option if you're thinking about buying one, but they also have certain **don'ts** that you need to be aware of.

1. To avoid contact between the two, do not set the heater close to the bedding.
1. Do not leave a space heater unattended in a child's room.

Even though a modern [space heater is very safe to use](/what-is-the-safest-space-heater/) for extended periods of time, even while sleeping, check to see if it has a safety function that immediately switches it off in an instance that the heater tips over or overheats.

## 9\. Wear Warm Clothes

Wearing additional layers of clothing is one technique to stay warm if you don't have a heater for your room. The truth is that wearing so many layers when at home might be irritating, even though adding more layers can make you feel warmer and insulate your body.

Nonetheless, here are some tips for staying warm with extra clothing:

1. Put on a thermal base layer.
1. Add a sweatshirt or hoodie on top.
1. Put on clothing made of cotton, fleece, or wool.
1. Not to mention, don't forget to put on some thick socks and a woolen beanie.

## 10\. Warm-Up Bedding

Let's just accept that spending the day in a warm, comfy bed is something we would all sacrifice anything for. And what else could you possibly desire in the winter?

Another great way to remain warm is to increase the heat in your bed. Yes, it won't warm the room, but as long as it keeps you toasty, I'll consider it a perfect substitute.

Here are some options for warming up your bedding:

### Purchase High-Quality Blankets

A warm blanket on top of your sheets will keep you cozy. Get a heavy blanket or a comforter and curl up in it. However, you should be aware that blankets alone won't keep you warm because they act as a heat trap, which is useless if there isn't any heat, to begin with.

Therefore, as mentioned earlier, you can put a hot water bottle inside your blanket or even blow dry your sheets to release heat before trapping it with a high-quality blanket.

### Purchase a Bed Heater

The best investment you can make is a bed heater. It instantly warms the bed and blows air directly under your sheets. Even though it is quite pricey, it is worthwhile because it saves energy and money compared to a real heater.

## 11\. Heat by Running Electronics

Running electronics generate heat. The energy that is produced inside the devices is converted into heat. Gaming systems, TVs, laptops, and other devices are a few examples.

Operating a 130W PC generates the same heat as running a 130W space heater. How convenient to use your computer for work and as a heater simultaneously.

## What’s the Safest Way to Heat a Room Without a Heater?

**Insulating your room is the safest method to heat it without using a heater. There is no chance of an electric shock, overheating, or anything else to worry about because it doesn't consume electricity.**

Simply seal off the openings where cold air enters the room to prevent it from getting in, and then heat the space once using any method you choose to create a warm setting. The great advantage is that you won't need to use electrical devices or methods for very long before you start worrying about hazards.

You only need to heat your room once and cover any drafts; you're good to go!

## What’s the Cheapest Way to Heat a Room Without a Heater?

**The most affordable method of heating a room is with a space heater. Since there are different kinds of space heaters, the infrared heater is the most affordable. They operate with fewer watts and provide heat quickly because they immediately radiate after turning on.**

[Space heaters are relatively inexpensive](/do-space-heaters-save-money/) if you turn down your central heating and they can be used to heat a single room. They are available in various sizes and styles; some even come with features such as timers and remote controls.

Space heaters can be placed on the floor or a table, and they typically use electricity to generate heat.
