  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Your space heater makes a clicking noise and you’re not sure where it’s coming from and whether your heater is broken?
I’ve had this myself: I was comfortably sitting on my couch, with my infrared heater keeping my feet warm. It was really comfortable and I totally concentrated on the book. All of a sudden, there was a loud clicking noise. It was a quick clicking sound, just like the sound you often hear right after turning on an oven or an air conditioner.

Whenever you heat your room with a space heater, the air gets dryer and dryer. Sometimes even so much that it makes you uncomfortable.
The level of humidity in your room can make a big difference for your wellbeing.
Too dry air will make your skin feel dried out and your throat can get sore. Too humid air will make you feel sweaty at home.

    <p>Heating a wedding tent is one of the things you should never forget while planning your wedding.
Having shivering guests is one of the worst things that can happen to you. Being cold keeps the mood down and your guests might even remember your event as an ice-disaster.
Once, I’ve had a party that was simply too cold. I just didn’t plan the weather in and thought, the party tent would keep the cold out. That was not the case:

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Are there any space heaters with long cords? I just had to answer this question, when I noticed that my space heater cord isn’t long enough to place my heater anywhere I wanted.
To find the space heater with the longest cords, I’ve researched for hours, browsing through product descriptions and manuals to find the lengths of the cords of dozens of space heaters.
And it was pretty difficult to get the values. It seems like companies try to hide the cord length on purpose. But why?
What I found was surprising. Keep reading to find out!

That question first got me thinking when I was on a boat trip on the Rhine river in Germany in the springtime and all the passengers shivered throughout the tour: There was no heater on the boat.
But why is heating a boat cabin important? By heating a boat, you not only feel more comfortable, but you also benefit some technical aspects of the boat: Heat protects the water and sewage system and the engine compartment from freezing.

    <p>How can you heat a garage without insulation? What’s the best way to do it? Is it possible to heat effectively? And if yes, how?
Generally speaking, garages can get uncomfortably cold in the wintertime. Especially when your garage is without insulation.
Entering a cold garage is and having no option to heat it effectively is like jumping into cold water - it’s just uncomfortable and everyone hates it.
Especially if you have a garage woodworking shop (or similar), it adds a lot of enjoyment if you can heat your space whenever you like.
