  "articleBody": "Whether a swamp cooler works depends on the climate in your area. In this article, we’re having a quick glance at all US states and whether swamp coolers work there or not.\nQuick answer: Swamp coolers work in almost every US state during the afternoon, because that is the driest time of the day. Using a swamp cooler all day and throughout the year only makes sense in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.\nDoes a swamp cooler work in your state? I spent some time figuring out in which states swamp coolers make sense according to average humidity values.\nIf you stick out until the end of this article, you will see why these average humidities are useless to determine swamp cooler effectiveness.\nBut let’s have a look at the data first. Don’t take the “Does a swamp cooler work in this state”-column too seriously for now.\nState Average relative humidity Does a swamp cooler work in this state? Alabama 68% no Alaska 71% no Arizona 39% yes Arkansas 67% no California 69% no Colorado 48% yes Connecticut 66% no Delaware 67% no Florida 72% no Georgia 68% no Hawaii 64% no Idaho 55% yes Illinois 71% no Indiana 71% no Iowa 67% no Kansas 65% no Kentucky 67% no Louisiana 74% no Maine 72% no Maryland 65% no Massachusetts 67% no Michigan 73% no Minnesota 67% no Mississippi 73% no Missouri 68% no Montana 58% yes Nebraska 68% no Nevada 52% yes New Hampshire 69% no New Jersey 71% no New Mexico 45% yes New York 72% no North Carolina 68% no North Dakota 66% no Ohio 69% no Oklahoma 64% no Oregon 72% no Pennsylvania 66% no Rhode Island 68% no South Carolina 68% no South Dakota 68% no Tennessee 69% no Texas 66% no Utah 55% yes Vermont 68% no Virginia 68% no Washington 73% no West Virginia 71% no Wisconsin 71% no Wyoming 53% yes The humidity data in the table is based on this source.\nWhy you can’t trust the data The table contains average humidity climate data. If the average humidity in a given state is smaller than 60%, it states that a swamp cooler works, else it doesn’t.\nHowever, you can’t fully trust the table with its climate averages when it comes to using swamp coolers.\nUsually, you need a swamp cooler when it is exceptionally hot . So, by definition, average data is not useful.\nFor example, the average humidity in California is 69% and comparably high. Which is why the table above states that a swamp cooler is ineffective there.\nHowever, the table above includes the average humidity levels over an entire year, including summer and winter, which have vastly different climates. Also, it does not differentiate between morning and afternoon humidity.\nMorning and afternoon swamp cooler usage Mornings tend to be humid (you can tell because of the morning dew), while afternoons and evenings are comparably dry.\nLet’s have another look at all US states, but this time let’s check if a swamp cooler works there in the afternoon.\nState Average relative humidity in the afternoon Does a swamp cooler work? Alabama 52% yes Alaska 64% no Arizona 25% yes Arkansas 49% yes California 62% no Colorado 35% yes Connecticut 52% yes Delaware 54% yes Florida 57% yes Georgia 50% yes Hawaii 56% yes Idaho 41% yes Illinois 58% yes Indiana 58% yes Iowa 56% yes Kansas 50% yes Kentucky 55% yes Louisiana 61% no Maine 61% no Maryland 52% yes Massachusetts 59% yes Michigan 61% no Minnesota 55% yes Mississippi 54% yes Missouri 53% yes Montana 45% yes Nebraska 53% yes Nevada 32% yes New Hampshire 53% yes New Jersey 59% yes New Mexico 29% yes New York 61% no North Carolina 52% yes North Dakota 51% yes Ohio 57% yes Oklahoma 48% yes Oregon 59% yes Pennsylvania 54% yes Rhode Island 57% yes South Carolina 49% yes South Dakota 53% yes Tennessee 53% yes Texas 49% yes Utah 43% yes Vermont 58% yes Virginia 52% yes Washington 62% no West Virginia 59% yes Wisconsin 58% yes Wyoming 43% yes As you can see in this afternoon-humidity table, a swamp cooler works in almost any US state in the afternoon and early evening heat.\nSo, getting a swamp cooler for the very hot and dry summer days is worth it almost anywhere.\nA typical 24-hour humidity chart looks like this:\nAs you can see in the sample data above, the humidity reaches almost 80% humidity during the night time. However, during day time, humidity sinks below 20%.\nOf course, this is an extreme example. Here, the humidity varies by \u003e60%! Some places never reach humidities below 30%.\nBut a variation of 40-50% is definitely possible in most places.\nAnd that’s what everybody forgets about. Everybody claims that getting a swamp cooler is not worth it in the more humid states.\nYes, that’s true if you assume that the actual weather sticks to the average values. But that’s not how weather works.\nWe have sunshine and rain, hot and cold. And it always alternates. Using averages makes no sense when it comes to evaluating whether to use a swamp cooler.\nSo, even in humid states, you will have hot and dry days. On these days, a swamp cooler is definitely worth getting.\nClimate zones within states Furthermore, there are very different climate zones within states.\nFor example, in California, there is the bay area, which is humid, and the deserts in the backcountry deserts, which are very dry.\nWhile in the bay area, a swamp cooler does not make sense, in the dry areas it does make sense.\nThat is the case for almost any state. Even if the tables above say that on average a swamp cooler is not worth getting, oftentimes it can still be worth it, depending on the humidity at your home.\nHow to measure your home’s humidity The best way to tell whether a swamp cooler works where you live is to measure your local humidity.\nAfter you know the humidity levels around your house, you can tell whether the local weather around your home deviates from the state-wide average.\nYou can easily measure humidity using a hygrometer (click here to view it on amazon).\nFor example, where I live, there is vastly different climate than in the other parts of my state. That’s because my home is in an area with small mountains and a lot of forest.\nWhen I watch weather forecasts, I can immediately tell that the temperature at my home is going to be at least 5°F cooler.\nAlternatively: You can also check your city-specific climate online. I like to use weather.com. Enter your city in the search box and view the weather table.\nHow to interpret humidity readings for swamp cooler effectivity Once you have the humidity readings of your hygrometer (or the weather website), you can judge whether a swamp cooler is worth getting.\nHere’s the golden swamp cooler rule:\n“A swamp cooler is worth running if the humidity reaches 50% or lower over the course of a day”\nSo, even if mornings are very humid in your area (as they are in most places), a swamp cooler is still worth getting if the humidity decreases during the hot hours of the day.\n",

<p>The humidity data in the table is based on <a href="https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/annual-average-humidity-by-state.php">this source</a>.</p>

<p>The table contains <em>average</em> humidity climate data. If the average humidity in a given state is smaller than 60%, it states that a swamp cooler works, else it doesn’t.</p>
<p>However, you can’t fully trust the table with its climate <em>averages</em> when it comes to using swamp coolers.</p>
<p><strong>Usually, you need a swamp cooler when it is</strong> <strong><em>exceptionally hot</em></strong> <strong>. So, by definition, average data is not useful.</strong></p>
<p>For example, the average humidity in California is 69% and comparably high. Which is why the table above states that a swamp cooler is ineffective there.</p>
<p>However, the table above includes the average humidity levels over an entire year, including summer and winter, which have vastly different climates. Also, it does not differentiate between morning and afternoon humidity.</p>
<h2 id="morning-and-afternoon-swamp-cooler-usage">Morning and afternoon swamp cooler usage<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#morning-and-afternoon-swamp-cooler-usage">#</a></h2>
<p>Mornings tend to be humid (you can tell because of the morning dew), while afternoons and evenings are comparably dry.</p>
<p>Let’s have another look at all US states, but this time let’s check if a swamp cooler works there <em>in the afternoon.</em></p>

<p>As you can see in this afternoon-humidity table, <strong>a swamp cooler works in almost any US state in the afternoon and early evening heat.</strong></p>
<p>So, getting a swamp cooler for the very hot and dry summer days is worth it almost anywhere.</p>
<p>A typical <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johannes-Viljoen">24-hour humidity chart</a> looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="24-hour humidity chart" loading="lazy" src="/img/24-hour-humidity.webp"></p>
<p>As you can see in the sample data above, the humidity reaches almost 80% humidity during the night time. However, during day time, humidity sinks below 20%.</p>
<p>Of course, this is an extreme example. Here, the humidity varies by &gt;60%! Some places never reach humidities below 30%.</p>
<p>But a variation of 40-50% is definitely possible in most places.</p>
<p>And that’s what <em>everybody</em> forgets about. Everybody claims that getting a swamp cooler is not worth it in the more humid states.</p>
<p>Yes, that’s true if you assume that the actual weather sticks to the average values. But that’s not how weather works.</p>
<p>We have sunshine and rain, hot and cold. And it always alternates. Using averages makes no sense when it comes to evaluating whether to use a swamp cooler.</p>
<p>So, even in humid states, you will have hot and dry days. On these days, a swamp cooler is definitely worth getting.</p>
<h2 id="climate-zones-within-states">Climate zones within states<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#climate-zones-within-states">#</a></h2>
<p>Furthermore, there are very different climate zones within states.</p>
<p>For example, in California, there is the bay area, which is humid, and the deserts in the backcountry deserts, which are very dry.</p>
<p>While in the bay area, a swamp cooler does not make sense, in the dry areas it does make sense.</p>
<p>That is the case for almost any state. Even if the tables above say that <em>on average</em> a swamp cooler is not worth getting, oftentimes it can still be worth it, depending on the humidity at your home.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-measure-your-homes-humidity">How to measure your home’s humidity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-measure-your-homes-humidity">#</a></h2>
<p>The best way to tell whether a swamp cooler works where you live is to measure your local humidity.</p>
<p>After you know the humidity levels around your house, you can tell whether the local weather around your home deviates from the state-wide average.</p>
<p>You can easily measure humidity using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DOQAUS-Hygrometer-Thermometer-Temperature-Hygrometer-Black/dp/B07ZSF5RC5?crid=1F15PSE8H9GGH&amp;keywords=hygrometer&amp;qid=1689581410&amp;sprefix=hygromete%2Caps%2C177&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;linkId=cba4c204523b5da3a9acc3e05d5ac963&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">hygrometer (click here to view it on amazon)</a>.</p>
<p>For example, where I live, there is vastly different climate than in the other parts of my state. That’s because my home is in an area with small mountains and a lot of forest.</p>
<p>When I watch weather forecasts, I can immediately tell that the temperature at my home is going to be at least 5°F cooler.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatively:</strong> You can also check your city-specific climate online. I like to use <a href="https://weather.com/">weather.com</a>. Enter your city in the search box and view the weather table.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-interpret-humidity-readings-for-swamp-cooler-effectivity">How to interpret humidity readings for swamp cooler effectivity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-interpret-humidity-readings-for-swamp-cooler-effectivity">#</a></h3>
<p>Once you have the humidity readings of your hygrometer (or the weather website), you can judge whether a swamp cooler is worth getting.</p>
<p>Here’s the golden swamp cooler rule:</p>
<p>“A swamp cooler is worth running if the humidity reaches 50% or lower over the course of a day”</p>
<p>So, even if mornings are very humid in your area (as they are in most places), a swamp cooler is still worth getting if the humidity decreases during the hot hours of the day.</p>
