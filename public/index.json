[{"content":"You can use a diesel heater indoors, in your house, in a garage, shed, or workshop. All you need is a reliable, weatherproof diesel heater setup.\nDiesel heaters can make great emergency heaters. With just a car battery and some diesel, you can heat your home in case of an electricity outage.\nOr, for tiny houses or cabins, diesel heaters can even be reliable long-term heaters.\nIn this guide, we’re having a look at how to properly set up a diesel heater for indoor heating.\nFirst, we’re going to have a look at the different parts of a diesel heater and where you should install them to heat your house. For that, we’re comparing inside and outside placements for the heater. One is clearly safer.\nAfter that, we’re going to check out different sizes of diesel heaters and which best suits your home.\nAnd lastly, we’re going to compare diesel heaters with gas heaters for indoor heating and see some of their shortcomings, but also their advantages!\nSo, let’s jump right in.\nWhich Parts of a Diesel Heater Are Always Indoors / Outdoors? A newly packaged diesel heater comes with many different parts. For this article, we’ll focus on the most important ones that are critical for indoor heating.\nThe biggest part is the diesel heater itself. The diesel heater contains the electronic thermostat controls that monitor and adjust the burn rate. Also, it contains a fuel tank and a small fuel pump moving the diesel fuel between the tank and the combustion chamber.\nA diesel heater has two main opening components: the hot air vent facing into the space you’re heating, and the exhaust side, which leads to exhaust fumes outdoors.\nActually, there are 4 openings, two for each of these sides.\nSince the hot air vent blows hot air, it has to let in air from somewhere. That makes the (indoor) cold air inlet necessary. Just like a fan, one side sucks in air, the other side blows out air.\nThe hot air vent and the air inlet are always located indoors.\nAnd since the exhaust blows fumes out, it has to suck in air as well. For that, there is an outdoor air intake pipe.\nThe exhaust and the air intake are always outdoors.\nSo, to sum this up:\nThe indoor vents (hot air vent and air inlet) and the outdoor exhaust (exhaust and air intake) are fixed in place. Or rather, their end is fixed. The hot air vent always has to be inside, while the exhaust opening always has to be outside.\nThe key question is now: Is it wiser to set up the diesel heater indoors and lay out pipes to lead the exhaust gases outside? Or is it better to set up the diesel heater outdoors and install pipes to lead the hot air vent inside?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll answer this in the next section.\nA typical diesel heater setup: The hot air vent has a large hose attached that leads the air toward the space to be heated. The exhaust (metal pipe below the heater) leads outdoors.\nShould the Diesel Heater be outside or inside? Let’s have a look at the two different possible diesel heater setups for heating your house.\n1. Diesel Heater Indoors / Exhaust Pipe Leads Fumes Outdoors The first option is to have the diesel heater unit inside, with the exhaust and intake pipe connected to the outside. Essentially, this means that the diesel combustion takes place indoors and waste gases are led outdoors.\nAdvantages Energy efficiency: Since the combustion takes place indoors, there is little waste heat. Always weatherproof: The diesel heater standing indoors is always protected from weather and corrosion. Disadvantages Unsafe diesel fumes: Diesel heaters are never 100% perfectly sealed. Exhaust fumes will leak, which can be very unpleasant and unhealthy. This can be acceptable in an imperfectly sealed place such as a garage or a workshop. But it is not suitable for heating a living space. Noise: The diesel heater will be noisy. 2. Diesel Heater Outdoors / Hot Air Vent Pipe Feeds Hot Air Indoors The second possible setup for heating an indoor space with a diesel heater is to place the heater outdoors and connect the hot air vent via pipes to the indoors.\nAdvantages No fumes: If only the hot air vent connects to the indoors, you’ll get 100% clean, hot air. Reduced noise: With the diesel heater placed outdoors, there will be less noise. Disadvantages Needs weatherproofing: You have to ensure the diesel heater is placed in a weatherproof place, under a roof, or in a box. Reduced energy efficiency: On the way through the hot air vent pipe, some heat is lost. The only sustainable approach to indoor heating is, in my opinion, placing the diesel heater outdoors and feeding the hot air into the indoor space you want to heat.\nThis is the only way to completely avoid sealing issues that can lead to toxic fume emissions indoors. Place the source of unpleasant diesel fumes outdoors, and you have nothing to worry about.\nAlso, solving the weatherproofing and reduced energy efficiency (when the heater unit is placed outdoors) is easier than solving noise exposure and toxic gas leaks.\nThe ideal diesel heater setup for indoor heating is to place the diesel heater outside and feed the hot air indoors via pipes.\nThis is the ideal setup for diesel heater indoor heating: Place the diesel heater outside. Connect the indoor hot air vent via a pipe to the space you want to heat. The air inlet also needs to be connected for maximum efficiency and to ensure the heater only blows clean air inside.\nHow to Setup the Diesel Heater for Indoor Heating Setting up the diesel heater can vary a lot depending on your individual situation and you might have to adapt some of the steps.\nHere’s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:\n1. Choose the Location Identify the ideal outdoor spot for your diesel heater. Look for areas like a porch or a shed close to your house. Ensure it’s easily accessible for maintenance and close enough to effectively heat your desired area. If your chosen spot is already sheltered from the elements, like a covered porch, you might not need additional weatherproofing.\n2. Install Weatherproofing Measures If the location isn’t naturally sheltered, protect your diesel heater with a weatherproof box or cover. Look for materials like heavy-duty plastic or rust-resistant metal. Ensure the cover has proper ventilation to avoid overheating.\nOne box you can use is this Rubbermaid outdoor storage box. It should be more than large enough to fit most diesel heaters.\n3. Connect the Heater to the Power Source Securely connect your heater to a power source. For portable use, a high-capacity car battery is suitable. If available, opt for a dedicated electrical connection. Ensure the power source is stable and has the appropriate voltage and amperage for your heater.\n4. Install Exhaust and Air Intake Pipes Use high-temperature resistant pipes for the exhaust, such as stainless steel or aluminum. Attach the exhaust pipe securely to the heater, leading it outdoors.\nOf course, that is only necessary if the heater is inside a box or a shed. If you place the heater on the porch, there’s no need for an exhaust pipe.\nFor the air intake, use a pipe that’s durable and weather-resistant. Ensure both pipes are well-secured and free from any bends or kinks.\n5. Route the Hot Air Vent Pipe Indoors For routing the hot air vent pipe indoors, you’ll need to drill a hole in your wall. Use a hole saw drill bit that matches the pipe’s diameter.\nInsulate the pipe with high-grade thermal insulation material to prevent heat loss. For insulating the hot air vent pipe, I recommend the \u0026quot; Frost King Foil Backed Fiberglass Pipe Wrap.\u0026quot; This insulation is specifically designed for high-temperature applications and is ideal for wrapping around hot air vent pipes. It comes with a foil backing that reflects heat, ensuring minimal heat loss.\nBefore passing the pipe through the drilled hole, wrap it with the insulating pipe wrap. Make sure the foil side faces outward, and secure it with the adhesive strip provided. This will ensure efficient heat transfer into your indoor space.\nCarefully feed the insulated pipe through the hole from the outside. Once the pipe is in place, use a high-quality sealant, like silicone caulk or expanding foam, to seal any gaps around the pipe where it enters the wall. This prevents drafts and moisture from entering.\n6. Test the System Run your heater and check all connections for leaks. Use a carbon monoxide detector near the vent inside to ensure no harmful gases are entering. Confirm that the exhaust is venting properly outdoors and the indoor space is being heated effectively.\nBy following these steps, you can safely and efficiently set up a diesel heater for indoor heating, ensuring a warm and comfortable environment during colder months.\nWhich Size Diesel Heater To Pick to Heat Indoors? To heat your indoor space (inside a house, a garage, shed, etc.) you, of course, need a diesel heater.\nLikely you already have one. But if you don’t, let’s have a look at which diesel heater would be suitable for your use case.\nGenerally, for home heating, I recommend the following two diesel heater sizes:\n5kW: A 5kW is strong enough to heat an entire apartment. Of course, the room connected to the heater’s hot air vent is going to be the warmest. For most cases, 5kW is going to be enough. 5kW can heat apartments, garages and workshops.\nMy recommendation is this 5kW LF Bros diesel heater, because it comes with an adapter, so you can even run it off a regular wall outlet. It is also compatible with car batteries. 8kW: If you’re looking for a whole-house emergency heater, get an 8kW diesel heater. I don’t recommend 2kW diesel heaters. These are usually designed to heat camper vans, but not indoor spaces.\nIf you already have a diesel heater, don’t bother buying a new one. Test with your diesel heater first and see if it produces enough heat. If so, great. If not, come back and read this section again!\nDiesel Heater vs Electric / Gas Heaters: Which is Better Indoors? Usually, diesel heaters are used in RVs or tents. They are not intended for indoor heating. That’s the reason this article exists. So, how do diesel heaters compare with actual indoor heaters? Are there any reasons to prefer an indoor-specific heater over a diesel heater?\nNot really.\nThe main difference between a diesel heater and an indoor-safe heater is the ease of setup. Diesel heaters require electric wiring and piping, while most indoor space heaters require only a wall outlet or a gas tank to run.\nDiesel heaters are very safe to use indoors. With the diesel heater installed properly, it won’t emit carbon monoxide or other dangerous gases into your space. It is a 100% smell-free.\nWhile propane or natural gas-based heaters produce moist air, diesel heaters produce completely dry heat, which can be a huge advantage in humid environments.\nAlso, diesel heaters are highly temperature resistant and can work in extreme cold. They do, however, require some winterization to prevent fuel gelling.\nA diesel heater is safe for indoor heating if it is installed properly.\nThese two articles are worth reading for a detailed comparison:\nDiesel heaters vs propane heaters Diesel heater vs electric heaters: This comparison was written for RV heating, but the key differences still apply. Conclusion To use a diesel heater indoors, place it outdoors and route the hot air vent pipe indoors. This setup provides maximum safety, minimizes noise, and eliminates potential smells coming off the diesel heater.\nTo maximize the efficiency, insulate the hot air vent using an insulation wrap.\nThe ideal diesel heater sizes for indoor heating are 5kW or 8kW, depending on the size of your space. 2kW heaters can work for small spaces, but are unlikely to yield great results, because of the high relative heat loss from the hot air vent pipe.\nCompared to an electric or gas-based indoor heater, diesel heaters are harder to set up. But once a diesel heater is installed, it is a 100% smell-free source of dry heat.\nThis makes the installation effort well worth it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-use-a-diesel-heater-indoors/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou can use a diesel heater indoors, in your house, in a garage, shed, or workshop.

Especially in the US. That’s because US home circuits are laid out to supply 120 Volts. Combined with a 15 Ampere fuse, that corresponds to a maximum power consumption of\n120 Volts × 15 Amps = 1,800 Watts\nSo, the average US household circuit can support 1,800 Watts. But since you want to run multiple devices simultaneously, and not just a single heater, space heaters cap at 1,500 Watts.\nThat’s the story behind the 1,500 Watts limit.\nBut, of course, if you take the time to have a closer look, there are a few space heaters that output more than 1,500 Watts of heat.\nI’ve picked some for you.\nWhich Space Heaters Output More Than 1,500 Watts? Looking for space heaters over 1,500 Watts, they are really hard to find. Indoor household space heaters max out at 1,500 Watts. So, to find space heaters over 1,500 Watts, we have to shift the search a bit.\nThere are two types of heaters that are stronger than 1,500 Watts:\nHeavy-duty electric heaters: These electric heaters usually require a hardwire installation by an electrician, because you have to “workaround” the limitations of the standard US circuit. Heavy-duty electric heaters are costly to install and run. Fuel-based heaters (Gas, Diesel, Wood): Fuel-based space heaters are not limited by the electric grid’s capacity. Gas and diesel heaters can easily output over 5,000 Watts. Wood stoves are even stronger. In this article, we’ll first check out some electric space heaters stronger than 1,500 Watts (which is probably what you were looking for). You will see that these are suboptimal heaters in many cases because they are just so freaking expensive.\nThen, we’ll complete the list with two propane gas heaters that output 5,000 Watts and 8,000 Watts respectively. If you haven’t considered gas heaters before, now is the opportunity to do so.\nSo, let’s have a look at these extra-strong heaters and what you need to do to be able to run them:\nElectric Space Heaters Stronger than 1,500 Watts 1. Comfort Zone CZ220 (5,000 Watts) The Comfort Zone CZ220 (click to view it on amazon) is a powerful 5,000-watt garage heater.\nI ranked this one the #1 electric heater over 1,500 Watts because it is very durable. The full steel case protects it from heat and impact.\nI wouldn’t be surprised if this heater lasts you 20 years or more.\nIt is a very strong heater. But because it outputs so much heat, you can’t run it off an ordinary wall outlet. The Comfort Zone CZ220 needs a hardwire installation into a single-phase 240 Volt circuit. Most people hire an electrician to install it for them.\nOnce it’s installed, the Comfort Zone heater is practically maintenance-free. Since it runs on electricity alone, it never needs refills (like a fuel-based heater). And because the only moving part inside it is a fan, the only noise it creates is a blowing noise.\n2. NewAir G56 (5,600 Watts) This one is a bit cheaper than the comfort zone, but you cannot ceiling-mount it as nicely. My second recommendation is the NewAir G56 (click to view it on amazon).\nOverall, it doesn’t really matter whether you get the Comfort Zone or this one. It’s just a small price difference. Both are hardwired heaters. The Comfort Zone is, however, better rated.\nYou can’t really do anything wrong with either of them.\nJust pick the one you like most.\nHow Expensive are 5,000 Watt Electric Heaters To Run? To be honest, while writing these recommendations, I feel the need to emphasize something.\nElectric space heaters are very expensive to run. Even a regular-sized 1,500 Watts heater costs you over $50 a month if you run it for 8 hours a day, every day.\nSo, a 5,000-watt heater, which is about 3 to 4 times as strong as a regular space heater, will give you a hefty electricity bill of $150 - $200 if you run it for 8 hours every day.\nA single hour of 5,000 Watt-heating will cost you $0.85 (assuming an average electricity rate of 17 cents per kWh).\nAnd, in my opinion, that is rarely a reasonable decision. Please only get an electric heavy-duty space heater (stronger than 1,500 Watts) if you are absolutely sure there’s no better option.\nIf I made you doubt your own decision, good.\nElectric heaters are rarely the best choice for heating. Instead, a small wood stove, or a natural gas (NG) or liquid propane (LP) heater is usually better.\nSo, let’s continue with my real recommendations for strong heaters.\nPropane Heaters Stronger Than 1,500 Watt Space Heaters I really enjoy using propane heaters. They output well above 1,500 Watts of heating power. A small, portable propane heater is usually up to 3x as strong as a regular electric space heater. And running a propane heater costs just a fraction of the running cost of an electric heater.\nHere are my propane heater recommendations:\n3. Mr. Heater Big Buddy (18,000 BTU/h = 5,250 Watts) The Mr. Heater Big Buddy (click to view it on amazon) is my favorite portable propane heater. It outputs 18,000 BTU (British Thermal Units) per hour, which is equivalent to 5,250 Watts.\nThe biggest advantage of the Mr. Heater Big Buddy, when compared to an electric space heater is that it does not require any installation. It does not even need electricity to run, which makes it a great emergency heater.\nAnd another advantage is, of course, the reduced running cost.\nHeat from propane gas is about 70% cheaper than heat from electricity.\nHowever, beware that burning propane gas produces some humidity. So, with a propane heater, you will have to vent regularly.\n4. Dyna-Glo Wall-mounted Heater (30,000 BTU/h = 8,800 Watts) This Dyna-Glo wall-mounted heater (click to see it on amazon) is a very powerful propane heater. Its heat output is 30,000 BTU/h, which is equivalent to 8,800 Watts.\nSo, this one is great for everybody looking to heat large or uninsulated spaces, such as garages, basements, or workshops.\nSince this model is wall-mounted, it takes up no floor space, which I particularly like.\nAlso, just like the Mr. Heater Big Buddy, the Dyna-Glo requires no installation, aside from mounting it to the wall and hooking it up with a propane tank.\nIt runs completely without electricity, which makes it a worthy emergency heater. Just like the Mr. Heater Big Buddy, you will need to vent occasionally to get rid of humidity from the propane combustion.\nDiesel Heaters Diesel heaters are also stronger than 1,500 Watts. However, since they are usually used in RVs (camper vans, motorhomes, etc.), I decided not to list them here explicitly.\nIf you’re interested in diesel heaters, check out this guide on RV diesel heaters.\nWood Stoves Of all heaters that output more than 1,500 Watts, a wood stove is probably the most obvious one.\nWhen I was trekking in the Himalayas, the locals fired up their wood stoves to temperatures to sauna-like temperatures for one hour a day to dry out their homes.\nWood stoves involve a lot of work, most of which is firewood chopping, stacking, and drying. Good quality wood is what separates a good, efficient burn from a wood-devouring waste of money.\nFor you, looking for a strong heater, a wood heater is probably not what you want. But if you are interested, have a look at my guide on the best tiny house heaters, where I recommend a small wood stove.\nConclusion Electric heaters stronger than 1,500 Watts are expensive to run. My #1 recommendation is the 5,000-watt Comfort Zone CZ220 garage heater. It outputs a full 5,000 Watts.\nHowever, be aware that heavy-duty electric heating is very expensive and can cost you several hundred dollars a month, depending on usage.\nIf you can avoid getting such an electric heater, get a propane heater instead. Their heat output is not limited by your home’s electric circuitry. Propane heaters safely output very high heat levels. On a propane heater, 1,500 Watts is the “low” setting, while regular household space heaters max out at 1,500 Watts.\nAnd on top of that, propane heat is much cheaper than electric heat.\nOverall, propane heaters are generally the better choice of space heater type when you need a lot of heat.\nYou need to evaluate your situation and see which space heater over 1,500 Watts suits you better: An electric heater over 1,500 Watts that requires professional installation, but no refills, or a propane heater that requires no installation but needs propane tank refills.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/space-heaters-over-1500-watts/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSpace heaters are usually limited to 1,500 Watts.

This post is about the results.\nWhen you look for diesel heater amperages online, you don’t get any good answers. One website I found said that “diesel heater draws 1 amp per hour”. As an electrical engineer, hearing this hurts my brain. Severely.\nThat’s as if I say that my car uses 100 horsepower per hour. It’s just a nonsensical use of the unit.\nI know the comparison isn’t exactly right, since amps are flow units and hp are power units.\nBut you get the point.\nLet’s have a look at how many amps a diesel heater really uses.\nHow many Amps does a Diesel Heater use? A diesel heater’s amperage profile consists of 3 phases: startup, during heating, and shutoff.\nDuring each phase, diesel heaters do something interesting. Let’s see:\nDuring Startup During startup, a diesel heater draws 8 - 12 Amps.\nThe main consumer of the high amperage is the glow plug, which is responsible for initiating the combustion.\nThe glow plug is essentially an electric resistive heater that draws full amperage until the fuel ignites and the combustion chamber reaches a set operating temperature.\nOnce the operating temperature is reached, the diesel heater senses that and shuts off the glow plug.\nThe startup phase, in which the glow plug is turned on, usually takes 3-4 minutes. In very cold conditions it can be up to 5 minutes.\nThe glow plug is responsible for the most current draw.\nWhile Heating Once the operating temperature is reached, the glow plug turns off and stops drawing electric power.\nWhile heating, 3 other consumers are the main power consumers:\nBuilt-in fan: The built-in fan consumes between 0.25 Amps on the lowest and 2 Amps on the highest fan speed setting. Fuel pump: The fuel pump also draws a current. But it’s not straightforward to extract a separate amperage for the fuel pump. Likely, it’s around 0.2 Amps on the lowest and around 0.5 Amps on a higher setting. Onboard Electronics: The built-in electronics, such as the thermostat, draw negligible current. I’d estimate 20mA. Again, this cannot be easily measured. While heating, diesel heaters consume anywhere between 0.25 - 2 Amps, depending on the fan and pump settings.\nWhen Shutting Off Here’s where it gets interesting. When shutting a diesel heater off, the amperage goes up again, rising slowly from 3A to 10A.\nThis is counterintuitive because a diesel heater shouldn’t draw electric current during shutoff, should it?\nBut, as it turns out, diesel heaters turn on the glow plug when they shut off to vaporize all fuel and grease.\nIn that sense, after operation, during the shutoff, diesel heaters self-clean.\nWithout the glow plug turning on again, the oily grease on the glow plug would harden which causes startup problems the next time you use your diesel heater.\nIt’s easier to vaporize all grease while it’s still fresh, instead of waiting for the next time you use the heater.\nAfter the glow plug is done drawing up to 10 Amps to self-clean, the amperage drops to 0 Amps.\nThis phase can take anywhere between 1-5 minutes, depending on dirt accumulation and outdoor temperature.\nUseful to Know: Why You Shouldn’t Turn On And Off Your Diesel Heater Often Because diesel heaters draw a lot of current during startup and shutoff phases, I wonder how much electric energy (in %) is used during these phases.\nLet’s assume the following:\nstartup phase: 3 minutes at 10 Amps heating phase: 8 hours at 0.5 Amps shutoff phase: 3 minutes at 10 Amps I did the calculations and here’s my result:\nBased on the provided information, the electric energy used during each phase of the diesel heater\u0026rsquo;s operation is distributed as follows:\nStartup Phase: 10% of the total energy Heating Phase: 80% of the total energy Shutoff Phase: 10% of the total energy So, the startup and shutoff phases combined consume 20% of the total electric energy, while the heating phase consumes 80%. ​The combined startup and shutoff phases account for approximately 1.23% of the total operation time.\nEven though the startup and shutoff phase account for only ~1% of the diesel heater operation time, they consume 20% of the electric energy.\nTurning on and off your diesel heater is a major waste of electric energy. So, carefully evaluate whether it makes more sense to leave the heater running or not in your situation.\nStartup and shutoff phases drain the battery. Minimize them.\nWhat if You Can’t Supply That Amperage? If your current power setup can’t supply the necessary amperage for a diesel heater, especially during startup and shutoff phases, you have a few alternatives to consider.\nOption 1: Additional Car Battery Using a Dedicated Car Battery Dedicated Battery: Consider getting an extra car battery dedicated to the diesel heater. This ensures that your vehicle’s main battery isn’t drained. Parallel Connection: Connect this additional battery in parallel with your main battery. This arrangement increases the available amperage without changing the voltage. Free Standing: Alternatively, you could have the extra battery as a standalone system, solely for the heater. This avoids any potential drain on your vehicle’s main battery. I recommend getting this ACDelco truck battery (click to view it on amazon), because it has a high capacity and thus lasts a longer time without needing to be recharged.\nOption 2: Diesel Generator Using a diesel generator to power a diesel heater might seem like a logical step, but it’s not always practical or efficient. Generators are typically designed for higher power outputs and may not be cost-effective or convenient for this purpose. Also, the noise and fuel requirements for a generator could be a downside compared to using a dedicated battery setup.\nOption 3: Propane Heater as an Alternative If managing the amperage requirements for a diesel heater is too cumbersome, consider switching to a propane heater.\nPortable propane heaters don’t need any electricity. They can be a good alternative, especially in situations where electrical power is limited.\nHowever, always compare the efficiency, cost, and practicality of propane heaters in your specific use case before making a decision.\nI recommend having a look at this guide: Diesel vs Propane Heater (5 Differences)\nConclusion In conclusion, while diesel heaters are efficient and effective, their electrical demands during startup and shutoff phases can be a challenge, especially in setups with limited power availability.\nExploring alternatives like an additional car battery, or even switching to a different type of heater, such as a propane heater, can offer practical solutions.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-many-amps-does-a-diesel-heater-use/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI did an experiment, measuring the amperage of my diesel heater.

No cleaning: Since there’s no constant stream of air passing through the heater, it does not accumulate dust, and, therefore, does not need cleaning or built-in air filters. Silence: Fanless heaters are 100% silent. Based on these findings, we can already tell that maintenance-wise and technology-wise, fanless heaters are superior to most other electric space heaters.\nTechnically, they are flawless.\nOr are they?\nIn this article, we’re having a look at 4 of the best fanless electric space heaters. And we’re also going to have a look at the downsides of space heaters without fans.\nNot having a fan is usually, but not always, an advantage. So, let’s start with a note first:\nNot having a built-in fan is NOT a Safety Advantage If you want a fanless heater for safety concerns, then you’re looking for the wrong thing.\nThe fans in most space heaters are completely inaccessible from the outside unless you deliberately poke a stick through the safety grid down into the heater.\nBut the chance of chopping your finger off is close to zero. Fans in space heaters are not safety concerns.\nBy coincidence, however, the very safest space heaters, oil-filled radiators, do not have built-in fans. I don’t consider them the safest space heaters because they are fanless, but because they have no exposed heating element.\nSo, if you want the safest possible space heater, you maybe should have a look at this guide on the safest space heaters.\nAnd if you’re looking for child and pet-safe space heaters, look at this guide on the best child-safe space heaters.\nI emphasize this because infrared heaters, especially fanless ones, rely on exposed (easily accessible) heating elements to radiate the heat. Consequently, especially fanless heaters are to be taken with a grain of salt if your sole goal is to pick a safe heater.\nFanless heaters can be either very safe (such as oil radiators), or very unsafe (such as infrared heaters with exposed heating elements). There is no correlation between heater safety and the presence of a built-in fan.\nWhen to pick a fanless heater? Okay, then why should you even care about getting a fanless heater, if it’s not for safety?\nThe answer is: You should pick a fanless heater if you care about 100% silent and maintenance-free heating.\nAnd for many people, that’s already enough of a reason to get one.\nSo, let’s have a look at my recommended fanless heaters:\n4 Best Fanless Heaters 1. DeLonghi Dragon oil-filled radiator The best fanless heater is the DeLonghi Dragon oil-filled radiator (click here to see it on amazon).\nIt has all the advantages of a fanless heater: It is 100% silent and never requires cleaning or maintenance.\nAnd on top of that, it is the safest form of fanless heater: an oil-filled radiator.\nOil radiators are very safe because they do not expose the built-in heating element. The heat source is completely inaccessible from the outside and embedded inside the sealed metal heating body, where it’s drowned in oil.\nThe hot oil then carries all the heat to the finned surface which converts it to hot air, which self-distributes, completely without a fan.\nEven though oil-filled radiators output the same heat as other space heaters (1,500 Watts), they are safe to touch and can’t start fires.\nOne thing I like a lot about the DeLonghi Dragon, and that’s why I ranked it as the best fanless heater, is its smooth and edgeless design. Regular oil-filled radiators have a finned design (the classic radiator look) with sharp edges. The DeLonghi Dragon uses an original thermal slot design which is child and pet-safe.\nAnd that’s what makes it better than most other oil-filled radiators.\n2. Pelonis Oil-filled Radiator The second-best fanless space heater is this Pelonis oil-filled radiator (click to view it on amazon).\nPelonis is my personal favorite radiator brand, because they are really affordable, especially when compared with brand products such as DeLonghi heaters.\nThis Pelonis oil heater costs just half as much as the DeLonghi Dragon. And, I’d say, for most people, the Pelonis is going to be the better choice cost-wise.\nHere’s why:\nPelonis oil-filled radiators lack (almost) nothing. They are just as silent as DeLonghi radiators. They output the same heat. And they come with all the same technical safety features such as tip-over protection, overheat protection, a built-in timer, and a thermostat.\nBUT the Pelonis oil-filled radiator still has the classic oil-filled radiator design, with its sharp fins. Technically, this design is ideal for heat distribution. But it’s not great when you have kids.\nI wouldn’t want my child banging his head against it a metal fin.\nAnd that’s why I put the DeLonghi Dragon on rank #1. But overall, if you don’t have children who will bang their heads against the heater, I highly recommend the Pelonis heater.\nAt just a fraction of the cost, you get the exact same heating experience as with any more expensive branded heater.\n3. Heat Storm Tradesman Infrared Heater Okay, that’s enough oil-filled radiator recommendations. In the introduction, we also discovered that infrared heaters can be fanless. However, there’s a drawback.\nInfrared heaters produce very hot temperatures. And because they rely on direct heat radiation, the infrared heating tubes have to be exposed.\nSo, by technical necessity, fanless infrared heaters need to have an open design. Otherwise, the infrared heat can’t escape and infrared heaters would overheat.\nThat’s not the case for infrared heaters with fans. With a built-in fan, infrared heaters can blow the heat away from the infrared heating tubes and cool themselves.\nAnyway, here’s my recommendation for a strong 1,500-watt fanless infrared heater: The Heat Storm HS-1500-OTR infrared heater(click to view it on amazon).\nAs the name suggests, it is a “pure” infrared heater. It has an industrial look to it, because, as explained earlier, the infrared tubes must be as exposed as possible to make the heater work without a fan.\nI have linked the option which comes with a ceiling mount, because I like to keep my floor space free. But you can also choose the tripod variant if you want to freely place the heater wherever you like it.\n4. Small Fanless Infrared Heater My last recommendation is this small infrared heater (click to view it on amazon). It’s a fanless, free-standing space heater.\nBecause it’s fanless and free-standing, it is, however, limited to 500 Watts oif heat output.\nSo, compared to the other heaters on this list, this one is significantly weaker.\nBut if having no fan is a requirement for you, that’s the way it is. Without a fan to dissipate heat, many infrared heaters have to size down. Otherwise, they’d overheat.\nI have a similar 800 Watt infrared space heater at home. And it is strong enough to keep a small room such as a small office warm.\nAnd even though it’s comparably weak, the infrared tubes still get very hot (\u0026gt;900°F). So, the closer you place it to yourself, the warmer you’ll feel.\nWhat’s the better fanless heater: Oil-filled or Infrared Heater? Let’s keep the answer to this simple. If you’re looking for a safe, fanless heater, oil-filled radiators are always the better option.\nThey do not expose heating elements, they output a full 1,500 Watts of heat, and they are reliable.\nFanless infrared heaters are usually either very small models (~500 Watts), because without a fan that blows the heat away, it’s safer to output less heat, or they are large 1,500 Watt heaters, but with very exposed heating elements and an industrial look and feel to them.\nFor living spaces, oil-filled radiators are always the better fanless choice. Fanless infrared heaters are only good in garages and workshops.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-fanless-heaters/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFanless heaters have several advantages when compared to regular electric space heaters:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo wear-down:\u003c/strong\u003e Since they have no built-in fan, they don’t wear down over time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo maintenance:\u003c/strong\u003e Since they contain no moving parts, they are maintenance-free.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo cleaning:\u003c/strong\u003e Since there’s no constant stream of air passing through the heater, it does not accumulate dust, and, therefore, does not need cleaning or built-in air filters.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSilence:\u003c/strong\u003e Fanless heaters are 100% silent.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on these findings, we can already tell that maintenance-wise and technology-wise, fanless heaters are superior to most other electric space heaters.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"4 Best Fanless Heaters"},{"content":"Your (chinese) diesel heater shows an E08 error code? No problem. The E08 error code is usually simple to fix requires no tools and no disassembly, and takes under 5 minutes.\nIn this article, we’re having a look at the most common reasons and fixes for the E08 error.\nIf you follow this article closely, you will be able to resolve the error code within the next few minutes.\nWe’ll keep it simple \u0026amp; easy.\nLet’s dive right in.\nWhat does the E08 Error mean? The E08 error code means that the flame has gone out because your heater does not receive any fuel.\nSometimes, diesel heaters mistakenly interpret an extinguished flame as lack of fuel.\nLet’s have a look at how to troubleshoot the E08 error.\nHow to fix the E08 Error Code The E08 error shows when your heater does not receive enough / any fuel. This can be either because the fuel tank is empty, or because something prevents the fuel from getting from the tank to your diesel heater.\nLet’s have a look at the different cases, starting with the easiest:\n1. Refuel Tank / Check for Leaks The first possible reason is that your fuel tank is empty. When the tank is empty, no fuel can reach the combustion chamber, and your heater displays the E08 error.\nHow to fix it Check your fuel tank.\nIf you recently refilled it, and you discover it empty, check your fuel tank for leaks. If you find one, either seal it or get a new tank.\nAlso, make sure that the diesel in your tank is not gelling. Diesel fuel turns to a gel when it is cold outside. This can prevent your heater from receiving any fuel. You can prevent gelling by adding anti-gel additive.\nOnce that’s done, refill it, restart the heater, and the E08 error should be gone.\nYou might have to re-prime the pump. Check your user manual on how to do it.\nHow to Prime the Pump on a Diesel Heater If you\u0026rsquo;re facing an E08 error with your diesel heater, priming the pump can often resolve it. Here’s how to do it on most diesel heater models:\nEnter Priming Mode: Press “OK” and “Down” together. The display will show “H oF”. Activate Pump: Change “H oF” to “H oN” by pressing “Up”. This starts the priming. Wait for Priming: Let it run for 1-2 minutes until the “H oN” blinks. Turn Off Priming: Switch back to “H oF” and press “OK” to exit. Start Heater: Press the power button to turn on the heater. If the description doesn’t match your diesel heater, for example, if you have “left” and “right” arrow buttons instead of up and down, check your user manual for how to do it. Or just follow the instructions, but map the button names to fit the buttons on your heater model.\nFor example: Instead of pressing “OK” and “Down” together, try pressing “OK” and “Right” together, or “OK” and “Left”. You can figure out which buttons on your heater correspond to the buttons in this description. Whatever gets you to the “H oF” screen, is the correct combination.\nThis process helps clear air from the fuel lines, prepping your heater for efficient operation.\n2. Windproof the Heater Exhaust Diesel heaters are subject to weather changes and they are not completely resistant to wind.\nWind blowing into the exhaust pipe can put out the flame in your diesel heater. The onboard electronics of your heater mistake this for a lack of fuel and display the E08 error code.\nHow to fix it First of all, restart your diesel heater and see if it works. If it does, great. If it doesn’t, re-prime it and try again.\nAlso, consider making your diesel heater more wind-resistant. Place the exhaust pipe orifice of your heater in a way that wind does not easily blow into it.\nOr, alternatively, if you don’t want to change your setup, and you’re using your diesel heater in a car, van, or truck, adjust your parking position to make the heater exhaust orifice face away from the wind.\n3. Enlarge Hole in Tank Cap The third possible cause of your heater showing the E08 error code is when your tank is full and no fuel reaches the heater.\nThis usually happens when pressure builds up in the tank.\nWhen the pump pumps diesel from the tank to the heater, it leaves a negative pressure in the tank.\nUsually, a small hole in the tank cap allows air to enter the tank, which equalizes the pressure again.\nBut if that hole is too small, or it is obstructed, a vacuum builds up in your diesel tank, which prevents the fuel pump from being able to pump diesel.\nHow to fix it Take the tank cap off your fuel tank. While unscrewing the tank cap, you should hear a hissing sound from air entering the tank, which indicates that there is a negative pressure buildup inside the tank.\nInspect the tank cap. There should be a small hole in it. Often, there are rubber parts around the cap for leak insulation. Make sure these don’t obstruct the small air hole.\nTo prevent the issue in the future, enlarge the hole in your tank cap with a knife or a pair of scissors.\nIn any case, restart the heater, and see if it works now. If necessary, prime the pump as described earlier.\nWhat to do if you can’t solve the E08 error code? Usually, the E08 is simple to fix. But the issue in your heater could be more severe, for example, a broken fuel pump.\nI recommend checking out this diesel heater repair guide because it contains more detailed troubleshooting steps.\nAnd, if you keep having problems with your diesel heater, maybe it’s time to switch to a propane heater. I find propane heaters are much simpler to run, without any error codes, and they last a lot longer without wearing down.\nConclusion The E08 error code on diesel heaters means that no fuel reaches the combustion chamber. Either you ran out of fuel, the wind blew out the flame, or there’s pressure buildup in the tank, which blocks fuel flow.\nIn any case, the E08 error code is nothing to worry about and anyone can fix it without tools.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fix-diesel-heater-e08-error-code/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour (chinese) diesel heater shows an E08 error code?

It\u0026rsquo;s all about staying warm and cozy.\nA lot of van travelers wonder whether to go with a diesel heater or an electric one. Diesel heaters are great for pumping out a lot of heat, but setting them up and keeping them running takes some work.\nElectric heaters are easier to use and quieter, but they might not give you as much warmth and need a steady electric supply. Which one is better really depends on where and how you plan to use your van.\nIn this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at both diesel and electric heaters for camper vans / motorhomes / and RVs.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll talk about what\u0026rsquo;s good and not so good about each, and when it\u0026rsquo;s best to use one over the other.\nBy the end, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a good idea of which heater fits your van life better and how to make the most of it for staying warm.\nDiesel Heaters for RVs Diesel heaters in RVs work by burning diesel fuel to create heat. This heat is then blown into your RV through a vent, warming up the space. They have a fuel tank, a burner where the diesel gets heated, and a fan to spread the warmth. You control the heat with a thermostat, just like your heater at home.\nWhy you should use a Diesel Heater in your RV Lots of Heat: Depending on the model, diesel heaters output up to 5,000 Watts of heat, which is more than 3 times more heat than a standard 1500W electric heater. Efficient for Off-Grid: While they do use a bit of electricity from your RV\u0026rsquo;s battery, they primarily run on diesel. This makes them ideal for off-grid camping, as they don\u0026rsquo;t rely heavily on electrical hookups. Fuel Usage: On average, a diesel heater might use about 0.1 to 0.3 gallons of diesel per hour, depending on the model and the heat setting. So, over the course of a night (let\u0026rsquo;s say 8 hours), you could expect to use approximately 0.8 to 2.4 gallons of diesel (depending on the heat setting).\nThat’s quite something. But it’s a lot more cost-effective than using expensive electricity! Diesel heater unboxing: A new diesel heater comes with a tank and a set of fuel lines and exhausts.\nDownsides of Diesel Heaters Installation: Setting them up can be a bit of a project since diesel heaters consist of many parts. They need electric connections and you need to layout the exhaust pipe. Luckily, there are many video guides on YouTube you can follow along. Maintenance: Because diesel heaters burn diesel, which is a chemical reaction, diesel heaters need regular checks and cleaning to keep them working well. Otherwise, soot builds up and clogs the airways which reduces heating efficiency or even stops the heater from heating. Noise: Diesel heaters are noisy! There are moving parts inside them that create noise. First and foremost, the fuel pump. But then, there’s also the blower and the combustion chamber. None of which are silent. Best Usage Scenarios for Diesel Heaters Cold Climates: If you’re traveling to really cold places, a diesel heater will keep your RV cozy and warm. You only need to make sure the diesel fuel is prepared for the cold weather. Otherwise, it thickens up which is called “fuel gelling”. Check out this guide on how to reduce diesel fuel gelling. Off-Grid Adventures: When you’re out in nature away from campgrounds or RV parks, these heaters are great because they only need a small amount of electricity to start the diesel combustion process. Aside from that, you can consider diesel heaters offgrid-friendly. Long Trips: For long road trips or full-time RV living, diesel heaters give you a lot of heat for a longer time without needing a refill.\nAlso, storing heat energy is very simple. Just carry an additional diesel tank with you. There’s no need for expensive battery packs etc. In short, diesel heaters are a strong choice for keeping your RV warm, especially when you’re traveling in cold areas or places without electricity.\nRecommended Diesel Heater for RVs To be very honest, most diesel heaters you find online are the same. They are all relatively cheap Chinese-made heaters. But they work. So, it doesn’t really matter which one you pick. The differences between the individual models are very small. Sometimes, it’s only the logo that changes.\nSo, I’d just pick a popular model with a decent rating. So, if the heater ever has a problem, you can easily look it up online:\nMy recommendation is this Vevor diesel heater(click to view it on amazon). It’s a 5kW model, which is more than enough for most regular-sized camper vans and motorhomes. For large motorhomes, just pick the 8kW variant.\nElectric Heaters for RVs Electric heaters in RVs are all about simplicity and convenience. They work by using electricity to heat up a heating element, for example a coil or an infrared tube, which then radiates the heat into your RV.\nElectric heaters are plug-and-play, meaning you just plug them into an electrical outlet in your RV, and they start heating.\nMost come with a thermostat and different heat settings, so you can control the temperature easily.\nWhy You Should Use an Electric Heater in Your RV No installation required: Electric heaters are super user-friendly. Just plug them in, turn them on, and you’re good to go. No complex setup or installation. Completely quiet: Unlike diesel heaters, electric heaters are quiet. They don\u0026rsquo;t have any loud parts like pumps, and thus heat without the noise. Of course, if you pick a heater with a built-in fan, you get some fan noise. But infrared heaters (I’ll recommend you one later), are usually 100% silent. Clean Heating: They don’t burn fuel, so there’s no soot or exhaust to worry about. Fuel Usage: Electric heaters consume electricity, which is a downside if you’re off-grid.\nThe typical electric heater uses around 1,500 Watts of power. So, if you’re using your RV’s battery, it’ll drain quickly.\nHowever, when you’re at a campground with hookups, it’s perfect - you can heat your RV without worrying about refueling or battery drain. Downsides of Electric Heaters Limited Heat Output: Electric heaters max out at 1500 Watts. (Except you’re in Europe. There you can find stronger heaters up to 2,500 Watts)\nSo, electric heaters are not ideal for heating larger spaces or in very cold conditions. Reliance on Electricity: You need a steady supply of electricity. If you’re off-grid, you will need a generator or a large battery bank with an inverter. Best Usage Scenarios for Electric Heaters Mild Climates: In areas where it doesn’t get extremely cold, an electric heater can keep your RV cozy without needing the intense heat of a diesel heater. Short Trips and Campgrounds: Perfect for short trips or when you’re staying at campgrounds with electrical hookups. Supplemental Heat: They’re great as a secondary heat source. Use them to boost warmth along with your RV’s built-in heating system or a diesel heater. Recommended Electric Heater for RVs For electric heaters, the key is finding a balance between size, power, and safety features. My favorite pick is this Heat Storm infrared heater (click to view it on amazon).\nThis one stands out from all other infrared heaters because it comes with a built-in thermostat and auto-mode, which lets the heater completely control itself.\nJust set a temperature, and the Heat Storm will take care. That’s perfect for RVs.\nAnd best of all, the Heat Storm infrared heater is wall-mountable, so it doesn’t take up any floor space.\nIn summary, electric heaters are all about ease and convenience. They’re great for certain situations like staying at campgrounds or in milder weather. Just plug them in, and you have a comfortable, warm RV without much fuss.\nDiesel vs Electric Heaters for RVs: A Side-by-Side Look When it comes to heating your RV, choosing between a diesel and an electric heater involves considering several factors. Here\u0026rsquo;s a straightforward comparison to help you weigh your options:\nHeating Power: Diesel Heaters: Deliver up to 5,000 Watts, making them powerful enough to heat larger spaces and cope with extreme cold. Electric Heaters: Typically offer up to 1,500 Watts (2,500 Watts in Europe), suitable for milder climates and smaller spaces. Where You Get Power From: Diesel Heaters: Run on diesel fuel, which is readily available and ideal for off-grid situations. They do use a small amount of electricity from the RV’s battery for ignition and operation. Electric Heaters: Depend on an electrical source, like a campground hookup or a generator. They\u0026rsquo;re ideal when you have steady access to electricity. Setting Up and Taking Care of Them: Diesel Heaters: Require initial installation, which can be complex. They need regular maintenance like cleaning to prevent soot buildup and to ensure efficient operation. Electric Heaters: Are plug-and-play with no installation needed. Maintenance is minimal, mostly just basic cleaning. How Much They Cost: Diesel Heaters: The upfront cost is usually higher with diesel heaters.A good quality diesel heater can cost anywhere between $150 - $600. Running a diesel heater for one night costs between $2 and $8, depending on the heat setting and the diesel price. Electric Heaters: Typically have a lower upfront cost and cost between $50 - $200. When hooked up at campgrounds, where electricity is often included in the site fee, the running cost can be negligible. Off-grid, electric heater running costs can be high due to the need for a generator or large battery bank.\nIn general, you should plan $1 - $6 per night for electric heaters (accounting for the increased electricity cost at campgrounds and off-grid). But remember that electric heaters output much less heat!

Ideally, the diesel in your heater should always be a liquid.\nIn this article, we’ll have a look at 4 simple ways to prevent diesel gelling in your diesel heater when it’s cold.\nHow to Fix Diesel Heater Fuel Gelling To properly winterize your diesel heater, you can protect your diesel on 3 different levels:\nchemical: using additives and fuel mixes physical: by adding insulation electrical: by adding supply heat 1. Diesel Anti-Gel Additive One of the most effective ways to prevent diesel fuel from gelling in cold weather is by using a diesel anti-gel additive. These additives are specifically formulated to lower the freezing point of diesel fuel, ensuring it remains fluid even in lower temperatures.\nHow It Works: Diesel anti-gel additives contain chemicals that interfere with the wax crystal formation in diesel fuel, which is the primary cause of gelling. By preventing these crystals from forming, the fuel maintains its liquidity.\nOne very popular diesel anti-gel additive is Hot Shot\u0026rsquo;s Secret Diesel Winter Anti-Gel (click to view it on amazon), which reduces fuel-line freezing temperature down to -40°F(!).\nHow to Use: Proper Measurement: The recommended ratio is typically mentioned on the product label. For most conditions, a mix ratio of one ounce of additive per five gallons of diesel is effective. In extremely cold conditions, you might need a stronger mix. Mixing with Fuel: It’s best to add the anti-gel additive to your diesel fuel before filling up your heater’s tank. This ensures thorough mixing. Timing: Add the additive before the onset of freezing temperatures for maximum effectiveness. If the fuel has already gelled, the additive might not work as well. Regular Use in Winter: Begin using the additive at the start of cold weather, before temperatures drop to the point where diesel fuel typically begins to gel. The ideal time to add anti-gel is whenever you’re refueling your diesel heater\u0026rsquo;s tank. Before filling the tank with diesel fuel, pour the recommended amount of additive directly into the empty tank.\n2. Add Kerosene to Diesel Fuel Mixing kerosene with diesel is a time-tested method to prevent fuel gelling in cold weather. Kerosene, with its lower gel point and viscosity, can significantly improve the cold-weather performance of your diesel heater.\nAnd, it’s an alternative to using anti-gel, if kerosene is more accessible to you.\nHow It Works: Kerosene remains fluid at lower temperatures where diesel would start to gel. When you mix diesel with kerosene, the result is a more winter-resistant fuel that ensures smooth flow and operation of your diesel heater.\nHow to Use: Mix Ratio: A common mix ratio is 80% diesel to 20% kerosene for cold weather conditions. However, the colder it gets, the more kerosene you should add. In extremely cold environments, a 50-50 mix might be necessary. Adding to Fuel: When refueling your diesel heater, first add the kerosene to the tank and then fill up with diesel. This order helps in mixing the two fuels more effectively. Quality Check: Ideally, use 1-K grade kerosene, which is cleaner and contains fewer impurities compared to other grades. Considerations: Heater Compatibility: Check your diesel heater’s manual or with the manufacturer to ensure it’s safe to use a diesel-kerosene mix. Most heaters can handle this blend without issues, but it’s always good to confirm. 3. Use a 12V Heating Pad to Pre-Warm Diesel Incorporating a 12V silicone heating pad into your diesel heater setup is an effective way to pre-warm the diesel fuel, especially in extremely cold environments.\nThis method directly combats fuel gelling by maintaining the fuel’s temperature above the gelling point.\nThese 20W silicone heating pads (click to view them on amazon) will work for this.\nHow It Works: The silicone heating pad, when attached to the fuel tank or fuel line, pre-warms the diesel. This keeps it in a liquid state, preventing the formation of wax crystals that lead to gelling.\nHow to Use: Installation: Attach the heating pad to the outside of the diesel fuel tank or along the fuel line. Ensure it’s securely attached and insulated to maximize heat transfer. Electrical Connection: Connect the heating pad to a 12V power source. This can be the same battery powering the diesel heater or a separate one. Timing: Use the heating pad prior to starting the heater. Turn the heating pads off right before you start the heater. Otherwise your diesel heater might not receive enough electric power.\nIn cold conditions, keeping the pad on continuously or on a timer can ensure the diesel remains warm and fluid. Considerations: The biggest drawback of using additional heating pads to keep diesel warm is the constant energy consumption. The heating pads will drain your car battery over time.\nSo, they are not ideal. So, prefer using anti-gel or kerosene over using an additional heat source.\n4. Insulate Fuel Lines Fuel lines that are too cold can cause diesel to gel up while it’s being pumped into the heater.\nThis usually happens when you install the fuel line to pass through a colder part of your vehicle / space that you are heating.\nFor example, a fuel line that passes through an uninsulated part of your van / car / truck (outside the passenger space) will constantly expose diesel to the cold.\nWhat to do: Add some simple insulation to your fuel lines. It can be a simple insulation wrap or a special fuel line heat sleeve, specifically made to insulate fuel lines.\nFuel line heat sleeves are perfect for fuel line insulation. But they only work well if the diesel is pre-heated and it passes through a cold space. If both tank and fuel lines are located in the cold, heat sleeves won\u0026rsquo;t help.\nThe main downside of fuel line insulation is, in my opinion, that insulation obstructs the view of the fuel line. So, if you have transparent fuel lines, you can’t see the diesel flowing through the fuel line anymore.\nA workaround, and even better than insulation, would be to completely restructure your fuel line setup and ensure it only passes through insulated space.\nIf it doesn’t work: Use Propane in Winter These 4 strategies should ensure that the diesel in your diesel heater won’t gel up in winter.\nIf you still have diesel gelling problems, you can circumvent the issue, by using a different kind of heater during wintertime.\nI recommend using propane heaters. Propane heaters are much more temperature-resistant than diesel heaters. Pressurized propane does not freeze anywhere near the humanly-endurable temperatures present on earth.\nConclusion Effectively combating diesel fuel gelling in cold weather is crucial for the reliable operation of your diesel heater. By implementing the strategies discussed - using anti-gel additives like Hot Shot\u0026rsquo;s Secret, adding kerosene to diesel, employing 12V silicone heating pads, and insulating exterior-facing parts of the fuel lines - you can significantly enhance your heater\u0026rsquo;s performance in low temperatures.\nEach method addresses a specific aspect of the gelling issue, from chemical prevention to physical protection.\nRemember, the key to avoiding diesel gelling lies in proactive and preventive maintenance. By staying ahead of the problem and adapting to the challenges of colder weather, you can enjoy uninterrupted warmth and comfort from your diesel heater, regardless of how low the mercury drops.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fix-diesel-heater-fuel-gelling/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen it’s getting cold, the diesel in diesel heaters tends to gel up, which, in turn prevents your diesel heater from working properly.

Faults can be anywhere in the fuel pump, the blower, the glow plug, or the electric supply.\nSo, when your diesel heater shows an E10 error code without any context, you usually have no idea where to start looking.\nThis article serves as a reference for the E10 error on diesel heaters. We’ll have a look at what the E10 code means, different reasons for the issue, and how to fix all of them.\nAfter reading this article, you will have a thorough understanding of what’s going on with your diesel heater, and - ultimately - you know what to do to fix it.\nWhat does the E10 Error Code on a Diesel Heater mean? The E10 error code represents a generic startup issue. E10 serves as a fallback error code if your heater can’t identify the exact cause.\nBecause your diesel heater doesn’t know what causes the startup issue, you have to inspect the heater yourself.\nBut the fact that your heater can’t identify the issue is already valuable knowledge for us. It means that the issue is in some unmonitored component of the heater, likely one of the following:\nElectric power upon heater startup Lack of fuel reaching the heater Combustion problems How to fix the E10 Error Code Let’s have a look at each of the causes in more detail and find out how to fix each of them.\n1. Electric Power Issue To start the combustion, your diesel heater needs sufficient electric power. If the power supply / car battery you’re powering your heater off supplies less too little electric current, the glow plug can’t ignite the diesel in the combustion chamber.\nUpon starting your diesel heater, for a short moment, it draws a large current from the battery, which causes a temporary voltage drop. If the voltage drops too low while powering the glow plug, it can result in an electronic circuit issue that prevents the onboard electronics from working properly.\nAfter multiple tries, your heater displays the E10 error.\nIn any case: A well-charged battery should be able to power the heater.\nHow to check it: Test the Power Supply: To test for an electric power issue, you can connect your car battery to a digital multimeter while trying to start your diesel heater. Before starting, the voltage should be \u0026gt;12V. Then, while starting, the voltage shortly drops and jumps up to 12V again.\nIf the voltage is consistently below 12V after starting the heater, your car battery is too weak to power it. Check Electric Connections inside the Heater: Also, ensure that all electric connections are fine. Disassemble your diesel heater and trace the electricity going into it. Make sure no connections are broken or corroded. How to fix it: Charge Car Battery: Ensure your car battery is properly charged. Use a New Battery: If it still doesn’t work, retry with a new car battery. Try DC Power Supply: If it still doesn’t work, try a different 12V power source, such as a variable DC power supply.\nSome diesel heaters come with a transformer that allows you to power the heater off a regular 110V wall outlet. Try that. If all of that looks fine, the issue is likely something other than the electric circuitry.\nHow to workaround the issue without fixing it Start your diesel heater while the engine is running. This obviously only works for diesel heaters in vehicles.\nWith a running engine, the power supply should be a solid 12 Volts. Once the heater runs, you can turn the engine off again.\n2. Fuel Problems If no fuel is reaching your diesel heater, it obviously can’t start, which causes the E10 error. Let’s have a look at the most common issues that cause a lack of fuel supply in your diesel heater.\nHow to Check It: Fuel Level: First, ensure there’s enough fuel in the tank. Pump Function: Listen to the fuel pump during start-up. A healthy pump should produce a consistent, rhythmic sound. Irregular or no sound can indicate a problem. Inspect Fuel Line: Look for any kinks, damage, or excessive length in the fuel line. A hard nylon line can resist kinks better than softer materials.\nBut a soft fuel line works just as well if it has no kinks and dents. Check the fuel pump!\nHow to Fix It: Refuel: If the tank is low on fuel, refill it. Pump Repair or Replacement: If the pump is faulty, it may need repair or replacement. Check the electrical connections to the pump as well. Pressure Adjustment: For pressure issues, adjustments can often be made on the pump (if it has adjustable settings) or by clearing any blockages in the line. Fuel Line Optimization: Lay out your fuel line in as straight a line as possible.\nShorten your fuel line if it’s too long.\nA long fuel line requires more pressure to work. The shorter your fuel line is, the better it works. Switching to a hard nylon line can prevent future kinks and bends, ensuring consistent fuel delivery. How to workaround the issue without fixing it In some cases, you can temporarily get your heater running by ensuring it’s on level ground (to aid fuel flow) or tapping or knocking against the fuel pump to kickstart it. However, these are only short-term solutions and won’t resolve underlying issues.\n3. Glow Plug and Burning Chamber Issues Diesel heaters oftentimes don’t monitor the combustion process, which results in the E10 error when something goes wrong.\nHow to Check It: Disassemble: Disassemble the heater to access the glow plug and burning chamber. Examine the Glow Plug: Look for signs of soot, carbon buildup, or physical damage on the glow plug. A clogged or dirty glow plug can’t ignite fuel. Check the Burning Chamber: Similarly, inspect the burning chamber for any dirt, soot, or obstructions that could impede its function. Atomizer Screen Assessment: The atomizer screen, which converts liquid diesel into a mist, is crucial for proper combustion. You can find it near the fuel inlet inside the combustion chamber of your diesel heater\nEnsure it’s clean and free from blockages. Air Intake Inspection: Verify that the air intakes are clear. Restricted airflow can lead to inefficient combustion and contribute to issues with the glow plug and burning chamber. A clogged exhaust can look like this if something went really wrong. It\u0026rsquo;s unlikely to happen, but make sure all airways in your diesel heater are free.\nHow to Fix It: Fixing these issues resolves mainly around cleaning the parts properly. To do that, either use a toothbrush or a fine wire brush, or compressed air.\nYou can use Brakleen brake cleaner for more thorough cleaning of the glow plug and atomizer screen, especially for removing stubborn carbon deposits.\nClean the Glow Plug: If you find dirt or soot on the glow plug, clean it thoroughly. In cases of severe damage or wear, consider replacing the glow plug. Burning Chamber Maintenance: Clean out any debris or soot from the burning chamber. Ensure it’s free from any obstructions that could affect the heater’s operation. Atomizer Screen Cleaning: Carefully clean the atomizer screen. A blocked screen can significantly impact the efficiency of fuel combustion. Clear Air Intakes: Make sure the air intakes are completely free. For this, a compressed air gun is ideal. How to Prevent the E10 error in the Future Here are some advanced, but very useful tips to keep your diesel heater working without issues in the future.\nFuel Line Insulation: Insulate your fuel line, especially in colder climates. This prevents the diesel from gelling, a lesser-known cause of fuel flow issues that can trigger the E10 error. Custom Fuel Mix: In extremely cold temperatures, mix a small percentage of kerosene with your diesel fuel. Kerosene can lower the gel point of diesel, improving flow and combustion efficiency, thereby reducing startup issues. Pre-Start Lubrication: Occasionally, use a diesel fuel additive that includes lubricants. I recommend Hot Shot’s Secret Diesel Winter Anti-Gel additive (click to see it on amazon). This can help maintain the smooth operation of internal components like the fuel pump and atomizer, which are crucial during startup. Battery Direct Connection: For heaters struggling with power issues, connect the heater directly to the battery using high-quality, thick-gauge wires. This bypasses any potential voltage drops from the vehicle’s wiring harness. Exhaust Backpressure Check: Occasionally check the exhaust system for proper backpressure. Incorrect backpressure can affect combustion, leading to errors. Adjusting or replacing the exhaust silencer can rectify this issue. Try diesel anti-gel additive. It will make a difference whenever it\u0026rsquo;s cold.\nWhat to do if you can’t fix the E10 error? If you can’t fix the E10 error code, and it keeps showing, maybe the E10 error code has a different meaning in your particular diesel heater model.\nI suggest looking up the manual. See if there’s a list of error codes and their associated meanings. If you don’t have the manual anymore, you can usually find it online, looking for your heater model number + manual.\nAlso, have a look at my diesel heater repair article: How to fix a diesel heater not getting hot\nAnd if that doesn’t help, just get a new diesel heater. The issue might be somewhere in the electronics or in another hard-to-repair part.\nI recommend getting this Vevor diesel heater (click to see it on amazon). Or, if you find it too strong (it’s 8KW), get the smaller 5KW variant. I find 8KW the better choice in most cases. Better to have too much heating power than too little. You can, of course, adjust the heat setting.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fix-diesel-heater-e10-error/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDiesel heaters are quite complex.

It can be the fuel pump, electronic controls, the car battery, the atomizer, the combustion chamber, anything.\nThis makes them relatively hard to troubleshoot. However, it’s not as hard as you think. When diesel heaters stop working, it’s usually just a bunch of common problems you need to check.\nIn this guide, we’ll have a look at these most common problems that cause your diesel heater to not blow hot air. And, of course, we’ll also check out how to fix each problem.\nSo, let’s start.\nHow to Fix a Diesel Heater Not Getting Hot 1. Fuel Pump Setting Too Low When the fuel pump is not pumping fuel quickly enough or with insufficient force, your diesel heater can’t heat properly.\nHow to check it: Ensure the fuel pump’s pumping frequency or pressure is not too low.\nHow to fix it: Increase the fuel pump setting to allow more fuel to reach your diesel heater. Note that this setting may not be available on all diesel heaters.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t adjust the fuel pump setting on your diesel heater, inspect the fuel pump manually and verify that it works correctly.\nEnsure the fuel pump is working and pumping properly.\n2. Low Battery A depleted battery, even if it’s just slightly below 12 Volts, can’t properly power a diesel heater. Oftentimes, it causes the glow plug to not get hot enough, or the fuel pump to not run with enough power.\nHow to check it: Use a multimeter to ensure the battery is fully charged. I’d suggest storing a digital multimeter in your car to check the battery status every now and then. This way, you’ll know exactly when to recharge your battery.\nHow to fix it: Recharge your battery. In the meantime, try operating the heater while your car, van, or truck engine is running to provide sufficient power. When the engine is running, you should get a solid 12 Volts. This obviously only works if your diesel heater is directly connected to the car battery and not an external battery.\n3. Bad Fuel Line Setup Diesel heater installation can be annoying. Especially if your vehicle was not laid out for an additional heater. So, oftentimes you end up with an improvised setup tailored to your car, van, or truck.\nBut in any case, you should make sure that the fuel line is cleanly set up. A too-long fuel line with dents and kinks can impede the flow of diesel to the heater and prevent it from heating.\nHow to check it: Check how the fuel line is set up. Look out for dents, kins, and unnecessary length.\nHow to fix it: Some diesel heaters come with multiple fuel lines - try using a different one. Ensure the pipe is as short as possible without dents or kinks, and that it doesn’t contain air bubbles. Surprisingly, thinner pipes can be more effective than larger ones, as they require less power to build pressure.\nTry different fuel lines. Usually, diesel heaters come with a set of them. Test which one works best for you.\n4. Clogged or Loose Atomizer Screen Since diesel does not combust easily, it needs to be atomized before ignition. That’s what the atomizer does.\nBut if the atomizer screen is clogged or improperly seated, it can significantly reduce the efficiency of your diesel heater, or cause it to stop working \u0026amp; not get hot at all.\nHow to check it: Disassemble the diesel heater and inspect the atomizer screen for soot, dirt, or clogging.\nHow to fix it: Regular cleaning is necessary for the atomizer screen to function properly.\nClean the screen (I recommend using Brakleen brake cleaner) or replace it if necessary, ensuring it is firmly seated.\nA loosely seated atomizer screen will allow some un-atomized diesel to reach the glow plug, which should never happen.\n5. Clogged Fuel Line This one is rather obvious, but happens more often than you might think.\nDiesel fuel lines can clog after long periods of inactivity, which prevents diesel from reaching the heater.\nHow to check it: Inspect the diesel fuel line, starting from the tank until it connects to the heater. Also, check the pump and, if necessary, disassemble your diesel heater for a complete inspection, tracing where the diesel goes.\nYou can test the fuel line by unmounting it and blowing through it.\nHow to fix it:: Unclog the fuel line, using compressed air, or, if necessary, with a long, thin nylon brush. There are fuel line cleaning sets specially made for this. Once the fuel line is free, re-prime the pump.\n6. High Altitude Mode The higher the altitude, the lower the oxygen content in the air. If you run a diesel heater at high altitudes, it can lead to improper combustion and increased soot buildup.\nSome diesel heaters have a high altitude mode setting to adapt oxygen intake. Since it changes combustion settings, this mode should only be activated at high altitudes, which it is designed for.\nHow to check it: Check the altitude of your current location. At high altitudes (\u0026gt;8,000 feet), heaters may burn improperly, leading to increased soot buildup, and lower efficiencies.\nHow to fix it: If you are at a high altitude, you need to activate high altitude mode. At low altitudes, disable it.\nFor instance, on Happy Buy 5kW Diesel heater models, press and hold the OK and settings buttons together to switch from regular to high altitude mode. For other models, consult the manual.\nSome other models, such as some Vevor diesel heaters, have an automatic altitude adaption mechanism, so you don’t have to manually switch modes.\nIf your diesel heater doesn’t have an altitude setting, you can still manually adjust the oxygen intake of your heater.\n7. Electrical Connection Issues Your diesel heater might not be working properly if the wiring is faulty. Luckily, this is straightforward to check.\nHow to check it: Inspect all electrical connections for corrosion or looseness. If all exterior connections are fine, disassemble your diesel heater and inspect the internal circuitry for faults. I like to set a timer to 5 minutes and just stare at the electronics. In most cases, you’re able to spot faults visually.\nYou can also wiggle the wires with your fingers to check that they are securely connected.\nHow to fix it: Clean any dirty or corroded connections with a contact cleaner and ensure they are securely fastened.\nIf you find any other electronic flaws (such as burn marks or blown parts), try to identify the model number (or at least the electric specification) of the affected part and replace it. This requires soldering skills.\n8. Malfunctioning Thermostat The thermostat controls the burn rate of the fuel to reach a set temperature. To do that, thermostats must constantly measure the temperature of your diesel heater.\nA malfunctioning thermostat can fail to regulate the heater’s temperature, leading to heating issues.\nHow to check it: Test the thermostat’s functionality with a multimeter. Locate the temperature sensor wired to the thermostat and check if it reads a voltage. Monitor the sensor voltage and confirm that it increases with increasing temperature.\nHow to fix it: If your thermostat’s temperature sensor is faulty, replace it. Also, check for blown parts or parts with burn marks on the circuitry and replace any faulty parts you locate.\n9. Air in the Fuel System Air bubbles in the fuel system can disrupt the steady flow of diesel, impacting the heater’s functionality.\nHow to check it: Open up your diesel heater and look for air bubbles in the transparent parts of the fuel line.\nHow to fix it: Bleed the fuel system to remove any air pockets. Then, prime the pump and try running your diesel heater again.\nIf bubbles build up again, likely there is an issue with the fuel line itself. Either it has tiny air cracks that allow air to enter the system, or it is improperly installed.\nInstall a new fuel line. Keep it as short as possible and avoid dents and kinks.\n10. Worn-out Glow Plug A worn-out glow plug can hinder the ignition process in your diesel heater, leading to starting issues or inefficient heating.\nHow to check it: Disassemble your diesel heater and remove the glow plug. Visually inspect it. Look for physical damage, such as cracks or swelling, and signs of overheating like blistering or excessive carbon buildup.\nYou can use a car battery to test a glow plug. Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the glow plug\u0026rsquo;s electrical connector and ground the body of the plug. Power the plug and check if the tip glows red-hot quickly (it should take no longer than 1-2 seconds).\nHow to fix it: Replace the glow plug if it shows signs of wear or fails the electrical test. Ensure the replacement is compatible with your heater\u0026rsquo;s specifications. After replacing it, test the heater to ensure it starts properly.\n11. Blocked Exhaust or Air Intake A clear path for exhaust and air intake is crucial for the optimal functioning of your diesel heater. Blockages in these areas can lead to inefficient operation or even prevent the heater from working.\nHow to check it: Carefully examine both the exhaust and air intake vents. Look for any obvious blockages, such as leaves, dirt, or debris, that might impede airflow.\nUse a flashlight to inspect deeper sections.\nHow to fix it: Remove any visible blockages by hand or with tools. For more stubborn debris, compressed air can be effective.\nBroken heaters, especially when they leak fuel, or have a similar fatal issue, clog up quickly. If your diesel heater is as clogged as the one in the image above, get a new one.\n12. Overheating Due to Poor Ventilation Since diesel heaters blow hot air, they have to first suck in cold air. The air entering, however, contains dust dust particles, which clog the heater over time. This can cause overheating.\nAlso, a too-narrow placement, for example under a car seat, worsens the diesel heater’s chances of overheating.\nHow to check it: Turn on your diesel heater. If it starts heating, but then shuts off on its own, it is likely an overheating issue.\nCheck if the heater is placed near materials or in a position that might restrict airflow, such as tightly enclosed spaces or near furniture and fabrics.\nHow to fix it: Disassemble your diesel heater and thoroughly clean its internals. Remove any dust that can block airflow and cause overheating.\nReposition the heater or clear out surrounding items to improve air circulation.\nTry running your diesel heater on lower heat settings and see if it works.\nWhat to do if you still can’t fix your Diesel Heater Get a new Diesel Heater If you’ve tried all these fixes and your diesel heater still isn’t functioning properly, it might be time to consider purchasing a new one.\nMy recommendation is this LF Bros diesel heater, which is compatible with 12V, 24V, and 110V power sources. So, you can even run it at home, or in a garage, off your wall outlet.\nWith 5kW it is more than hot enough to keep large spaces well-heated, but it’s not too large to fit in your car, van, or truck.\nA (Better) Alternative: Propane Heaters I’ve described all the differences between diesel heaters and propane heaters in a thorough post already. Here’s the gist of it:\nDiesel heaters have one fundamental drawback. Since diesel burns so poorly, diesel heaters need several helping mechanisms. They need atomizers, glow plugs, air intakes, exhausts, electric controls, built-in blowers, etc.\nBecause of that, all diesel heaters require electricity to run. And because diesel heaters are such complex devices, they are complex to troubleshoot (as you’ve seen in this article).\nDiesel heaters consist of dozens of components. All of which can break. Which makes them hard to troubleshoot.\nPropane heaters, on the other hand, are much easier to operate. They don’t require electricity. And they contain no moving parts that wear down over time. So, they practically last a lifetime.\nIf you can’t fix your diesel heater, my personal recommendation is to seriously consider getting a propane heater. They are headache-free heaters.\nMy starter recommendation is the Mr. Heater Big Buddy (click to view it on amazon). If you want to know more about it before buying, check out this propane heater guide.\nConclusion Usually, you can fix a diesel heater not getting hot by ensuring the fuel line is unclogged, the battery is charged, and the device is clean and free of dust.\nIf these 3 central fixes don’t work in your case, you need to inspect the electronics, the glow plug, and the fuel pump.\nIf you can’t fix your diesel heater not working / not getting hot / not blowing hot air, I highly recommend getting a new heater. They don’t cost too much. And, if you’re done with diesel heaters, try a propane heater next time. Propane heaters are much simpler and less error-prone than diesel heaters.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/diesel-heater-not-getting-hot/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe single major disadvantage of diesel heaters is, in my opinion, that they contain too many different parts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen your diesel heater is not getting hot / not blowing hot air, the issue can be practically anywhere.

It’s insane.\nAnd if you’re someone who has never used either of them, you’re probably wondering what’s even different.\nOf course, as their names suggest, diesel heaters use diesel, and propane heaters use propane. That’s obvious. But the technical implications following the fuel choice are significant.\nIn this article, we’re going to have a look at the differences between diesel and propane heaters and which of both, in my opinion, is the better heater.\nAlso, I’ll recommend you a good and trustworthy diesel heater and propane heater at the end of this article.\nQuick answer: Propane heaters don’t need any electricity, no installation, and output lots of heat. They are great for off-grid heating, camping, garages and workshops. Diesel heaters are best wherever you have electricity and a constant supply of diesel, as in vans / cars / trucks.\nBurn Rate: The Main Difference between Diesel and Propane as a Fuel If you hold a burning match directly to diesel, nothing is going to happen. At least not for a minute. Diesel, in that sense, behaves similarly to cooking oil.\nHold the match to diesel for a minute or longer, and its temperature slowly rises until it slowly catches a flame.\nIf you throw a burning match into a large tank of diesel, it will extinguish.\nIf you hold a match to a bowl of diesel, it won\u0026rsquo;t light!\nDiesel contains lots of energy but is very hard to light.\nIf you do the same and hold a burning match to a stream of propane gas exiting a tank, it instantly lights. And, if it were possible, you could throw the match into a pressurized tank containing liquid propane, it would explode instantly.\nDiesel burns slowly, while propane combusts instantly.\nIf you understand this single difference, you’re way ahead of most people and you can derive most of the advantages and disadvantages of diesel vs propane heaters yourself.\n5 Core Differences Between Diesel vs Propane Heaters Let’s have a look at how diesel and propane heaters differ:\n1. Electricity and Off-Grid Heating Propane Heaters Since propane burns so easily, propane heaters do not need electricity and work completely off-grid.\nAll it takes is a spark from a built-in igniter (similar to that of a lighter) to ignite a propane heater. In that sense, propane heaters work without electricity just like lighters work without electricity.\nAll propane heaters do is lead the gas coming from a propane tank to a ceramic heating element where the burning propane flame converts the combustion heat to infrared heat that radiates into the room.\nThere are some large-scale propane heaters, such as the Mr. Heater Big Maxx models, which do need some electricity. In an emergency, however, you can manually light them.\nBut all portable propane heaters, such as the Mr. Heater Buddy, work completely off-grid.\nIf you need an off-grid / emergency heater, get a propane heater.\nPropane heaters need only a propane tank to work, nothing else.\nDiesel Heaters Because diesel is so “hard” to combust, diesel heaters work completely differently than propane heaters do.\nFirst of all, the diesel in the diesel tank does not flow into the heater on its own. To move the diesel to the combustion chamber, diesel heaters need a fuel pump.\nThen, to ignite the diesel, you need some mechanism to disperse the diesel, which makes it easier to light. Then, you need a glow plug that lights it.\nAdditionally, diesel heaters need some electronic control mechanism to control the burn rate.\nAnd on top of that most diesel heaters additionally have a built-in fan to distribute the heat.\nDiesel heaters need electricity to run the fuel pump, glow plug, electronic controls, and the built-in fan.\nDiesel heaters don’t work without electricity and are, therefore, useless off-grid or in emergencies.\n2. Maintenance: Repairs and Cleaning As an engineer, I’ve learned one thing that always stuck with me: The more moving parts a device has, the more friction there is, which causes wear and tear, and breaks the device down.\nLet’s have a look at diesel and propane heaters in this context:\nPropane Heaters Propane heaters have no moving parts. Therefore, there’s no internal friction, and parts don’t wear down.\nTheoretically, propane heaters work indefinitely.\nPractically, however, propane heaters need some basic maintenance.\nRefined liquid propane in propane bottles is never 100% propane. There are always small amounts of side-products in propane fillings, usually oil.\nThe oil in a propane tank can end up inside your propane heater’s pilot light orifice and clog it over time and cause it to stop working.Luckily, that’s simple to fix. Just clean the pilot light opening with a Q-tip and rubbing alcohol and it works again.\nThe orifice where the small pilot light comes out needs a yearly cleaning. But that\u0026rsquo;s about it for propane heater maintenance.\nThe easiest way to work around this problem is to use a propane hose with a built-in fuel filter with your propane heater. Then, you need to do practically no maintenance.\nPropane heaters have no moving parts, and, therefore, don’t wear down over time. They might need an occasional pilot light cleaning if you use a propane hose without a filter.\nDiesel Heaters Diesel heaters, with all of their built-in moving parts, wear down over time. It’s unlikely a diesel heater outlives a propane heater. All the internal friction wears down a diesel heater over time and breaks down its parts.\nSo, an occasional part replacement, for example, of the glow plug, is not unusual.\nAnd, diesel heaters are prone to soot buildup, primarily in the combustion chamber, exhaust system, and air intake.\nSo, you will have to clean that regularly. Overall, I’d say, diesel heaters require more cleaning than propane heaters.\nAlso, Diesel heaters have fuel filters that need to be checked and replaced periodically. A clogged fuel filter can restrict fuel flow, leading to inefficient operation or heater failure. You have to replace the fuel filter according to the manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s recommendations, usually once a season or after a certain number of operation hours.\nDiesel heaters wear down faster and require more cleaning than propane heaters.\n3. Fuel Supply Propane Heaters There are two ways to get propane. Either you buy propane bottles and small tanks for one-time usage, or you get a large tank, have it refilled and pay by the gallon, which is usually cheaper.\nIn most places, there is a propane refill station / store within a few minutes\u0026rsquo; driving distance.\nYou can buy propane bottles and pre-filled tanks at any Home Depot. And websites like Propane-Tanks.com help find refill stations across the US and Canada.\nPropane is available anywhere within a short driving distance.\nDiesel Heaters Just like propane, diesel is widely available. You can get diesel at any gas station.\nThat makes diesel heaters incredibly convenient for car / van / truck heating.\nWith a diesel heater, you can get fuel refills at every gas station. You never need to visit an extra place to refuel diesel.\nDiesel heaters are ideal for use in vehicles, since you can refill them at any gas station.\n4. Heat Output Propane Heaters Propane heaters are very strong. Depending on their size, they output anything between 9,000 BTU/h and 50,000 BTU/h (for completely off-grid heaters), and beyond 80,000 BTU/h for larger heaters that require some electricity.\nMost regular propane heaters that are portable and need no electricity output between 20,000 BTU/h and 30,000 BTU/h. That’s more than enough power to heat even large apartments and practically any garage, tent, or vehicle.\nDiesel Heaters Diesel heaters (for whatever reason) are rated in Kilowatts and usually output either 5kW or 8kW.\nThat corresponds to a range of roughly 17,000 BTU/h to 27,000 BTU/h.\nSo, diesel heaters output roughly the same heat as regular propane heaters, they need electricity to work.\nBut it’s hard to find any models stronger than that. For most vehicles and portable usages, they are more than strong enough. However, if you want to heat larger spaces, such as warehouses or large garages, you should pick a strong propane heater instead.\nIt’s easy to find a strong propane heater with 80,000 BTU/h to 120,000 BTU/h, but very hard to find a diesel heater with that heat output. I’ve found some torpedo-heater-style diesel heaters that output 30kW (~100,000 BTU/h), but these are only available in Europe, for some reason.\n5. Installation Propane Heaters Propane heaters are ready to go as soon as you hook them up with a propane tank. Propane heaters require no installation.\nSome wall-mounted propane heaters need to be mounted to the wall. And some (large-scale) vented propane heaters need a vent through the wall (but that’s the exception).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a fully installed wall-mounted Dyna-Glo propane heater: It\u0026rsquo;s wall-mounted and it has a simple propane line setup (which you can see below the heater)\nBut, on average, propane heater installation and setup takes just a few minutes.\nPlace the heater and tank wherever you need them. Connect them with a propane hose. That’s it.\nDiesel Heaters Diesel heaters always require installation, especially when you install them in a van, car, or truck.\nFirst of all, you need to install an additional diesel tank or tap into the main tank (which requires drilling a hole). Then, you need to lay out the fuel line and properly mount the diesel heater under a seat.\nThen, you need to setup an electric connection, either directly to your vehicle’s onboard electronics or to a replacement car battery you carry with you.\nOverall diesel heaters require more installation, including a tank setup, mounting, and electric wiring.\nDiesel or Propane Heater: Which One Should You Pick? So, which one should you pick: A diesel or a propane heater?\nBased on everything we found out so far, it’s pretty simple to make a good choice.\nHere’s the answer:\nWhenever you want to heat a fixed space (living space, garage, basement), or an off-grid place (cabin, tent, camping van), a propane heater is the best choice.\nIf you want to heat a car, van, or truck and you don’t mind the installation, but you do mind the refills, get a diesel heater.\nRecommended Heaters: Propane and Diesel It’s relatively easy to find good propane heaters, and relatively hard to find good diesel heaters.\nI guess the reason for that is that propane heaters are so simple and are easy to manufacture well. However, diesel heaters contain many components, are harder to produce, and less fault-tolerant.\nThere are two propane heaters, I want to recommend:\nMr. Heater Big Buddy: The Mr. Heater Big Buddy is a strong portable propane heater, heats without electricity and is the perfect off-grid and emergency heater. I have a Mr. Heater Buddy myself and love it. Dyna-Glo Wall-Mounted Heater: This Dyna-Glo wall-mounted heater is a great propane heater for any fixed setting, e.g. for heating garages, basements, etc., since it doesn’t take up any floor space. And, of course, it doesn’t require any electricity. Here’s my recommendation for a diesel heater:\nLF Bros Diesel Heater: The LF Bros Diesel heater has a built-in 5L (1.3 gallon) fuel tank, works on 12V / 24V car batteries, and comes with a 110V transformer, so you can even use it on a standard wall outlet! This diesel heater requires practically no setup for indoor usage. But of course, it only works with electricity. Great when you need a heater that works in your truck and your workshop. Conclusion Overall, diesel and propane heaters are quite different. But the differences are easy to sum up.\nPropane heaters work without electricity and require very little setup (aside from the propane tank). Diesel heaters need electricity to run, and require some setup (especially in a car).\nBoth output roughly the same amount of heat. Diesel is more abundantly available at any fuel station along the road.\nAnd I’m sure by now you know which heater is the better choice in your case!\nHope you enjoyed this article and found it helpful.

(5 Differences)"},{"content":"Some space heaters are made specifically for families with children. However, most of these “child-safe space heaters” are actually regular space heaters that are designed to look child-safe.\nBut inherently, there’s nothing that makes them safer than space heaters for adults.\nI really dislike the marketing scheme here. Just designing a dangerous device to look safe doesn’t make it safe. Especially not for children.\nIn this article, we’ll have a look at space heaters that are very safe for children, regardless of whether they are designed to look like baby / child products, or not.\nQuick Recommendation: The best child-safe heaters are Dyson Hot+Cool heaters, and, for babies, the Vornadobaby Tempa, with its lockable power switch.\nRead on to find out why.\nWhat makes a Space Heater Child-Safe? Space heaters marketed to be child-safe usually look like products for children, but inherently, they are still the same, dangerous space heaters.\nLet’s completely eradicate the notion of child products having to look like child products in your head and focus on what matters instead.\nHere’s what makes a space heater child-safe for real:\nNo sharp corners / edges: Rounded edges protect your child from dangerous injury. Of course, kids can bump into space heaters with rounded corners and still hurt themselves. But there’s not going to be any cuts or scars. Hidden heating element: Children experiment. A hidden heating element ensures that they can’t start a fire by putting poking into the space heater with toys / sticks / and similar Hidden fan blades: Child-safe space heaters should not have exposed fan blades that can cut your child’s fingers off. Ideally, the built-in fan is completely inaccessible from outside. Tip-over / Overheat protection: As soon as the space heater is tilted or gets too hot, it shuts off. Thick power cord: Any space heater should come with a power cord that can handle the electric load. Cheap power cords cause burnt wall outlets and, potentially, fire. No off-gassing (formaldehyde and other dangerous gases): Cheap heaters emit unhealthy gases when they heat up. Heaters with quality materials don’t. Any space heater that fulfills these criteria is child-safe.\nBest Child-Safe Heaters 1. Dyson Hot+Cool Surprise! The number #1 child-safe space heater is a Dyson Hot+Cool Heater and Air Purifier. It is not a space heater that was originally designed for children. However, it fulfills all of the criteria we just checked and even surpasses them.\nDyson heaters are round, safe, and very advanced.\nLet’s have a look.\n**Child-safe criteria****Does the Dyson Hot+Cool fulfill them?**No sharp corners / edgesyesHidden heating elementyesHidden fan bladesyesTip-over / Overheat protectionyesThick power cordyesNo off-gassingyes\nDyson Hot+Cool heaters are luxury items. Compared to other space heaters, they are on the more expensive side.\nHowever, by coincidence, they are the perfect child-safe heaters. Even though Dyson did not design them with children in mind.\nDyson heaters have a round, modern design. So, they don’t have any sharp corners or edges. Just like the built-in heating element, the fan is embedded deep inside the heater’s base, completely inaccessible for children.\nSo, children can’t hurt themselves on a Dyson heater at all.\nOf course, it is made of quality materials, doesn’t off-gas and the power cord is of good quality.\nSo, by all of our child-safe metrics, a Dyson Hot+Cool is an ideal heater for children.\nAdditional Advantages of getting a Dyson Hot+Cool for your Child’s Room And, you get a few more additional advantages:\nIt’s not a children’s product: Any product you buy specifically for children, your child is effectively outgrowing it at some point. But with a Dyson Hot+Cool, when your child doesn’t need it anymore, you can just use it yourself! The money you spend on it is not “wasted” on your child. It’s a heater you can use for many years and perfectly suitable for adult’s bedrooms and living rooms. Fan mode: The Dyson Hot+Cool is not only a heater, it’s also a fan. So, aside from keeping you and your child warm in winter, it can keep you cold in summer. Air purification: The Dyson Hot+Cool has a built-in HEPA filter that removes over 99.97% of allergens / bacteria / and other particles from the air. It keeps the air in your children’s room / nursery safe and clean. 2. Vornadobaby Tempa My second recommendation is the Vornadobaby Tempa. And here it gets interesting!\nThe Vornadobaby Tempa is a really good space heater specifically designed for small children and toddlers.\nNot only does it look like a child’s heater, but it also has one very important additional feature that makes it invaluable:\nThe Vornadobaby Tempa has a lockable shutoff switch, so children can’t turn the heater on by themselves.\nThis makes the Vornadobaby Tempa extra child-safe.\nThe yellow lever-lock on the left hand side of the heater (with the lock icon) can lock the power button to stay turned off. In the image, the lock is open.\nAside from that, it of course provides all the safety features you need, including tip-over protection and an automatic shutoff to prevent overheating.\nThe Vornadobaby Tempa outputs 900 Watts of heat. That’s less than a regular space heater, which outputs 1,500 Watts. So, it’s not ideal for being the sole heat source of a child’s room.\nBut as a supply heater, it works great.\n**Child-safe criteria****Does the Vornadobaby Tempa fulfill them?**No sharp corners / edgesyesHidden heating elementyesHidden fan bladesyesTip-over / Overheat protectionyesThick power cordyesNo off-gassingyes\nAll in all it’s a great heater. However, once your child doesn’t need this heater anymore, you likely won’t find much use for it either.\nIt’s a small(ish) heater, so it won’t suffice for larger rooms such as living rooms.\nIt’s a great heater for babies and small children. But you won’t find much use for it outside of the child’s room / nursery.\n3. Dr Infrared HeatStyle The Dr Infrared HeatStyle is a very interesting infrared heater. And this one is actually the type of heater I referred to in the introduction.\nThe Dr Infrared HeatStyle combines powerful infrared heat with a child-safe cornerless design.\nIn principle, the Dr Infrared HeatStyle is very similar to any other Dr Infrared Heater. The only difference is that the corners are rounded and the whole thing is made of plastic instead of solid wood (which is not necessarily better). Now don’t get me wrong. Dr Infrared Heaters are, in my opinion, among the best infrared heaters you can get.\nHowever, they are not ideal as heaters for children.\nHere’s why:\nThe Dr Infrared HeatStyle is a full-blown 1,500 Watt infrared heater, just like an adult space heater. It just looks like a child’s heater, because of it’s rounded corners.\nThe main problem about that is that infrared heaters produce very high temperatures (\u0026gt;750°F) and, by design, the heating element of an infrared heater always has to be partially exposed (to let the radiant heat escape).\nEven though there is a protective grid, children can put their toys or sticks through the holes and touch the heating elements, which can end badly.\nSo, the Dr Infrared HeatStyle is, overall, a child-safe heater, but I would not recommend it for children under 6 years.\n**Child-safe criteria****Does the Dr Infrared HeatStyle fulfill them?**No sharp corners / edgesyesHidden heating elementpartially (heating elements are protected, but can still be accessed)Hidden fan bladesyes (works without a fan)Tip-over / Overheat protectionyesThick power cordyesNo off-gassingyes\nOne more advantage of the Dr Infrared HeatStyle is that you can wall-mount it. So, if you can mount it high up the wall, close to the ceiling, so that it is completely inaccessible to your child, it is practically 100% child-safe.\n4. DeLonghi Dragon Oil-filled Radiator My last recommendation for a child’s room / nursery is an oil-filled radiator. These are incredibly safe. My recommendation is the DeLonghi Dragon oil-filled radiator.\nOil-filled radiators are very safe by design. Their heating element is embedded deep inside the large oil-filled metal body. The oil then carries the heat from the heating element to the large metal surface, which practically turns the entire body of the heater into one large heating element. And because the heat is not focused in one point, but spread over a large surface area, oil-filled radiators do not get overly to the touch and you can’t burn yourself on them, while still delivering the same heat (1,500 Watts) as any other space heater.\nOil-filled heaters are, just like the Dyson Hot+Cool models, child-safe by accident. Even though they are not marketed as child’s products, they are child-safe.\nOil-filled radiators have a few more advantages when compared to regular space heaters:\nSpill-safe: There is no risk of electric shock when you spill something on them. All the “dangerous” parts are embedded in the oil-filled metal body. No moving parts: Oil-filled radiators don’t have buit-in fans and work completely without any moving parts. This makes them extra safe for children. Last a lifetime: Because oil-filled radiators don’t have any moving parts, and the oil is fully sealed inside the metal case, so it can’t escape, oil-filled radiators don’t wear down. They easily last decades if not a lifetime. Since the DeLonghi Dragon radiator was not designed for children, it does not have a child-safe power button, so your child will be able to turn it on. Also, of all the heaters in this list, it is the heaviest one, which might be a disadvantage if your child likes to tip stuff over.\nAnd, you can’t mount an oil-filled radiator to the wall. So, it always takes up some floor space.\nTechnically, oil-filled radiator are incredibly clever. But even though oil-filled radiators are the safest space heaters for adults, they are still large, bulky devices, which would make them unsafe for your child.\nI recommend oil-filled radiators for sane children and children over the age of 6.\n**Child-safe criteria****Does the DeLonghi Dragon fulfill them?**No sharp corners / edgesyesHidden heating elementyesHidden fan bladesyes (doesn’t even have a fan)Tip-over / Overheat protectionyesThick power cordyesNo off-gassingyes\nWhich Heater Should You Pick for Your Child? Choosing the right heater for your child’s room is a critical decision that hinges on safety, efficiency, and suitability to your child’s specific needs. Based on our comprehensive analysis of various child-safe heaters, here are some tailored recommendations to help you make the best choice:\nChild age and activity level: For very young children or toddlers, the Vornadobaby Tempa is an excellent choice. Its child-lock feature and the tailored design for young children make it a standout option.\nOn the other hand, for older children, especially those over six, the DeLonghi Dragon Oil-filled Radiator offers a safe, efficient heating solution without the worry of them interacting with the controls in a potentially harmful way. Long-Term Usage and Versatility: If you’re looking for a heater that transcends the label of a ‘child’s product’, the Dyson Hot+Cool is a savvy investment. It blends seamlessly into any room’s decor and can be repurposed for other areas of the home once it’s no longer needed in your child’s room. This makes it a financially sound choice in the long run. Accessibility to Children: The Dr Infrared HeatStyle, with its ability to be mounted high on a wall, is a suitable choice for larger spaces, keeping it out of reach of younger children. Conclusion In conclusion, your choice should balance safety, functionality, room size, and the specific needs of your child.\nEach of these heaters brings something unique to the table, and the best choice will depend on your individual circumstances and priorities.\nRemember, investing in a high-quality child-safe heater is investing in your child’s comfort and safety.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-child-safe-heaters/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome space heaters are made specifically for families with children.

All this, of course, earns me some money as well, when people buy from my recommendations.\nBut, I, myself, actually don’t use space heaters that much.\nI find myself using hot water bottles for a majority of my working time. And if I tell my readers about one thing while using the other, there might be some interesting knowledge to be gained.\nIn this article, we will break down the key differences between hot water bottles and electric space heaters.\nFor many people, space heaters will be a total waste of money, while hot water bottles will be true money savers.\nSo, let’s have a look.\nQuick Pick: Go for a 2L Hot Water Bottle For those considering a hot water bottle, I highly recommend a 2L size.\nMy recommendation is this 2L hot water bottle I found on amazon.\nIt’s the sweet spot for warmth - retaining heat longer than the smaller 1L bottles and reducing the frequency of boiling water.\nThe 2L size offers a perfect balance of lasting warmth and convenience. While brands may vary, the key is in the size and durability.\nSo, choose any well-made 2L bottle for a comfortable, cozy experience.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my 2L hot water bottle. Love it!\nSpace Heater vs Hot Water Bottle: What are the differences? 1. Total Expenses: A Cost Comparison Space Heater Costs - More Than Just the Price Tag Quick Summary: Running a space heater isn’t cheap. For 8 hours a day, it’ll cost you about $61.20 a month. That’s like adding a couple of fancy meals to your monthly expenses! Behind the Numbers: This figure comes from a typical 1,500-watt heater used daily. It’s the small daily costs that add up, reflecting in your electricity bill. Hot Water Bottle Costs - Pocket Change! Economical Choice: Using a hot water bottle every day? Your monthly cost is a mere $1.53. That’s less than a cup of coffee! Calculation Simplified: Boiling water four times a day with a standard kettle is incredibly cost-effective. It’s warmth at the price of pennies. The Bottom Line Stark Contrast: There’s a big difference between the two. A space heater, while convenient, can be a significant addition to your monthly expenses. The hot water bottle, on the other hand, is a symbol of efficiency and economy. 2. Health and Wellness: Comfort Beyond Warmth As a heating expert, I’ve learned that choosing between a space heater and a hot water bottle isn’t just about warmth—it’s about your overall well-being.\nSpace Heaters: Watch the Air Quality Dry Heat: Space heaters can dry out the air, potentially irritating your skin and respiratory system. Quick Tip: Pair your space heater with a humidifier or a bowl of water to keep the air comfortable. Hot Water Bottles: Gentle and Therapeutic Moist Heat: They offer a more skin-friendly warmth, without drying out the air, and can relieve muscle aches and stress. Perfect For: Those with sensitive skin or who need localized pain relief. Your Health, Your Choice Balance is Key: Consider your health needs when choosing. If you have respiratory issues or dry skin, a hot water bottle might suit you better. Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to how you feel with each heat source and adjust accordingly. In short, think about how each option affects not just your temperature, but also your comfort and health. Your ideal choice should make you feel warm and well.\n3. Feeling of Warmth / Heating Efficiency The distinction in the feeling of warmth and heating efficiency between a space heater and a hot water bottle lies in their modes of heat transfer and the directness of their warmth.\nHot Water Bottles: Direct Contact and Efficient Heat Transfer Direct Heat Transfer: Hot water bottles provide warmth through direct contact. This method ensures that the heat is transferred efficiently to the body with minimal loss. The heat from the hot water bottle is concentrated, targeting specific areas like feet, hands, or a cold lap. No Heat Loss through Air: Unlike space heaters, which heat the surrounding air, hot water bottles transfer heat directly through touch. This means there’s no heat loss by transmission through the air. In an environment where you’re seeking personal warmth rather than heating an entire room, this directness makes hot water bottles highly efficient. The sensation of holding or resting against a hot water bottle is one of immediate, enveloping warmth. This is particularly comforting in colder weather or when you need quick relief from the chill. The direct contact ensures that the heat is not dissipated into the surrounding environment but is instead concentrated where it’s most needed.\nSpace Heaters: Ambient Warmth with Transmission Losses Ambient Heating: Space heaters work by warming the air in a room. This form of heating is effective for creating a comfortable ambient temperature in a space but can be less efficient for personal warmth. Heat Loss through Air: The process of heating air and circulating it through a room inherently involves heat loss. Warm air tends to rise away from where it might be most needed, and in larger or poorly insulated rooms, a lot of the heat generated by a space heater can be lost. Space heaters are ideal when the goal is to raise the overall temperature of a room or when multiple people need to be warmed. However, for individual comfort, particularly when seated or stationary for long periods, the heat can feel less concentrated and slower to affect one’s personal sense of warmth.\nIn fact, I found the best way to improve an electric oil-filled radiator’s efficiency, by directly touching it with your feet (similar to a hot water bottle).\nEfficiency in Context In terms of heating efficiency, a hot water bottle, with its direct and concentrated heat transfer, is superior for personal warmth. It’s especially effective in scenarios where you’re stationary for extended periods, like working at a desk or relaxing on a couch. Space heaters, while excellent for warming an entire room, might not provide the same level of direct warmth and can be less efficient due to heat loss through air transmission.\nThe choice between the two comes down to the specific heating needs: for personal, targeted warmth, the hot water bottle excels, while for overall room heating, a space heater is more appropriate.\n4. Heating Speed Hot Water Bottle: Quick and Immediate Warmth Fast Preparation: One of the most significant advantages of a hot water bottle is the speed at which it can provide warmth. Boiling water and filling the bottle is a matter of minutes. From my experience, you can have a hot water bottle ready in about 5 minutes, offering almost instant comfort. Direct Heat: The moment you cuddle up with a hot water bottle, the warmth is noticeable. This immediacy is especially beneficial if you need quick relief from the cold. Space Heater: Gradual but Consistent Initial Warm-Up Time: Space heaters generally take longer to impact the temperature of a room. Depending on the size of the space and the heater’s capacity, it might take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour to feel a significant difference. Sustained Heating: Once a space heater reaches its operating temperature, it maintains a consistent level of warmth in the room. This is ideal for long-term comfort, especially in larger spaces. 6. Logistics / Weight / Preparation Time Hot Water Bottle: Simplicity and Ease Effortless Preparation: Filling a hot water bottle is a straightforward task. The process of boiling water, either in a kettle or on the stove, and then transferring it into the bottle, is simple and requires minimal effort. Lightweight and Handy: Hot water bottles are lightweight and easy to handle. They can be tucked into a bed or placed on a lap without any hassle. This ease of handling makes them very user-friendly, especially for elderly individuals or children. Space Heater: Bulky and Less Flexible Setup and Placement: Space heaters require a bit more thought in terms of placement. They need to be situated near an outlet and kept away from flammable materials. In my experience, finding the right spot for a space heater where it’s both effective and safe can sometimes be a challenge. Heaviness and Mobility: Many space heaters are bulky and heavy, making them difficult to move. Some models do come with wheels or handles, but they’re still not as portable as a hot water bottle. 7. Safety Hot Water Bottle: Low-Risk Comfort Minimal Safety Concerns: The hot water bottle is an exceptionally safe heat source. The only time it uses the electric grid is during the boiling of water. Once filled and sealed, there’s no further risk of electrical hazards. Worst-Case Scenario: The worst thing that can happen with a hot water bottle is a water spill, which, while potentially uncomfortable, poses no significant danger. I often recommend hot water bottles for their safety, especially in homes with children or pets. Space Heater: Requires Constant Vigilance Ongoing Safety Risks: Space heaters, by contrast, are a constant safety threat. They need to be operated with caution, particularly around flammable materials. I’ve seen incidents where curtains or furniture placed too close to a heater have led to dangerous situations. Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuous use of space heaters requires regular monitoring and maintenance. They should not be left unattended for long periods, and it’s crucial to ensure they’re functioning correctly to avoid fire hazards or electrical issues. 8. Emergency Heat Hot Water Bottle: Versatile in Emergencies Multiple Heating Methods: In emergency situations, like a power outage, a hot water bottle still proves to be useful. You can heat water on a gas stove or even over a fire. This versatility is a significant advantage, ensuring you can have warmth even when the grid is down. Reliable and Accessible: I always emphasize the importance of having a backup heating plan, and hot water bottles fit perfectly into this role. They’re a reliable source of heat in emergencies, requiring only a heat source to warm the water. Space Heater: Limited Emergency Use Dependence on Electricity: Most electric space heaters are useless during power outages. Their reliance on the electric grid makes them impractical as an emergency heat source. Propane Heaters as an Alternative: While electric heaters fall short in emergencies, propane heaters can provide ample heat. However, they require the presence and handling of propane, which might not be feasible or safe for everyone. 8. Sustainability Hot Water Bottle: Long-Lasting and Durable Durability: A hot water bottle, with proper care, can last for many years, even decades. Their simplicity contributes to their longevity, with no moving parts or complex mechanisms to break down. Eco-Friendly Option: From a sustainability perspective, hot water bottles are an excellent choice. They require minimal resources to produce and maintain, and their long lifespan means less waste. Space Heater: Varies by Type Dependent on Design: The sustainability of space heaters varies widely depending on their design. Oil-filled radiators, for example, tend to have a longer lifespan. However, heaters with moving parts, like fans or blowers, are prone to more frequent breakdowns due to dust accumulation and mechanical wear. Considerations for Purchase: When choosing a space heater, I always advise considering the type and its expected lifespan. Opting for models with fewer moving parts can enhance sustainability and reduce the need for replacements. 9. Noise Hot Water Bottle: Silent Comfort No Noise Emission: One of the most significant advantages of a hot water bottle is its silence. It emits no noise, making it ideal for use in quiet environments or during sleep. The absence of any sound adds to the comfort and relaxation it provides. Space Heater: Sound Levels Vary Varied Noise Output: Space heaters, depending on their type and model, can emit varying levels of noise. Some models, especially older ones or those with fans, produce a noticeable hum or buzzing sound. Consideration for Quiet Environments: In settings where noise is a concern, such as bedrooms or quiet workspaces, the noise level of a space heater can be a significant drawback. It’s something I always ask clients to consider, especially if they’re sensitive to sound or require a tranquil environment. Conclusion: Should you Use a Space Heater or a Hot Water Bottle? After years of working with heating systems and seeing a wide range of needs and preferences, I’ve come to realize that the choice between a space heater and a hot water bottle isn’t just about the device itself, but about understanding your specific circumstances and requirements. Here’s my advice on making the right choice:\nOpt for a Space Heater If: Unreliable Home Heating System: If your home’s central heating system is not reliable or efficient enough to keep your entire home warm, a space heater can be a valuable addition. It ensures that your living space remains comfortable, even when the main system falls short. Family with Kids: Families with children often need a consistently warm environment. Children, especially the younger ones, are more sensitive to cold. A space heater can provide the necessary ambient warmth to keep the entire family comfortable. Need for Overall Warmth: If your goal is to raise the temperature of an entire room or house, rather than just warming yourself, a space heater is the way to go. It’s designed to distribute warmth throughout a space, making it ideal for general heating needs. Health Concerns: In situations where frequent cold can lead to health issues, such as for elderly family members or those with certain medical conditions, maintaining a warm environment is crucial. A space heater can provide the consistent, controllable heat needed to safeguard health. Choose a Hot Water Bottle If: Base Heat Covered: If your home is generally warm, but you find yourself needing a bit of extra heat, a hot water bottle is an excellent choice. It’s perfect for adding that extra layer of warmth without overheating the entire room. Personal Warmth at a Desk: For those of us who spend long hours working at a desk, especially in home offices that might not be as well-heated as the rest of the house, a hot water bottle is a boon. It offers localized warmth, keeping you comfortable and focused. Energy Efficiency and Cost Savings: If you’re conscious about energy usage and looking to save on heating costs, a hot water bottle is a more economical and environmentally friendly option. Its direct heat transfer means you’re warming up exactly where and when you need it, without the higher energy costs of running a space heater. In my personal and professional journey, I’ve seen how the right choice of heating can not only bring physical comfort but also peace of mind. Whether it’s the cozy, targeted warmth of a hot water bottle or the room-filling, ambient heat of a space heater, understanding your needs will guide you to the best choice for your comfort and well-being. Remember, it’s not just about the heat — it’s about how that heat serves your life.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/space-heater-or-hot-water-bottle-9-differences/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve been writing articles for this website for over 4 years now, spending hours and hours explaining space heaters and how to use them effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the while resting both feet against a hot water bottle lying on the floor, under my desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one thought just popped up in my mind: Am I a hypocrite?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve spent so much time \u0026amp; effort writing about heaters and telling people which products to buy.

(9 Differences)"},{"content":"I’ve spent countless nights in my car. This article is all about the best car camping heaters, found in years of trial and error.\nOne thing I learned is: You can make any night comfortable \u0026amp; warm with the right preparation, even without much special gear.\nOr … to be honest … almost any night. Some nights are just doomed to be freezing cold.\nAnd for those freezing cold nights, all you think about is “why didn’t I bring a heater?”.\nAt least that was my thought when I spent a night out in the mountains at 15°F (-9°C) in my car without any heat source.\nI woke up with a nasty cold the next morning, having shivered through a long night. And that was just the start of a long day of trying to climb a snowy peak. We eventually gave up half an hour of ice climbing away from the peak due to our energy levels fading.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a blurry picture from the coldest morning of my life, car camping mid-winter in the mountains.\nThe day would have looked completely different had I slept in a car even a tiny bit warm.\nThis article is all about proper car heating in freezing, harsh winters, and snow storms.\nHere’s how to stay warm in your car during winter:\nBest Car Camping Heaters for Winter First of all, you need an active source of heat. An active source of heat is something that produces heat in your car.\nActive heat sources are heaters of all sorts.\nWithout an active heat source, eventually, you’re going to cool down and freeze.\nLater, we’ll also check out passive heat sources, which are things that insulate, such as clothes and sleeping bags.\nLet’s have a look at the best heaters for winter car camping:\n1. Stansport Portable Propane Heater Cheap, adjustable, small, simple \u0026amp; lightweight. The Stansport Portable Propane Heater is the perfect car camping heater in many regards.\nActually, I wanted to place the Mr. Heater Little Buddy (from the next section) on rank #1 first. But then I discovered this Stansport propane heater. And it’s much better. By a large margin.\nFor a comfortable night of sleep in winter, you need to be able to set just the right heat output so you can sleep through the night without waking up.\nToo cold, and you’ll wake up freezing. Too hot, and you wake up to turn the heat down.\nFor winter car camping it’s critical to have a heater with which you can fine adjust heat settings and pick one of several low heat settings (ideal for small to medium-sized cars).\nAnd that’s critical! Most propane heaters are too strong for most cars. So, you can only run them on the lowest settings, which might still be too hot. And if that doesn’t suit you, you have to turn the heater off entirely.\nThe Stansport portable propane heater outputs a 3,100 BTU/h at most. Which is more than enough to heat a car. And you can choose between low (1,000 BTU/h), medium (2,000 BTU/h) and high (3,100 BTU/h) heat settings.\nOther propane heaters start at 4,000 BTU and you can’t adjust the heat to be any lower than that.\nSo, the Stansport heater is ideally sized for winter car camping.\nAdditionally, the Stansport heater is small \u0026amp; lightweight (1.8 pounds) and easily stores away in any car.\nAnd it is very affordable! Currently, It’s selling for $41.\nIt’s a very simplistic heater. But it’s just right for cars. And that’s why I put it on #1.\nThe only downside I can think of is that this heater is not great for heating large spaces. So, it’s not very versatile. But if you intend to use it only in your car and in small rooms, it’s perfect.\n2. Mr. Heater Little Buddy The Mr. Heater Little Buddy is a small portable propane heater. With a heat output of 3,800 BTU/h, it outputs a similar amount of heat as an electric space heater on a medium heat setting.\nIn freezing winter, the Mr. Heater Little Buddy won’t be able to turn your car into a sauna. But it will definitely keep you comfortable!\nThe Mr. Heater Little Buddy is a good winter car camping heater because it\ntakes up very little space: it is the smallest portable propane heater I know (but still larger than it appears in the pictures) consumes very little gas: on a grill-sized propane tank, it lasts for weeks outputs more than enough heat to keep your car warm when it’s freezing outside According to one buyer, the Mr. Heater Little Buddy makes “all the difference between having an enjoyable trip and freezing your toes off”.\nI put it as the #2 car camping heat because it’s got just the right size and just the right heat output for most cars.\nHowever, there are some downsides:\nThe Mr. Heater Little Buddy has no temperature control. In small cars, it can be too hot and you have to fully turn it off. And when the temperature drops, you have to manually turn it on again.\nThe Mr. Heater Little Buddy is, in this regard, very simplistic. For deep winter and snowstorm conditions, it takes off the cold and adds comfort to your car.\nI’d get the Mr. Heater Little Buddy for winter nights in a moderately sized car, with some free space to place it.\n3. Mr. Heater Buddy The Mr. Heater Buddy is a larger portable propane heater that provides heat of up to 9,000 BTU/h. So, it is more than twice as strong as the other recommended heaters.\nIts strength makes it perfect for large cars / camper vans and even RVs. On the lowest setting, the Mr. Heater Buddy outputs 4,000 BTU/h. So, you can run it on a similar heat setting as the Mr. Heater Little Buddy.\nThe Mr. Heater is the most versatile heater in this list. You can use it outside of car camping as well and even use it as an emergency heater in family homes / garages and workshops.\nBecause of its high heat output capability, the Mr. Heater is ideal for extreme cold, as you encounter in the northern states of the US / Alaska and Canada.\nAnd the Mr. Heater Buddy works in high altitude as well.\nYou should get the Mr. Heater Buddy if:\nyou’re car camping in extreme cold your car has enough space to place the Mr. Heater Buddy (it must stand upright, otherwise its tip-over protection triggers and stops the heating) you plan on using your heater outside of the car as well (in tents, at home, etc.) 3. Camping Kettle + Hot Water Bottle The by far most efficient form of heat transmission is always direct touch. When you touch a radiator, it feels a lot hotter than when you hover your hand 1 inch above it.\nYou can make use of this principle in your car using hot water bottles.\nHot water bottles are perfect when combined with good sleeping bags. In a well-insulated winter sleeping bag, a hot water bottle stays warm the entire night, since the heat can’t escape.\nI remember when I was trekking the Himalayas, the mountain huts we were sleeping in sold hot water bottles to put in your sleeping bag. One hot water bottle was $5, which is very expensive for Nepal, but in the freezing Himalayan cold, and the high altitude, it is worth its weight in gold. Especially when there’s no other source of heat.\nHot water bottles are much cheaper than running a fuel-based heater (such as a propane heater) for the entire night.\nYou’re only expending energy to boil a kettle of water (which is about 5 minutes of heating) and that’s it. After heating it, the heat energy will keep you warm the entire night.\nA gas heater, on the other hand, requires constant running to keep you warm.\nProbably the main downside of using a hot water bottle is that your car stays cold. Unlike a heater, a hot water bottle heats only the immediate space around it (your sleeping bag), and not the entire car.\nSo, in extreme cold, you can’t unfreeze your car with it.\nBut using a hot water bottle is incredibly energy-efficient. If you want to save money, get a hot water bottle and try it.\n4. Diesel Heater Lastly, I want to also mention diesel heaters. Diesel heaters run on diesel and usually don’t have their own tank. So, you either have to get a separate tank to supply your diesel heater, or you have to somehow drill a hole in your tank and connect your diesel heater to it.\nSome camper vans have a separate diesel tank for diesel heaters. But cars usually don’t have that.\nOverall, diesel heaters require quite a bit of technical setup. Additionally, you need to connect them to your car’s electric circuit.\nDiesel heaters inconveniently require electricity to run their built-in electric thermostat controls, blowers, and electric autoignition.\nSo, diesel heaters are very bad emergency heaters. As soon as the electricity goes off, they won’t heat!\nDiesel heaters output a large amount of heat (similar to a propane heater). But I don’t really like them because of all their technical complexions, while still not being able to run on their own, without electricity.\nYou can’t really depend on a diesel heater.\nOne more advantage is that you can refuel your diesel heater whenever you refuel your car.\nOverall, I’d get a diesel heater, if you want to install a permanent heat source in your car, you enjoy the installation process, and you don’t need to rely on the diesel heater, because you always stay close to civilization.\nDiesel heaters are a good choice for people living in their cars and sleeping in parking lots, for example.\nBut they are not a good choice for anyone exploring the wilderness during winter. In that case, rather get a propane heater with a large backup propane supply.\nMore Essential Gear for Winter Car Camping Aside from a heater, you should also bring a sleeping bag. I can recommend this Bessport Sleeping Bag.\nI have used it on multiple cold nights in cars, as well as for wild camping in the Swiss Alps. It really works in cold weather.\nThis sleeping bag is not a winter sleeping bag, but a 4-season sleeping bag, so you can use it anytime. Although, in summer it’s too hot for me, so I use it as a blanket.\nIn regular cold winters, you can use this sleeping bag without a heater. The coldest temperature I used this sleeping bag (without a car which provides insulation from cold weather) was 15°F (-9°C), sleeping on just a sleeping pad, without a tent. So, it definitely works. But that night was very uncomfortable and I was waking up shivering, although I wore a hat and multiple layers of clothing.\nWith a heater, the Bessport sleeping bag is always comfortable \u0026amp; warm. I’d say as long as you can keep the temperature in your car above 35°F, you’re fine with the Bessport sleeping bag.\nFor below 15°F (outside) get a dedicated winter sleeping bag.\nBonus Tip: Bring Someone An extra person in your car will help keep the car warm, even without a heater. With someone else you can keep the temperature in your car above 50°F (10°C), even if the outside temperature drops below 35°F.\nElectric Car Heaters: Should You Use Them? In this article, I haven’t covered any electric car heaters. I can’t recommend them. Here’s why:\nA regular 12V outlet in a car can only provide 120 Watts to 240 Watts.\nThat corresponds to a heat output of roughly 800 BTU/h at most. While that’s better than nothing, it is by far not enough to keep your car warm in freezing winter.\nThere are some stronger 600 Watts to 800 Watts electric car heaters you have to hard wire into your car’s circuitry to bypass the 12V outlet.\nAll of those car heaters, however, will drain your car battery.\nA 200W device would take approximately 3.6 hours to drain a typical car battery with a capacity of 60 ampere-hours and a voltage of 12 volts.\nSo, your car battery won’t last for a full night with an electric heater. And in the morning, the car won’t start anymore.\nElectric car heaters are dangerous and potentially life-threatening when they drain your car battery.\nConclusion: What\u0026rsquo;s the Best Car Heater for Winter? The best car camping heaters for winter are propane heaters. These output enough heat to keep your car warm, last a full night, and don’t drain your car battery.\nDiesel heaters are a good pick for anyone who wants to live in their car long-term and needs a fixed installation below a seat.\nElectric car heaters are a bad idea! They drain your car battery within a few hours after which you can’t start your car anymore.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-car-camping-heaters-for-winter/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve spent countless nights in my car.

First off, I want to say, I am absolutely no van expert since I don’t possess one myself.\nBut I spent several nights in really cold environments, sleeping in an unheated car, sleeping outside on a freezing parking lot in mid-winter in the alps, and I even spent nights off-grid above 15,000 feet in the Himalayas.\nSo, even though I don’t drive a van around myself, I experienced quite a few nights in the freezing cold. And since I’ve been writing about heaters on this website for over 4 years now, it’s time to devote an article to the van community.\nRealistically, I should write about spending nights in unheated cars in alpine environments. But who’s ever going to read that? So, with this article my goal is to help you pick the best winter heating strategy for your van, so you don’t end up like me.\nHow to Prepare your Van for Winter Heating Before you start heating, you should prepare your van. Here’s how:\n(Optional) Basic Van Insulation Ideally, before you start heating, you should add insulation to your van. Insulation helps retain the heat in the cold winter.\nSince vans are mostly metal, they are highly conductive to heat, which means they effectively carry all the inside heat outside.\nInsulation can be as simple as mounting cloth to the sides of your van. Any non-metallic material added to the inside walls of your van adds insulation.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s me \u0026ldquo;insulating\u0026rdquo; my car for a freezing night. Basically, I wrapped everything in blankets. It worked out. We didn\u0026rsquo;t even need a heater.\nBut ideally, you should cover your van in fiberglass insulation. Fiberglass insulation is very similar to wool, but it’s fireproof. It traps air between the millions of fiber strands, which prevents heat from escaping your van.\nFiberglass insulation is very affordable if you don’t buy it on amazon. For whatever reason insulation (and other home-DIY-project materials) seem to be rather expensive there.\nInstead, get it in a local hardware store, and purchase multiple rolls at once. Look for a product similar to this fiberglass insulation roll.\nOn a budget, you can just mount any insulating material to the walls of your van. Styrofoam is good. Even wood is a good insulator. Just add something non-metallic.\nIn which case you don’t need insulation in your van I put insulation as optional in this guide, since it’s not for everyone. For example, if you spend less than 3-5 nights a year camping in freezing cold winter, insulation is not necessary.\nThat doesn’t mean you should freeze those nights!\nBut instead of spending hundreds of dollars on insulation material, you might as well spend a couple dozen dollars more on a larger propane supply (or whatever heat source you use) and just heat more.\nWe’ll have a look at a few great heaters later on.\nFor a few nights a year, heating without insulation is the better choice money- and time-wise.\nOf course, you should still pack warm blankets, sleeping bags and warm clothes.\nFire-Safety Equipment Always pack a fire extinguisher. You can hide one beneath your bed, or below one of the seats. Or just hang it on the wall.\nA fire extinguisher saves lives. Never skip it.\nPick a Heater for Your Van Here comes the exciting part. After all the preparation talk, let’s find out the best ways to heat a van.\n1. Propane Heater The best way to heat a van is a wall-mounted propane heater, such as a Bluegrass Living propane heater.\nPropane heaters output a lot of heat and require no electricity!\nWall-mounted heaters don’t take up any floor space, which is perfect for vans. And that’s, by the way, the reason I don’t often recommend other portable propane heaters for heating tiny spaces. Popular portable heaters, such as the Mr. Heater Buddy series, just take up too much space.\nYou might have to reinforce the wall-mount and customize it a bit to make it bulletproof (depending on your driving style and the driving terrain, you don’t want your heater to fall off the mount). But once it’s installed, you’re ready to reliably heat.\nPropane heaters need only propane to heat. They can usually(but not always) run without electricity. So be careful when picking another model. The one I recommended works without electricity.\nPropane heaters are perfect for vans, because they output a lot of heat, much more than any electric heater. They output so much heat, you don’t necessarily need insulation if you don’t spend too many nights out during winter.\nAnd, I personally love the technology in propane heaters. It’s ingenious. They use no moving parts (no built-in blowers) to work, so they don’t wear down over time! A propane heater is a one-off investment that can last you decades.\nIdeally, you should get a battery-powered carbon monoxide detector with your propane heater. I’ve seen several experiments with propane heaters in closed-shut vans. And they never produced any carbon monoxide, simply because vans are never fully sealed and always leak air. But just to make sure, get a carbon monoxide detector. It’s probably also better insurance-wise.\nAnd, I almost forgot it: Propane heaters are completely silent, which is perfect for sleeping.\nSo, in summary, get a propane heater, because:\npropane heaters produce lots of heat propane heaters work without electricity propane heaters don’t wear down and last decades propane heaters are silent 2. Diesel Heater A second way to heat a van in winter are diesel heaters. One example is this 8kW Vevor diesel heater.\nDiesel heaters consist of many parts (as you can see here)\nThe biggest advantage of diesel heaters is, in my opinion, that you can get refills at any gas station along the road. So, when refueling your van, you refuel your diesel heater as well. No extra stop required.\nSimilar to propane heaters, diesel heaters output much more heat than electric heaters.\nBut, diesel heaters have several drawbacks when compared to propane heaters:\nFirst of all, diesel heaters need electricity to run the fuel pump, the igniter, the blower, and the electric thermostat.\nIn an outage (e.g. your van breaks down and the battery dies), you can’t rely on a diesel heater.\nA diesel heater is not an ideal off-grid heater.\nAlso, compared to propane heaters they are very complicated to install. Diesel heaters require a fuel line, vents, and electric supply connections. All of which you must lay out in your van if they are not already present.\nThe hardest thing about installing a propane heater, on the other side, is just finding a place to mount it (and its propane tank). But they require neither air vents nor electricity.\nAnd because of the rather complicated assembly, and the plethora of electronic moving parts (pump \u0026amp; blower), diesel heaters wear down with time and don’t last as long as propane heaters. There are just too many parts that can break.\nSo, if you’re getting a heater, I highly recommend getting a propane heater over a diesel heater, except you have a very specific reason to get a diesel heater.\n3. Heat Pump A third van heating option for the winter is a heat pump. One example is this Coleman rooftop heat pump.\nHeat pumps can be a good choice if you want one device to heat during winter and cool during summer.\nHowever, they run on 115V electricity alone, so you will also need an inverter and large energy sources, such as batteries or a generator.\nHeat pumps are reasonable if you spend a lot of time in your van. However, compared with propane and diesel heaters, they are very expensive.\nAnd on top of that, they don’t even provide as much heat as propane heaters or diesel heaters.\nFor example, the heat pump I linked outputs ~5,000 BTU of heat per hour. The propane heater linked earlier costs just a fraction, is much simpler to install and operate, and outputs up to 20,000 BTU per hour.\nNow you can guess what the better heater is in the freezing cold winter.\nSince heat pumps rely on heavy-duty electricity, it will stop working as soon as your van and its backup energy sources go down.\nI don’t like that. When I’m out in the wild, I want independent heat that still works, even when I crash my car.\nI’d pick a heat pump in a large \u0026amp; fully equipped RV that I ride for vacation in comfortable environments where little can go wrong.\nBut in a van, in freezing winter, I’d always prefer a propane heater.\nMore Ideas for Keeping Warm in your Van during Winter Window Insulation: In addition to wall insulation, consider insulating your van\u0026rsquo;s windows. Windows are a major source of heat loss. You can use insulated window covers, which can be custom-made or bought, to keep the heat in during the night. Ventilation: While keeping the van insulated and warm, it\u0026rsquo;s also important to ensure proper ventilation to avoid condensation and maintain air quality, especially when using propane heaters. A small, controlled airflow can help prevent moisture build-up and maintain a healthy environment inside the van. Layered Bedding: Invest in quality, layered bedding. Using a combination of thermal blankets, sleeping bags rated for low temperatures, and even a down comforter can significantly increase your comfort on cold nights. Thermal Curtains: Consider installing thermal curtains or dividers inside the van. These can help to create smaller spaces within the van that are easier to heat and maintain warmth. Rug or Carpet: Adding a rug or carpet on the floor of the van can provide additional insulation and make the space feel warmer underfoot. Pre-heat Your Van: If your van has a standard heating system (from the engine), use it to pre-heat the interior before switching to your main heating source for the night. This can give you a head start on warmth. Hot Water Bottles: Use hot water bottles as a low-tech, low-cost heating solution. Filled with hot water and placed in your bed before you get in, they can provide warmth for hours. Regular Maintenance: Whichever heating system you choose, ensure regular maintenance to keep it running efficiently and safely. Emergency Kit: Always have an emergency kit that includes extra blankets, warm clothing, a first-aid kit, and some form of communication device in case of breakdowns or unexpected weather changes. Solar Power: If you have or can install solar panels, they can be used to power electric heaters or other devices, making your van heating more sustainable and reducing reliance on external power sources. Before The Trip: Inspect Your Van’s Winter Readiness Now you have all the tools you need to spend a heated night out in your van, even in freezing winter.\nBefore you head off, go through this winter van checklist to ensure everything works out as planned:\nHeating System Check: If you have an installed heating system, test it before your trip to ensure it\u0026rsquo;s functioning correctly. Check fuel levels, electrical connections, and ventilation systems. Battery Health: Cold weather can be harsh on batteries. Check your van\u0026rsquo;s battery and any auxiliary batteries for charge capacity and signs of wear. Consider a battery heater if you’ll be in extremely cold environments. Insulation Inspection: Examine your van’s insulation, especially if you have custom insulation installed. Look for gaps or areas where heat might escape and seal them. Don’t forget to check window seals and door edges. Tire Condition: Winter tires or all-weather tires are essential for safe travel in icy or snowy conditions. Check the tread depth and consider carrying chains if you anticipate heavy snow. Antifreeze Levels: Ensure your van\u0026rsquo;s antifreeze is at the correct level and concentration to prevent freezing in the cooling system. Emergency Supplies: Stock your van with winter-specific emergency supplies, including blankets, extra warm clothing, a shovel, ice scraper, sand or kitty litter for traction, and a well-stocked first aid kit. Fluids Check: Check all fluid levels – oil, brake fluid, windshield washer fluid (winter grade), and power steering fluid. Cold weather can affect fluid viscosity and performance. Lights and Visibility: Ensure all lights are working properly for visibility in shorter daylight hours. Clean your headlights, taillights, and indicators. Windshield Wipers: Replace old wipers with winter-grade wipers that can handle snow and ice buildup. Water System: If your van has a water system, ensure the pipes are insulated to prevent freezing. Consider using antifreeze specifically designed for RV water systems. Ventilation: Good ventilation is crucial to prevent condensation and maintain air quality. Check that vents are clear and functional. Roof and Exterior Check: Inspect the roof for leaks or damage that could be exacerbated by snow or ice. Clear any debris from gutters or drainage paths. Mechanical Components: Have a mechanic inspect your van’s mechanical components, such as brakes and suspension, to ensure they are in good condition for winter conditions. Carbon Monoxide Detector: If you’re using a combustion heater (propane or diesel), ensure you have a working carbon monoxide detector for safety. Conclusion In most cases, a propane heater is the best way to heat a van during winter.\nPropane heaters are very safe and, because they are so simple, they are very durable and last you decades.\nAlso, propane heaters output a lot more heat than other heaters, but without all the complexity.\nAll you need is a propane tank and the heater and you’re ready to heat.\nI recommend a wall-mounted propane heater, because they take up less space in a van. But if space is not an issue, you can use a portable propane heater as well.\nMake sure to get a few extra blankets for winter and, ideally, some backup form of heat for emergencies such as a water kettle to make hot water bottles.\nInspect your van before heading off into the freezing winter and enjoy the ride!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-heat-a-van-in-winter/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHi all.

In the context of a device like the Dyson Pure Humidify+Cool, the drip tray serves a specific function related to the machine’s operation:\nFunctionality: In the Dyson Humidify+Cool, the drip tray collects water dripping from the evaporator. Location: The drip tray is usually located beneath the evaporator or the area where condensation is most likely to occur. It’s strategically placed to catch any drips or condensation efficiently. Importance: The drip tray is essential for the proper and safe functioning of the humidifier. It helps in managing water inside the device, ensuring that the humidity is released into the air without causing internal water accumulation, which could lead to issues like mold growth or electrical problems. Overflow Issues: If the drip tray becomes full or clogged, it can lead to an overflow, where the collected water exceeds the capacity of the tray and potentially spills over. This triggers the “Drip Tray Overflow” error in your Dyson Pure Humidify+Cool, indicating that attention is needed to resolve the issue. How does a Dyson Humidify+Cool Catch the Error? Dyson Humidify+Cool fans contain an “evaporator tray sensor” that constantly measures the water level of the drip tray.\nIf water reaches the sensor, it raises the drip tray overflow error.\nHow Severe is the Error? Usually, drip tray overflows can be fixed by emptying / drying the drip tray. The error, when caught and fixed early, does not harm your Dyson humidifier.\nIt is not a severe error, but it requires immediate action.\nHow to Fix the Drip Tray Overflow Error Fixing the drip tray overflow error is usually simple and requires no tools. Here’s what to do:\n1. Perform a Deep Clean Cycle First, perform a Deep Clean Cycle. During a deep clean cycle, your Dyson humidifier carries out self-maintenance that helps resolve the drip tray overflow error.\nYou can find deep clean cycle instructions on the tank lid.\nNormally, your Humidify+Cool fan prompts you to perform deep clean cycles in regular intervals. But you don’t have to wait.\nTo manually initiate a deep clean cycle, quickly press the deep clean cycle button three times in a row.\nThen, follow the usual deep clean cycle procedure.\nAfter the deep clean cycle completes (which usually takes 1 hour), run your Dyson Humidify+Cool and activate the humidification.\nPossibly the error is resolved now. If not, continue with the next fix.\n2. Dry Drip Tray \u0026amp; Sensor If the error persists, check the drip tray. First of all, remove the filter shrouds using the release button. This should release the outer covers and automatically open the inner door.\nPlease note to open the filter area of your Humidify+Cool, using the filter release button, not the water tank release button!\nThen, remove the evaporator to be able to access the drip tray. The drip tray is the tray that was hidden below the evaporator.\nNow, with a dry sponge or paper towels, thoroughly dry the drip tray. Also, clean any excess water around the drip tray.\nMake sure there is no remaining water anywhere around the tray. Also, if you can see the evaporator tray sensor head, make sure that is dry as well.\nNow, reassemble your Dyson Pure Humidify+Cool. Turn in on and activate humidification.\nIt should work now.\nIf it doesn’t, continue with the next section.\n3. Hard Reset the Humidifier If the drip tray overflow error persists, even though the drip tray is completely dry (as described in the previous section), there might be an issue with the tray sensor.\nIn a Dyson Humidify+Cool, there are many sensors, several for air quality measurements alone.\nWhen sensors in a Dyson don’t work correctly, oftentimes, a recalibration resolves the issue.\nTo force a recalibration of the sensors in a Dyson Pure Humidify+Cool, hold the power button on the unit and on the remote simultaneously for 10 seconds.\nA countdown animation appears on the LCD screen. Wait for it to countdown and release the power buttons when the animation finishes.\nNow, your Dyson humidifier is reset. Switch the info screen to display air quality and temperature measurements. The information is not available for a while, because your humidifier recalibrates itself.\nOnce the temperature and air quality readings are available, the calibration is successful.\nTurn on humidification and see if it works.\nIf that didn’t resolve the drip tray overflow issue, continue with the next section.\nWhat to Do if You Can’t Fix the Drip Tray Overflow Error? If neither the deep clean cycle nor thorough drying and recalibration resolve the drip tray overflow error, the error is likely a software issue or permanent damage to a circuit board.\nIn this case, just get a new Dyson humidifier. I recommend the Dyson Pure Humidify+Cool PH04(click to see it on amazon).\nIf you’re still within the warranty period (2 years after purchase), contact Dyson’s customer support. They will aid you through similar fixing steps and none of them will work. Then, they’ll conclude it’s best to replace your device and send you a new one.\nIf you’re outside of warranty, buying a new humidifier is the only option.\nYou can still sell your broken Dyson Humidify+Cool for a couple of hundred dollars online. Just make sure to declare it as broken and mention the drip tray overflow error.\nThen, use the money from your sale and buy a new humidifier.\nMaintenance: How to Prevent the Drip Tray Overflow Error in the Future Once the drip tray overflow error is resolved, or once you have a new unit, you can take the following actionable steps to avoid the drip tray overflow error in the future:\nDon’t overuse humidification: The evaporator inside your Dyson Humidify+Cool fan can’t evaporate water when humidity levels are high. The water condenses and accumulates in the drip tray, leading to the error.\nUse humidification only when necessary, for example, when you live in dry climate. Don’t use humidification when it’s cold: Humidification doesn’t work when it’s cold. Cold air causes the water to condense and accumulate in the drip tray. When it’s cold, turn on a heater first before you turn on your humidifier. Wait for your room to heat up and only then use the humidifier. Don’t skip deep clean cycles: When deep cleaning is due, take the time and clean your Dyson humidifier. You shouldn’t skip deep clean cycles. Otherwise, minerals build up which stop your humidifier from working properly. Conclusion Usually, the drip tray overflow error can be fixed by drying the drip tray (sitting below the evaporator), performing a manual deep clean cycle, and forcing a hard reset.\nIf these fixes don’t work, likely, the drip tray sensor or the electronic circuitry is faulty.\nIn this case, either get a new Dyson humidifier or contact Dyson support to resolve the issue with you.\nThey won’t be able to help much, but if you’re still within warranty, you can get a replacement unit.\nTo prevent drip tray overflow errors in the future, use the humidification mode only when necessary. Don’t use your Dyson Humidity+Cool when it’s cold. And regularly perform the deep clean cycles when prompted.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fix-dyson-drip-tray-overflow-error/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSymptom:\u003c/strong\u003e Dyson Humidify+Cool shows a “Drip Tray Overflow” error after activating humidification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"/are-dyson-humidify-cool-fans-worth-it/\"\u003eDyson Pure Humidify+Cool\u003c/a\u003e is a combined humidifier, air purifier, and fan.

The recent PH04 is around $900. Older models such as the PH03 still sell for $700 - $800.\nBut what’s so special about a Dyson humidifier? Can it do more than just add humidity to your room? And is getting one worth it?\nIn this article, we’re going to have a critical look at Dyson Humidify+Cool models, checking out how well they really perform and if they do justify their price tag.\nAre Dyson Humidify+Cool fans worth it, or are they just empty marketing claims?\nQuick answer:\nThe Dyson Humidify+Cool series combines air purification, humidification, and cooling in a sleek design, but at up to $900, it may not offer enough value for everyone. While technologically advanced, similar benefits can often be achieved with separate, more affordable devices.\nWhat Sets the Dyson Humidify+Cool Apart? Dyson is a well-known name in the world of home comfort appliances, promising top-tier performance and sleek design. But beyond their polished looks, what really makes the Dyson Humidify+Cool models stand out? Let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at their features and technology.\nIn particular, we’re looking at the Dyson Humidify+Cool PH04 model(click to see it on amazon) and similar (PH03, PH3A).\nInnovative Features The Dyson Humidify+Cool machines do more than just add moisture to the air. They serve three functions: they purify, humidify, and cool your space. One key feature is the HEPA filter, which is designed to capture tiny particles like allergens and pollutants.\nPlus, they have a UV-C light to clean the water, ensuring that the moisture they release is free from bacteria.\nThese devices also provide updates on your indoor air quality through the Dyson Link app, which allows you to track and adjust your air treatment as needed.\nDesign and Aesthetics Dyson\u0026rsquo;s designs are modern and attention-grabbing. Their bladeless fans are safe to use around children and pets, and they\u0026rsquo;re simple to clean - no awkward grilles or blades. The devices are built with ease in mind; they have straightforward controls, a simple remote, and a display that’s easy to understand.\nTechnology Overview The technology behind the Humidify+Cool series is centered on what Dyson calls Air Multiplier™ technology.\nIt’s a fancy term for a simple concept: Air multiplier technology is all about narrowing the escape area of the airstream to speed up airflow (but reduce airflow diameter).\nThis feature draws air into the machine and pushes it out smoothly, creating a steady and powerful flow of purified, humidified air across the room.\nMoreover, the built-in climate control means the machine can monitor the room\u0026rsquo;s temperature and humidity, adjusting itself to ensure the environment stays comfortable without adding too much moisture.\nWhat I personally enjoy most is the detailed air quality monitoring, achieved by a set of sensors for various particle sizes and specific chemicals (formaldehyde). Even high-end air purifiers don’t offer as detailed air quality reports as a Dyson.\nIn conclusion, Dyson\u0026rsquo;s Humidify+Cool models combine functionality with design and user-friendly technology. These aspects might make the higher price point more palatable for those who prioritize advanced features and ease of use.\nThe Dyson Humidify+Cool PH04 specifies the gasses it captures. The 4 air quality sensor holes showcase Dyson\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on proper air quality monitoring.\nWhat Does Owning a Dyson Humidify+Cool Cost? When you\u0026rsquo;re shelling out up to $900 for a humidifier and fan combo, it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand what you\u0026rsquo;re actually paying for. Let\u0026rsquo;s dissect the cost and see if the features of the Dyson Humidify+Cool can justify the hefty price tag.\nPrice Analysis Buying a Dyson Humidify+Cool is an investment in a piece of technology that does more than just blow air. It\u0026rsquo;s equipped with the following features:\nadvanced air purification, using a HEPA filter to trap tiny particles a UV-C light to sterilize the water, similar to specialized air purifiers and water sanitization systems smart home integration app controls to control your device from your phone or get real-time air quality updates regular fan mode If you look at each feature individually, a Dyson Humidify+Cool would only be worth it if each feature was worth \u0026gt;$100-$200 to you.\nI’d say that’s hardly the case.\nYou can get a self-standing air purifier for $100 that cleans the air just as well. You can get a water sterilizer for $50. You can get a regular fan (much stronger than the Dyson) for $50.\nThe value of a Dyson Humidify+Cool stems from the seamless combination of air purification, humidification, ventilation, and smart app controls. You can save money by buying fans, air purifiers, and humidifiers separately, which clutter your room. But with a Dyson Humidify+Cool, it’s all in one unit.\nWhether that’s worth close to a thousand dollars to you is a personal question. To many people it is.\nIt is important to reflect whether you need all of the features, or whether you want just a purifier or humidifier. In this case, buying individual devices is, financially speaking, the sane choice.\nWe’ll have a look at competitors and their price tags later.\nPerformance Evaluation Functionality In everyday use, Dyson Humidify+Cool models are designed to adapt to your room\u0026rsquo;s climate.\nThis adaptability means you\u0026rsquo;re not constantly fiddling with settings - the machine\u0026rsquo;s sensors do the work, adjusting the airflow to maintain the right balance of humidity and temperature.\nBut how does it perform with the core function - humidifying plus cooling? Users report that it\u0026rsquo;s exceptional at creating a comfortable environment, especially in areas with dry or polluted air.\nAnd the cool breeze is a bonus, making it useful year-round, not just in dry winter months.\nEfficiency The energy consumption of these models is competitive with other high-end appliances.\nA Dyson Humidify+Cool consumes 30 - 60 Watts, depending on the humidity of the air and the fan setting.\nFans and humidifiers are generally low-power devices. So, it’s not a special accomplishment from Dyson that their Humidify+Cool devices are energy-efficient.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re designed to run efficiently, with features like an auto-shutoff and night mode, which help conserve energy when full power isn\u0026rsquo;t needed. This means that, over time, the cost of running a Dyson Humidify+Cool can be even lower than expected.\nRunning a Dyson Humidify+Cool costs 11 cents per day.\n( I used an average power consumption of 30 Watts and an electricity rate of 17 cents for the calculation )\nAir Quality \u0026amp; Pollution: Does a Dyson Humidify+Cool Clean The Air? Air Quality The Dyson Humidify+Cool’s ability to improve air quality lies not just in its HEPA filtration, which traps fine particles, but also in its humidification process that can help decrease the presence of airborne pathogens.\nDry air allows pathogens to travel more easily, and by maintaining optimal humidity, the Dyson unit can indirectly reduce this risk.\nThe cooling function doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly purify the air, but it does distribute the cleaned and humidified air more evenly throughout the room, increasing overall comfort and ensuring that purified air reaches more areas.\nWith its HEPA filter, a Dyson Humidity+Cool cleans the air just as well as any other air purifier. Since the filter follows the HEPA standard, the air purification is neither better nor worse than other air purifiers.\nThe HEPA filter in a Dyson Humidify+Cool looks high-tech. And it is. But it is not any better than any other HEPA filter in a regular air purifier.\nHealth Impact Using a Dyson Humidify+Cool could bring potential health benefits, especially for those with allergies or respiratory issues.\nThe cleaner air produced by the HEPA filter means fewer allergens to trigger symptoms.\nMoreover, the UV-C light ensures the humidity added to the air is germ-free, which is crucial for those with compromised immune systems or asthma.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to note that while these devices can improve indoor air quality, they are not a cure-all for health issues and should be used as part of a broader approach to health and well-being.\nLongevity and Durability: Does a Dyson Humidify+Cool fan last? When you\u0026rsquo;re investing in a high-end appliance like the Dyson Humidify+Cool, longevity and durability are key considerations. Dyson is known for its commitment to quality and design, but how does this translate into the lifespan of their products?\nBuild Quality Dyson products generally have an acceptable build quality and feel luxurious.\nStill, they are mostly plastic and don’t make use of durable, high-quality materials such as metal or wood.\nFor close to $900, you can expect more than that.\nYou’re paying a luxury price, but you don’t get luxury material.\nTechnical Issues in Dyson Humidify+Cool fans Dyson Humidify fans are the most fragile type of Dyson fan. They have several known issues, that can be very annoying to deal with.\nThere are some issues, such as the deep clean cycle not working (for self-cleaning of limestone in the water tank) and annoying error codes ( F3 error).\nThese problems oftentimes require time-intense repairs, or don’t go away at all.\nTo resolve them, you need to rely on Dyson customer support, which seems to be ignorant of these issues.\nIdeally, they send you a replacement humidifier. But overall, it’s a lot of hassle to get technical issues in a Dyson fan resolved.\nSo, if you’re someone who wants a no-maintenance product, then a Dyson fan is not for you.\nThe high price does not protect you from having to troubleshoot technical problems.\nThe deep clean cycle oftentimes gets stuck after a few seconds on Dyson Humidify+Cool fans. Very annoying and hard to fix.\nIs It Worth the Investment? When considering whether the Dyson Humidify+Cool is worth its high price tag, it’s essential to examine the cost versus benefit and understand the scenarios where this product shines.\nTotal Cost of a Dyson Humidify Fan Initial Purchase Price: $700 - $900 Energy Consumption: Approx. $15.56/year (based on 5 hours/day usage at highest setting) Maintenance Costs: Filter replacements and occasional repairs ($40 - $80 a year depending on filter replacement frequency) All Benefits of a Dyson Humidify Fan Multifunctionality: Combines air purification, cooling, and humidification Space Efficiency: Ideal for compact spaces Air Quality Improvement: HEPA filter and UV-C light benefit those with allergies Smart Features: App connectivity for convenience Design: Modern aesthetic appeal Longevity: Potentially high long-term value with durable build Quick Comparison AspectDetailsInitial CostHigh ($700 - $900)Annual EnergyLow (Approx. $15.56/year)MaintenanceModerate (Filter replacement, potential repairs)FunctionalityHigh (Air purifier, fan, humidifier)Space EfficiencyHigh (One device instead of three)Air QualityBeneficial (HEPA filter, UV-C light)Smart FeaturesConvenient (App control, smart home integration)DesignAttractive (Modern aesthetic)LongevityHigh (Durable, long-term value)\nThe Dyson Humidify+Cool is a high-cost but high-value investment, especially for those prioritizing multifunctionality, improved air quality, and modern design.\nIts long-term value and efficiency make it a compelling choice for users willing to invest in a premium, space-efficient, and technologically advanced appliance.\nHowever, for those with less need for its combined features, separate devices might be a more cost-effective solution.\nScenarios of Use The Dyson Humidify+Cool is particularly suited for:\nSmall Space Dwellers: Those with limited space who can benefit from a single appliance performing multiple functions.

Propane-Powered: Requires regular propane refills, which is a consideration for ongoing maintenance and operation. Pros: Strong heating capability can quickly raise the temperature, even in large basements. Completely indoor safe \u0026amp; certified. The unit’s design ensures that it doesn’t encroach on your living or storage space. Low running costs make it economical over the long term. Independence from electrical power makes it reliable in all situations, enhancing its suitability for emergency preparedness. Cons: Requires propane tank refills. One product of propane combustion is water vapor. To avoid moisture buildup, you have to ensure proper ventilation. Best Suited For: This heater is particularly well-suited for individuals who use their basements occasionally and need a quick, powerful heating source. It’s also ideal for those seeking a backup heating system in case of electricity outages during winter storms.\nIt’s also suitable for large basements which require more heating power.\nEnergy Considerations: Propane is known for its cost-effectiveness as a heat source. The heater’s low running costs can be a significant long-term saving, cutting your heating bill in half (as compared to traditional electric heating).\nAlthough, the need for propane tank refills does add an extra task to your to-do list.\n3. Comfort Zone CZ220 (17,000 BTU / 5,000 Watts) The Comfort Zone CZ220 (click to see it on amazon) is a heavy-duty electric heater that delivers a massive 5,000 watts of heating power. Its ceiling-mounted design ensures that it takes up no valuable floor space, making it an excellent option for those who use their basement for storage or as a functional living space.\nOriginally, the Comfort Zone CZ220 is a garage \u0026amp; workshop heater, so it\u0026rsquo;s a very sturdy and industrial-looking heater.\nThe Comfort Zone is the strongest electric basement heater in this list. But it requires installation by a professional.\nKey Features: 5,000 Watts: This heater provides exceptional heating power, capable of warming large spaces quickly. That’s equivalent to approx. 17,000 BTU/h. Ceiling-Mounted: By being mounted on the ceiling, it saves floor space and distributes heat more evenly throughout the room. Hardwired Installation: Designed for a permanent installation into a dedicated circuit in your basement. Ideally, hire a professional to take care of the installation. Resistive Heating: This is a resistive heater, not a heat pump, meaning it converts electricity directly into heat without the efficiency of a heat pump. Pros: The heater’s 5,000 watts of power make it over three times as powerful as a regular 1,500-watt electric heater. The ceiling-mounted design is ideal for keeping your floors clear and the heat distribution even. You have the option to run it on lower settings to save on energy costs if full power isn’t necessary. Cons: The energy costs are high due to the nature of resistive heating - costing about $0.85 per hour at full power based on an electricity rate of 17 cents per kWh ( US average). It requires a professional installation, as it needs to be hardwired into your electrical system, which could add to the upfront cost. Not suitable for areas where electricity is expensive, as it could become cost-prohibitive to run during colder months. Best Suited For: This heater is best for locations where electricity is relatively inexpensive (ideally, lower than average) and for homeowners who are seeking a permanent heating solution in their basements.\nIts high heat output makes it suitable for large basements that require a significant amount of heating.\nEnergy Considerations: With the cost of operating at full power being approximately $0.85 per hour, this heater is not intended to be run 24/7. Ideally, you use it in short bursts whenever you need more warmth in your basement.\nOf course, you can adapt the heat setting and run it on lower power levels to save money.\n4. Heat Storm Infrared Heater (5,120 BTU / 1,500 Watts) The Heat Storm HS-1500-PHX (click to view it on amazon) operates at 1,500 watts, the standard for regular electric heaters, and uses infrared technology to provide warmth.\nInfrared heaters immediately heat objects directly in front of them, which in turn, emit convectional heat, which heats up the whole room. So, an infrared heater turns you into a heat source. And they make you feel very warm.\nThe Heat Storm infrared heater is the simplest of all basement heaters. Just plug it into the wall outlet, and start heating.\nKey Features: 1,500 Watts: Delivers a gentle heat, suitable for personal use or heating a small area, such as an individual room. Wall-Mountable: Can be mounted on the wall to keep the floor space clear, perfect for smaller or crowded rooms. Dust-Safe: Comes with filters that capture dust, helping to keep the air clean and reduce the buildup of dust inside the heater; filters are also washable for easy maintenance. Infrared Heating: Offers efficient, direct warmth without the need to heat the entire room, making it more energy-efficient in certain scenarios. Pros: Saves floor space due to its wall-mountable design, providing heat without clutter. The filters prevent dust buildup inside the heater (which is a frequent problem in electric heaters) and they are washable. Cons: With a 1,500-watt output, it’s not designed for large areas or as a primary heat source for spacey cold basements. It’s It is more suitable for spot heating or temporary use rather than consistent, long-term heating. Best Suited For: The Heat Storm Infrared Heater is ideal for those in need of temporary heating solutions—such as when hosting guests in the basement - or for targeted warmth in a designated area.\nThe Heat Storm infrared heater is very quick to set up and requires no installation (except the wall-mount, which is straightforward).\nEnergy Considerations: As a 1,500-watt heater, it consumes a lot less energy than other heaters in this list. And because it emits heat as focused infrared rays, the heat feels a lot warmer than it actually is.\nConclusion: What are the Best Basement Heaters? The best basement heater is the Pioneer Diamante Ultra Mini-Split Heat Pump (12,000 BTU) for those who use their basements regularly and seek an energy-efficient, long-term solution for both heating and cooling.\nFor a more cost-effective, powerful option without the need for electricity, the Dyna-Glo Wall-mounted Propane Heater (30,000 BTU) is ideal, especially in areas prone to power outages or for those who require strong heating capability.\nWhen choosing a basement heater, consider:\nMini-split heat pumps: Ideal for regular use, offering both heating and dehumidifying, with higher upfront costs but lower operating expenses. Gas heaters: Suitable for large spaces and power outage scenarios, require fuel refills but provide strong, consistent heat. Heavy.duty electric heaters: Save floor space and heat evenly, good for areas with lower electricity costs due to higher power usage.

Pick a heater that suits your space, usage frequency, and budget while keeping energy costs in mind.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-basement-heaters/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHeading into the colder months, we all know the struggle of keeping a basement warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasements, notorious for being the coldest rooms in the house, demand efficient and effective heating solutions to transform them into comfortable living or working spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether you require a permanent, powerful solution or a portable, occasional boost of warmth; whether you need a permanent, energy-efficient heater, or a heater with low upfront cost and high heat output, we\u0026rsquo;ve dissected the features, pros, and cons of the 4 best gas and electric basement heaters.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"4 Best Basement Heaters (Gas \u0026 Electric)"},{"content":"A freezing cold wood workshop is uncomfortable to work in. But what’s the best heater for wood workshops?\nWood workshops are quite special places not all heaters are suited for. Frequently, the air is dusty (from sawing and sanding), there’s a lot of flammable wood around, and oftentimes, wood workshops are not insulated too well.\nSo, an ideal wood workshop heater can handle dust exposure, is fire-safe, and outputs enough heat to keep your workshop at whatever temperature you desire.\nIn this article, we’re going to find you the right wood workshop heater.\nGas or Electric Heater: What to Pick for Your Wood Workshop? For most wood workshops, an electric or a gas-based heater is going to be the best choice. Which one depends on a few factors:\nGas Heaters (Usually) Output More Heat Does it need to be cozy warm (as in family living room-warm), or just warm enough for working? Gas-based heaters can output much more power than electric heaters since they are not limited by your workshop’s electric circuit.\nElectric heaters output less heat, but still enough to add some warmth and take away the chills during the freezing winter.\nThere are exceptions. Heavy-duty electric heaters output a lot of heat.\nI’ll list one electric heater that generates as much heat as a gas-based heater in this list (rank #3). But this one needs a dedicated install into your workshop\u0026rsquo;s electric circuit. You can’t just plug it in a wall outlet.\nGas Heaters Add Humidity, Electric Heaters Remove Humidity Gas heaters will add humidity to your wood workshop, while electric heaters generally remove humidity. This can affect the wood you’re working with. But for most hobby workshops, it doesn’t matter.\nMost Gas Heaters don’t Require Electricity Can your electric grid handle an electric heater? Fuses may trip when you run an electric heater and other power tools such as electric drills or saws simultaneously.\nIn this case, a gas heater is the better choice, since it runs completely independently of the electric grid.\nConsidering these aspects, let’s have a look at my ranked list of the best wood workshop heaters:\nBest Wood Workshop Heaters 1. Dyna-Glo Wall-mounted Heater (Propane Gas, 30,000 BTU) The best wood workshop heater is a wall-mounted propane heater. My recommendation is this 30,000 BTU/h Dyna-Glo propane heater (click to view it on amazon).\nWith 30,000 BTU/h it outputs almost as much heat as a wood stove, while still being simple to install.\nAll you need is a propane tank (bigger is better - I recommend 100lb) and you’re set for months of cost-effective heating.\nThe Dyna-Glo propane heater of course has a knob to adjust the heat output, so you can generate whatever temperature you desire. It’s strong enough to make your wood workshop cozy warm (as in: you can work during freezing winter just wearing a shirt), but you can of course run it at lower, more economic settings.\nThe best wood workshop heater is a wall-mounted Dyna-Glo propane heater. It outputs lots of heat, takes up no floor space, and is dust-safe.\nThis Dyna-Glo model series comes with different BTU (heat output) ratings. I recommend the 30,000 BTU variant for moderate to large wood workshops, since it’s really strong.\nFor smaller workshops, get the 20,000 BTU/h model, or even the 10,000 BTU/h one.\nBut in general, you can’t go wrong just picking the 30,000 BTU model. I consider any heater I buy also a backup heater for my family in case of an energy outage. And in an emergency, it’s better to have a stronger heater than a weaker one.\nSince propane heaters add some humidity to the space you’re heating, you’ll need to vent every couple of hours (or, say, once a day).\nThe Dyna-Glo propane heater is completely dust-safe, since dust settling on it burns off quickly, and does not have a built-in blower that clogs up over time.\nSince it doesn’t need any electricity to run, it does not interfere with other heavy-duty machines you use in your wood workshop.\nIt’s a perfect heater for the practicing craftsman.\n2. Dr. Infrared DR-998 (Electric, 5,120 BTU) Ranked second in this list is the Dr. Infrared DR-998 (click to view it on amazon).\nThe Dr. Infrared DR-998 is an electric infrared heater, protected by a solid wooden case that lasts and can take hits.\nIt’s the best electric heater for wood workshops. The Dr. Infrared requires no installation.\nContrasting many other electric heaters, with the Dr. Infrared DR-998 you can choose the humidity of your room. It’s got a built-in humidifier, which is perfect for wood workshops. Depending on what you’re doing, dry or humid air can be an advantage.\nIf you don’t care about humidifiers, just pick the regular Dr. Infrared heater (without humidifier).\nThe Dr. Infrared heater requires is the easiest-to-setup heater in this list. Just plug it in a wall outlet, and you\u0026rsquo;re set.\nContrasting the Dyna-Glo propane heater (my #1 recommendation for wood workshops), the Dr. Infrared outputs significantly less heat. That’s normal, since all standard wall outlet electric heaters (in the US) are limited to 1,500 Watts. That’s an equivalent of 5,120 BTU. The Dyna-Glo heater was 30,000 BTU.\n( I’ll recommend a heavy-duty electric heater that can reach propane heater-level heat outputs in the next section! )\nBut even 5,120 BTU is still enough for most small wood workshops, up to the size of a 2-car garage. Surely, it gets you an adequate, comfortable working temperature.\nInfrared heaters produce a focused beam of heat rays, which makes you feel very warm. Infrared heaters heat instantly. There’s no need to wait for your workshop to heat up. You feel heat coming off the heater within a few seconds after turning it on.\nThe biggest advantage of an electric infrared heater over a propane heater is that you never have to refill gas / fuel.\nHowever, in an energy outage, you won’t be able to use an electric heater as a backup device.\nThe Dr. Infrared heater has a built-in blower which sucks in air, heats it up, and blows it back into the room. Any heater that blows hot air eventually accumulates dust. For that, the Dr. Infrared has a built-in filter that you have to wash every few months.\nSome electric heaters don’t have filters, so the dust will clog the internal electronics, leading to hardware failures due to overheating. Luckily, this can’t happen with a Dr. Infrared heater!\n3. Comfort Zone CZ220 (Electric, 17,000 BTU) The best heavy-duty electric heater for wood workshops is the Comfort Zone CZ220 (click to view it on amazon).\nIt’s a 5,000 Watts heater that you have to hard-wire into your workshop’s electric circuit. The heat output is 17,000 BTU/h, which is similar to that of a strong propane heater.\nWith the Comfort Zone CZ220, you get the heating power of a propane heater combined with the low maintenance of an electric heater.\nIts main drawback is, in my opinion, the installation. You need to hard wire it into a 240V single-phase circuit. The installation should be done by a professional electrician.\nAside from that, it’s a great heater.\nThe heavy-duty electric heater Comfort Zone CZ220\nYou can mount it to the ceiling, so it takes up virtually no space.\nThe Comfort Zone CZ220 is perfect for larger wood workshops (the size of 2-4 car garages), even if they are not well-insulated.\nIt is the strongest electric heater in this list. There are some stronger 7,500-watt models on the market. But the Comfort Zone CZ220 is more than strong enough for most wood workshops.\nIf you need an even stronger heater than 5,000 Watts, I highly recommend getting a propane heater over a 7,500 Watts electric heater. The running cost of electric heaters is much higher (for the same heat) than that of a propane heater.\nFor a 5,000 Watts heater, you’re going to pay $0.85 in heating cost per hour (5kW × $0.17 per kWh). An equivalent propane heater would cost $0.46 per hour.\nIf cost matters, prefer propane over electricity. But if you prefer low maintenance and time-saving, get this heavy-duty electric heater.\n4. Mr. Heater Big Maxx (Propane Gas, 50,000 BTU) Another great heater for large wood workshops is the Mr. Heater Big Maxx (click to view it on amazon). It outputs a full 50,000 BTU of heat per hour.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Maxx is a large ceiling-mounted gas heater, compatible with natural gas and propane (conversion kit is included).\nThe Mr. Heater Big Maxx is not a standalone system. It requires access to electricity to be able to run the built-in thermostat (regular wall outlet), the built-in blower, and the electric auto ignition.\nIt also comes in 80,000 BTU and 125,000 BTU variants, but these are usually too large for regular wood workshops.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Maxx is the best heater for large wood workshops.\nEven though the Mr. Heater Big Maxx is a propane heater, it does not work without electricity, so it is not laid out for emergency heating.\nThe combination of electric and gas-based heating is an advantage. You combine cheap gas power with the precise control and safety capabilities of an electric heater.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Maxx is ideal for wood workshops the size of 3, 4, or more cars. With it, you’ll be able to heat uninsulated wood workshops to a comfortable temperature.\nThe 50,000 BTU/h heating power makes up for any heat loss quickly.\n5. Mr. Heater Big Buddy (Propane, 18,000 BTU) The last heater in this list is a portable propane heater. It’s the Mr. Heater Big Buddy (click here to view it on amazon).\nThe Mr. Heater Buddy models are the most popular portable propane heaters. So, they can’t miss in this list.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Buddy is the strongest of the Buddy models and outputs 18,000 BTU/h of heating power.\nIt’s got a similar heat output as a heavy-duty electric heater but requires no installation.\nAnd on top of that, it costs less to run than an electric heater (see more electric vs propane heater differences).\nAnd finally, the Mr. Heater Big Buddy requires no electricity to run, and is portable. The combination of all these makes it a perfect backup heater for emergencies.\nOn top of that, the Mr. Heater Big Buddy is dust-safe, since it doesn’t blow air and, therefore doesn’t clog over time. And any dust settling on it quickly burns off or is carried away by the hot air rising from the Mr. Heater Buddy.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Buddy is my favorite portable propane heater.\nThe Mr. Heater Buddy models come in different sizes. I find the 18,000 BTU Big Buddy model the best choice for most wood workshops, the size of a 2-3 car garage.\nInstead of buying the regular 9,000 BTU Buddy model, you might as well get the 18,000 BTU Big Buddy and run it at half power. Then, if you ever need more heating power, you are prepared.\nThe Big Buddy is completely indoor-safe. In an emergency, you can easily bring it indoors and heat your living space.\nWith the Big Buddy, you can’t go wrong. The only downside is that it can’t be wall- or ceiling-mounted(or at least is not intended to be … ), and therefore will take up some floor or desk space.\nWhich Wood Workshop Heater Should You Pick? The rankings in this list are arbitrary. For some, an electric hardwire installation is not an option, which rules out the heavy-duty electric heater. For others, a regular electric heater is too weak and additionally strains your wood workshop’s electric circuit, which rules out the Dr. Infrared heater.\nSo, the heater that’s best for you is going to be a very personal choice.\nHowever:\nThe wall-mounted Dyna-Glo propane heater is a safe choice for most wood workshops. It provides enough heat to keep you comfortable in deep winter, doesn’t take up floor space, and doesn’t wear down due to dust. It even works without electricity.\nYou can’t go wrong with a wall-mounted propane heater in a wood workshop. If you are not sure which heater to pick, get the Dyna-Glo and see whether you like it.\nIf you have a large wood workshop, you can’t go wrong with the Mr. Heater Big Maxx.\nIt uses some electricity, but won’t interfere with your electric power tools. It’s just a blower and a thermostat, which amounts to something in the ballpark of 60 Watts.\nConclusion In conclusion, finding the right heater for a wood workshop is crucial for creating a safe and comfortable working environment.\nThroughout this article, we have explored both gas and electric heaters, each with their distinct advantages and potential drawbacks.\nGas heaters such as the Dyna-Glo Wall-mounted Heater and the Mr. Heater Big Maxx, are powerful and reliable heaters. The Dyna-Glo is well-suited for a range of workshop sizes and the latter for larger spaces.\nThese heaters are ideal for those seeking high heat output and can work independently of the electric grid, making them reliable even during power outages, though they require propane refills and installation.\nElectric heaters, such as the Dr. Infrared DR-998 and the Comfort Zone CZ220, provide ease of use, lower maintenance, and the added benefit of moisture control, which can be crucial for woodwork.\nWhile they may not offer the raw heating power of gas heaters and are dependent on the electrical system, they are often more convenient to install and use in smaller spaces.\nUltimately, the best heater for your wood workshop will depend on the size of the space, your access to electricity and gas, the level of insulation, and your specific heating needs.\nWhether you opt for a heavy-duty electric heater for its simplicity and control or a powerful gas heater for its heat output and independence from electricity, safety and the nature of your work should always guide your decision\nWith the right heater, you can focus on wood craftsmanship. Even when it’s freezing cold outside.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-wood-workshop-heaters/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA freezing cold wood workshop is uncomfortable to work in.

Dyna-Glo Wall-mounted Propane Heater The best tiny house heater is a wall-mounted propane heater. In particular, I recommend this 30,000 BTU Dyna-Glo heater (click to view it on amazon).\nPropane heaters are the best overall choice for most tiny houses, because they are cheap to run, simple to maintain \u0026amp; repair, and easy to install.\nAlso, this propane heater requires no electricity to run.\nA wall-mounted propane heater doesn’t take up precious floor space and you can integrate it in any room.\nAnd if you add on the base legs (sold separately), you can easily take it off the wall and move it wherever you need it.\nWith a heating power of 30,000 BTU/h, the Dyna-Glo heater can easily keep your entire tiny home warm \u0026amp; cozy.\nActually, this unit is designed for up to 1,000 sq.ft. living spaces. So, it can heat spaces larger than the average tiny house (\u0026lt; 400 - 600 sq.ft.). But that’s an advantage: The increased heating power makes up for a lack of insulation.\nDyna-Glo heaters output a lot of heat and are very cost-effective! Wall mounted propane heaters are the best pick for tiny houses.\nAnd, of course, you can always adapt the heat setting using the heat knob on the heater. You can pick one of 5 heat output settings.\nPropane heaters, of course, require a propane supply.

You are independent of the electric grid. And cost-wise they are cheaper than electricity, but more expensive than wood.\nI think propane heaters hit the sweet spot in most categories, and I can not think of a single drawback to getting one for your first cold season!\n2. Wood Burning Stove If your tiny house is completely off-grid, there’s no better option than a good wood-burning stove.\nI recommend this US Stove Company Clean Cast iron stove (click to view it on amazon).\nWood is the cheapest heat source, especially if you prepare firewood yourself. Generally, the more work you put in yourself, the cheaper the heating gets.\nThis stove model is designed for spaces up to 900 sq.ft., so it is more than enough for most tiny houses. With a maximum heat output rating of up to 54,000 BTU (in perfect conditions, with dry wood), it is the strongest tiny house heater in this list.\nSince it’s a cast iron stove, it’s practically indestructible and lasts a lifetime.\nAlso, the heat it outputs is completely dry. This keeps mold away, and you can even dry laundry inside.\nHowever, a cast iron stove is not ideal for every tiny house. It takes up precious floor space. You need to clean the ashes every day. You need to drill a hole through the wall to install a stove pipe. And preparing firewood is a lot of effort.\nA wood-burning stove is a great choice for a cabin-like off-grid lifestyle. But anywhere within the confines of civilization, I’d rather get a propane heater.\n3. Dr. Infrared DR-998 The least maintenance of all is an electric space heater. I recommend this Dr. Infrared DR-998 heater(click here to view it on amazon).\nIt’s an infrared heater that outputs directional heat. An infrared heater radiates its heat in one direction (ideally at you), which makes you feel very warm while consuming very little electric energy.\nYou can learn more about how infrared heaters work here.\nThe Dr. Infrared infrared heater requires no setup and no installation. All you need is a wall outlet to power it from.\nThe Dr. Infrared DR-998 is one of my favorite infrared heaters.\nAlso, the heat an infrared heater outputs is just as dry as that of a wood stove. Which is an advantage in humid climates.\nElectric heaters generally have the highest running cost due to high electricity rates. Also, they don’t output nearly as much heat as gas or wood-based heaters.\nInfrared heaters are limited to a maximum power output of 1,500 Watts (which is equivalent to 5,120 BTU/h).\nI recommend an electric space heater for tiny house sizes up to 400 sq.ft. For tiny houses larger than that, a propane heater would be the better choice.\nAnyways, an electric infrared heater requires virtually no time investment, no maintenance, no refills (as in gas or wood heaters), and no cleaning. But it is more expensive to run.\nThe DR-998 is a great choice for your first tiny house winter.\nMy recommendation: Get one and just try it. It’s the simplest solution of all. And if your energy bills get too high, you can switch to a propane heater anytime and keep the infrared heater as a backup heater.\n4. Dr. Infrared Wall-mounted Heater Positioning matters, especially in a tiny house. The Dr. Infrared heater in the previous section is a great heater choice. But since it’s a free-standing heater, it takes up some floor space.\nIn case of floor space is limited, you should get a wall-mounted infrared heater that radiates heat downward and into the room.\nI recommend getting this wall-mountable Dr. Infrared heater (click to view it on amazon).\nIt also comes with a tripod, so you can take it off the wall and freely place it wherever you need it.\nBut if you only want to wall-mount the heater, you can also order the heater-only version that does not include a tripod and save some money.\nThis infrared heater outputs 1,500 Watts (~5,120BTU/h) of heating power and is strong enough for most moderately sized tiny homes.\n5. Dyson Hot+Cool Heater Last on this list is the Dyson Hot+Cool HP07 (click to view it on amazon).\nI have a love-hate relationship with Dyson heaters.\nFirst and foremost, I hate their prices. Many Dyson Hot+Cool models are $500 and upwards. That’s a huge expense.\nBut I love the value Dyson packs into their heaters. With the Dyson Hot+Cool, you not only get a 2,000 Watts heater, but also a fan with an integrated air purifier, and detailed air quality and temperature monitoring.\nDyson heaters look nice and purify the air to ensure a smell-free home.\nAnd it’s not like Dyson just jumbles up features and creates a half-baked product. Dyson Hot+Cool fans are fundamentally good heaters, good air purifiers (with the best air quality monitoring out there), and good fans.\nIf you value design and engineering, a Dyson Hot+Cool fan is for you. It’s a complete solution for your tiny house\u0026rsquo;s interior temperature and air quality.\nIf you have extra money to spend, the Dyson is for you. A Dyson Hot+Cool fan takes care of your tiny house’s temperature and air quality, removes smells, and looks good.\nBy the way: Removing smells comes in handy in a tiny house. You don’t want guests entering a swamp of kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom smells.\nBut you might as well get a separate heater and air purifier and save some money. Find the best tiny house air purifiers here.\nWhich Heater is Best For Your Tiny House? I’ve picked the best tiny house heaters. Now it’s up to you to choose one from the list. But let me simplify the decision for you.\nThese 3 heaters are risk-free choices:\nIf you want no maintenance and little cost, get the Dr. Infrared-DR998. If you want an all-in-one heater, air purifier (for smell removal), fan, and air quality monitor, get the Dyson Hot+Cool. If you want high heat, independent of the electric grid, get the Dyna-Glo propane heater. Wood, Propane, or Electric: Should You Pick a Tiny House Heater Based on Running Cost? It does not matter which heater you pick. Regardless of the heater, in a tiny house you save heating costs as compared to a regular-sized house. Picking a specific heat source (electric, wood, propane) is merely an additional optimization.\nTiny houses are - as the name suggests - tiny. And so is their heating cost.\nDue to the limited space to heat, the heating cost is also very limited.\nIn a large family home, the choice of heater has a significant impact on monthly expenses, in a tiny house. Over the course of a year, in a regular family home, your choice of heater makes an annual expense difference in the range of thousands of dollars.\nBut in a tiny home, it does not really matter whether you heat with wood, electricity, or propane.\nSurely, wood remains much cheaper than electricity. But heating a tiny home using an electric heater is not as expensive as heating a regular-scale house.\nScale matters.\nFor your first winter, don’t focus on heating costs. First, just get any heater as a starting point.\nAnd based on the experience with your first heater, adjust for the following seasons.\nConclusion The best tiny house heaters are Dyna-Glo propane heaters and electric Dr. Infrared heaters.\nThey require next to no maintenance and are strong enough to heat a tiny house.\nWhile a propane heater does not strain your tiny house’s electric circuitry, it does require occasional propane refills.\nAn electric infrared heater requires even less maintenance. You just plug it in a wall outlet and it’s ready to heat.\nElectric heating is more expensive than propane-based heating. However, electric heaters save you time and come with more safety features.\nIt does not really matter which heater you pick. Any of them will work. Just pick one and start heating.\nAnd don’t worry about heating expenses. In a tiny house, they will be tiny as well. Picking one heater over the other because of heating expenses is more than often a waste of time. At least in your first winter.\nMore important is reliability and ease of use.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-tiny-house-heaters/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe first cold season in a tiny house is exciting.

For some, it won’t start, other times, it keeps stopping, and sometimes the timer is stuck and not counting down.\nAny of these problems make a full deep clean cycle impossible.\nIn this article, we’re going to check out several different solutions for your Dyson humidifier’s deep clean cycle not working.\nWhat is the Deep Clean Cycle and why do you need it? Deep cleaning is the process of removing limescale by dissolving it with citric acid.\nRegular deep clean cycles are needed because limestone builds up inside your unit, clogging it and preventing it from running.\nThe frequency of deep cleaning cycles depends on the hardness of your water. The higher the hardness, the faster limestone builds up.\nDyson recommends a deep clean once a month. But you don’t have to keep track of the deep clean schedule manually.\nYour Dyson Humidify fan notifies you when the deep clean is due, either through the app or via the LCD screen.\nBut if you want, you can manually initiate the deep clean cycle yourself monthly.\nWhat are the problems with the Deep Clean Cycle? There are several different symptoms of deep clean cycle problems.:\nThe deep clean cycle countdown timer stops on its own after a few seconds The deep clean cycle countdown timer resumes after unplugging the device, but after a few seconds it freezes again The deep clean cycle takes much longer than 1 hour (up to \u0026gt;24 hours) You don’t get automatic prompts to deep clean your Dyson humidifier Dyson customer support forwards to a generic cleaning video that doesn’t address the source of the problem.\nIf the deep clean cycle doesn\u0026rsquo;t work following the official instructions, something needs fixing.\nHow to Fix the Dyson Humidify Deep Clean Cycle Fixing a broken deep clean cycle is possible. Here’s what I recommend to try ( in order):\n1. Force the Deep Clean Cycle First of all, if the automatic deep clean cycle doesn’t work, try a forced deep clean cycle and see whether it makes a difference.\nTo force a deep clean cycle, quickly press the deep clean cycle button three times.\nA deep clean cycle should start now. See whether it works or not.\nIf it doesn’t work, continue.\n2. Dissolve Citric Acid Manually Don’t follow Dyson’s official instructions for dissolving citric acid.\nDon’t just gently shake the water + citric acid solution inside the tank.\nInstead, stir the citric acid + water solution in the tank manually, either with your hand, a spoon, or a whisk.\nStir the citric acid solution manually until every citric acid crystal is dissolved. Ideally, you see no powdery / crystalline particles in the solution anymore.\nCitric acid particles mustn’t clog the pump nozzle, which is critical for the deep clean cycle to work.\nForce a deep clean cycle and see if it works. If it doesn’t continue:\n3. Clean the Pump Column Base Cap A potential reason for the deep clean cycle not working is residue on the pump.\nOpen the tank lid and turn it upside down, so the pump column protrudes upwards.\nThe filter screen on the base cap filters water and blocks small particles and algae from entering the pump.\nRemove the column base cap using the small notch (left side of the image), and clean the screen (right side of the image).\nWarning: Don\u0026rsquo;t turn a wet pump upside down to prevent water damage to the internal circuitry. Dry before.\nClean the pump base cap screen:\nRemove the column base cap using the small notch Rinse the base cap thoroughly. You can use dish soap to help with this. Clean the screen by brushing it gently, but thoroughy with a toothbrush. Reinsert the column base cap. Before attaching the lid again, dry it properly. The electronics inside the lid mustn’t be exposed to water at any time.\nForce a deep clean cycle and see if it works. If not, continue:\n4. Hard Reset your Dyson Humidifier Hard reset your Dyson humidifying fan. A hard reset recalibrates sensors, which can fix the deep clean cycle.\nHold the power button on your Dyson fan and on the remote simultaneously for 10 seconds. If you lost your remote, get a new replacement remote (click to see Dyson Humidify remotes on amazon). A countdown animation appears on the LCD screen. Wait for the countdown animation to finish.\nAfter that, your Dyson fan is reset.\nTurn it on and wait for the values (temperature, humidity, air quality) to update. Due to the recalibration, this might take up to an hour.\nThen, try a forced deep clean cycle. If it still doesn’t work, continue with the next section.\n5. Send in Dyson under Warranty Dyson humidifiers have 2 years guarantee. As long as you’re within the guarantee period, Dyson will repace or repair your humidifier fan.\nContact Dyson customer support and ask them how to continue with this issue.\nIf you are outside of the warranty period, you’re on your own. Continue with the next section then.\n6. Replace the Water Pump Column Buy a replacement pump column for your Dyson purifier humidifier. Unfortunately, I found no good source of replacement parts, apart from Dyson.\nOriginal replacement pump columns are available on Dyson’s spare parts page.\nReplacing the pump column should be as easy as removing the old column and placing the new one on the tank.\nNo electronics skills required.\nForce a deep clean cycle. If that doesn’t help, continue with the next section.\n7. Manually Deep Clean your Dyson If none of the previous solutions got your deep clean cycle working, I assume there’s some fundamental issue with your Dyson humidifier’s software / sensors or pump that is not straightforward to solve.\nYou can still work around the issue.\nOf course, you can manually deep clean your Dyson humidifier. There’s no technical need for a Dyson humidifier to clean itself automatically.\nManually deep clean your Dyson humidifier as follows:\nClean the tank by scrubbing it with an acidic solution (citric acid or distilled vinegar + water) Clean the pump screen (as described earlier) by taking off the tank lid and scrubbing the screen gently with dish soap. You can also use an acidic solution here. Clean the inside of the pump column. Disassemble your Dyson purifier humidifier, taking off the base and opening up the fan blades. Wipe the inside housing of your Dyson humidifier. Wipe the fan blades. Reassemble your Dyson humidifier. 8. Use your Dyson with Distilled Water If your Dyson humidifier is not able to perform a full deep clean cycle on its own, use distilled water.\nWith distilled water, the tank / pump column and nozzles never need a deep clean.\nDistilled water doesn’t contain any limestone. So, limestone doesn’t build up and it doesn’t clog your Dyson humidifier over time.\nDistilled water is, however, very expensive: A 6-pack of 16.9oz (500ml) bottles) costs around $20.\n( I checked online, a full gallon of distilled water found in a local hardware store is surely cheaper )\nDepending on your Dyson humidifier usage, one pack of distilled water bottles would last you between 1-3 months.\nEspecially if you are using your Dyson humidifier for more than an hour a day, I recommend getting a distilled water maker.\nThese cost somewhere around $80, but will pay for themselves after just a few months.\nI recommend getting this CO-Z distilled water maker (click to view it on amazon).\nBasically, with a distilled water maker you move the limestone buildup problem from your Dyson humidifier into the distilled water maker. The distilled water maker will then require occasional cleanings (with citric acid or vinegar) but without any of the technical complications of a Dyson humidifier.\nConclusion: What to do if you can’t get the Deep Clean Cycle to Work? That’s it. That was the full list of steps to either fix the deep clean cycle, or at least work around it.\nIf you can’t solve the deep clean cycle issue, just ignore it and use distilled water with your Dyson humidifier - problem avoided.\nIf none of the fixes worked for you and you don’t want to rely on workarounds and you want to use your Dyson humidifier with regular tap water, you, unfortunately, have to replace the entire device.\nI recommend getting the Dyson Purifier Humidify+Cool Formaldehyde™ PH04 (click to see it on amazon).\nIt is more expensive than other Dyson fans, but this one comes with the ability to filter toxic gases and has in-depth air quality monitoring, which makes it worth it.\nConclusion Usually, you can fix your Dyson humidifier’s deep clean cycle not working through forcing it, or a hard reset of your device. If that doesn’t work, there is a hardware problem. Ensure you dissolve the citric acid properly (stir it manually). Clean the pump column base cap to improve water flow into the pump, or replace the pump entirely.\nIf none of these work, do a last manual deep clean (scrubbing the Dyson with citric acid), and continue using your humidifier with distilled water.\nWith these solutions, you should be able to get your Dyson humidifier working again!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fix-dyson-deep-clean-cycle-not-working/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe deep clean cycle on Dyson humidifiers is known to have several problems.

This is both frustrating and dangerous.\nBut don’t worry - you’ve landed in the right place. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll have a look at why your kettle keeps boiling (there are just 4 possible reasons) and how to fix each of the causes.\nWhile writing this article, I discovered that kettles are actually incredibly easy to fix. At most, you’re going to need a screwdriver and a replacement switch (which costs just a few dollars).\nAnd that’s the worst case!\nIn 3 out of 4 cases, you need no tools at all.\nSo, anyone can fix an electric kettle.\nI’m Daniel, an electrical engineer, and I like to take things apart. For this article, I disassembled my kettle and found out how it works.\nLet’s have a look.\nSafety Info for Kettle Repair Before attempting to repair your electric kettle, thoroughly dry it with a towel and unplug it.\nDo not repair it while it’s standing on its base station.\nGenerally, electric kettles are safe to repair since they don’t store any power. So, as soon as you lift them off the base, they are without electricity.\nHow to Fix Your Electric Kettle that Keeps Boiling Now that you’re prepared, let’s have a look at how to fix your electric kettle and get it to shut off properly.\n1. Fix the Lid / Close it Firmly The very first thing you should make sure when using your electric kettle is to close the lid firmly when boiling water.\nPress the lid down until it clicks into place. If the lid on your kettle doesn’t click nicely into place, check the lid’s mounting axis. Is it broken, or are there any obstructions? Fix it.\nThe lid needs to fit neatly onto the kettle and seal it properly.\nHere’s why:\nElectric Kettles can’t shut off with an Open Lid Electric kettles rely on a steam sensor. The steam sensor detects when water boils and cuts off the heating element.\nWith an open lid, hot steam escapes the kettle and the heating element keeps heating.\nMake sure the lid is properly closed and fix any issue that prevents you from properly closing it.\nThis is the small hole inside which the steam sensor sits. With an open lid, not enough steam enters the hole and your electric kettle keeps boiling forever.\n2. Replace Bimetal Switch The “steam sensor switch” we just talked about in the previous section sits right below the ON/OFF button.\nIt is actually very simple:\nHot steam from the boiling water leaves your kettle\u0026rsquo;s main chamber through a small steam escape hole.\nThat hole forwards the steam to a small black box sitting below the ON/OFF button inside your electric kettle’s handle.\nInside (or below) that black box, there is a small piece of metal that is actually two different kinds of metal glued together.\nWhen the hot steam heats up this bimetallic metal piece, the two sheets of metal bend at different rates, which causes tension to build up. And exactly when water reaches the boiling point, the bimetal switch is so hot that it bends sharply (which is the clicking sound you can hear), which closes a shutoff circuit and cuts off the heating element.\nSome electric kettles have multiple such switches, but usually, the one controlling the boiling-point shutoff is the one inside the handle.\nUnscrew the screws holding your electric kettle\u0026rsquo;s handle together. Inside the handle sits the sensor that needs replacement.\nTo fix your kettle that keeps boiling, replace the boiling-point switch. Unscrew the top of the handle to uncover the black switch box. Remove the old switch by unscrewing it and disconnecting the wires.\nInsert the new switch, screw it in place, and connect the two power wires.\nI recommend getting these replacement bimetal switches for electric kettles (click to view them on amazon).\nAlternatively, you can harvest a replacement switch from an old electric kettle that still works! Usually, they are one-size fits all.\nThe black sensor box below the switch contains the steam sensor. When the steam sensor switches, it switches the main power (I/O) off.\n3. Check and Adjust Thermostat Settings Some new kettles come with a precise thermostat that heats the water until the desired target temperature is reached.\nSome electric kettles even keep the temperature at target temperature for a defined time span (e.g. 60 minutes).\nIf your kettle keeps boiling and it has a thermostat control, there are two potential issues:\nthe temperature sensor underestimates current temperature, causing your kettle to keep boiling - but water can’t get hotter than 100°C (at ambient air pressure), causing your kettle to keep boiling the thermostat is set to keep heating the water - and possibly, your electric kettle keeps heating the water at boiling point. The continued heating might be a special button or setting on your kettle. Make sure it’s not active. In any case, test your kettle with lower thermostat settings and see if it cuts off the heating then.\nIf it doesn’t, probably the thermostat itself or the thermostat’s temperature sensor is broken.\nUsually, these parts are very manufacturer-specific.\nIf your kettle keeps boiling even with low thermostat settings, I recommend just buying a new kettle (see the next section).\n4. Descale the Heating Element The last possible cause for a kettle boiling longer than necessary is limestone buildup on the heating element.\nResidue from hard water can cause the heating element to overheat, which, in turn, keeps the water boiling.\nThis is a stark contrast from the other issues we looked at so far! While the previous issues keep your kettle boiling endlessly, limestone in your kettle will just lengthen the boiling period.\nLimestone does not cause your electric kettle to boil without shutting off at some point. It just causes it to boil longer after the shutoff point.\nYou can prevent this by regularly descaling the kettle with solutions like white vinegar or a commercial descaling product.\nWhat to Do If You Can’t Fix Your Electric Kettle? If you can’t fix your kettle, because you lack the skills and tools, and it costs too much time and nerves, just buy a new kettle.\nKettles are very affordable and there’s no reason to waste hours trying to fix a product you can replace for a couple of dollars.\nI recommend getting this Electric Kettle from Amazon Basics (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt’s cheap and it works. And it doesn’t come with a fancy thermostat that, if it fails, makes the whole kettle useless.\nI prefer simple electric kettles that shut off at boiling point. These are incredibly simple to repair. The worst that can happen is a shutoff switch replacement (as described earlier).\nBut usually, these simple kettles easily last a decade before you have to worry about replacing them.\nMy recommendation if you can’t fix your electric kettle: Just get a new one.\nConclusion If your electric kettle keeps boiling and doesn’t shut off, it’s usually an open lid or a faulty shutoff switch. Make sure you close the lid properly and, if necessary, replace the shutoff switch, and your electric kettle should be working again.\nIf you don’t want to fix your electric kettle, just buy a new one. Buying a new one costs you next to nothing and saves you precious time that you’d spend repairing the broken kettle.\nIn any case, I hope this article was helpful! I learned something about kettles along the way and I hope you did too!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fix-electric-kettle-keeps-boiling-doesnt-shut-off/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour electric kettle keeps boiling and doesn’t shut off?

It doesn’t turn on? Or it turns on, but the fan doesn’t blow? Or it turns on, but shuts off on its own after some time?\nIn this article, I’ll show you simple fixes for these scenarios.\nHi, I am Daniel, an electrical engineer who did electronic repairs professionally in the past.\nLuckily, heat storm heaters are comparably simple devices. They don’t have that many components that can break.\nSo, I bet you will be able to fix your heater after reading this guide thoroughly. Even without much repair skills.\nLet’s check your heater, starting with the power supply:\nHow to Fix Your Heat Storm Heater This fixing guide covers all Heat Storm models, including the Heat Storm Phoenix (click to view it on amazon), wall-mounted Heat Storm heaters, and Heat Storm infrared panel heaters.\nSafety reminder:\nBefore we dive into troubleshooting, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to prioritize your safety. Always disconnect your heater from the power source before inspecting or handling it to prevent any risk of electric shock or injury. It\u0026rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry, so take this precaution every time\n1. Check Power Supply If your Heat Storm heater is not turning on at all, make sure your wall outlet works. You can test it using a different device and see if that turns on.\nIf the wall outlet works, good. Else, test your heat storm heater on another wall outlet, ideally, on a separate electric circuit (as far away from the original wall outlet as possible).\nTest it in a different room on a different floor, in the garage, or in a friend\u0026rsquo;s house.\nIf your heater works there, the issue is in your electric circuit at home.\nCheck your electric service box for blown fuses or tripped circuit breakers.\n2. Clean Air Filters / Run Without Filters Clogged air filters can cause your Heat Storm heater to overheat and shut off on its own. This affects all Heat Storm models with a built-in blower, such as the Heat Storm Phoenix.\nIf your Heat Storm heater doesn’t have air filters, skip this section.\nRemove the filter cover on both sides of your Heat Storm heater and take out the air filters.\nTurn on your Heat Storm heater. Does it work now?\nIf it works now without shutting off, the air filters cause overheating.\nThoroughly wash the filters, and see if it works with clean filters. Else, you can also run your Heat Storm heater without air filters. However this will cause internal dust buildup over the years that you may have to clean out every season.\nBut if it gets your Heat Storm heater running again, it’s a useful workaround.\n3. Clean Out Dust Open up your Heat Storm heater and check for dust. Dust causes the heater to overheat and shut off on its own.\nClean out the dust. For dusting, I recommend getting this Craftsman air compressor(click here to view it on amazon).\nAn air compressor is invaluable for heater maintenance. And you can use it for cleaning out your car, inflating tires, and all kinds of other maintenance tasks. It’s an investment that pays in the long run.\nIdeally, your Heat Storm heater\u0026rsquo;s inside should look like the picture above: No dust at all. Make sure the squirrel cage fan blades are clean!\n4. Check Tip-Over Protection All Heat Storm heaters come with a built-in tip-over protection. That is, when the heater tips over, stands on an uneven surface, or is mounted at a skewed angle, it stops heating and doesn’t turn on.\nMake sure the heater is level with the floor.\nIf it still doesn’t turn on, your tip-over protection might be stuck. Give your Heat Storm heater a firm smack with the palm of your hand to release the stuck tip-over protection.\nYou can think of the tip-over protection as an inverse pendulum. Only when your heater stands level with the ground, the inverse pendulum balances. Otherwise, it tips over to either side, hitting an electric contact and closing a protection circuit.\n5. Hard Reset / Recalibrate It If your Heat Storm heater is not heating as expected or showing odd thermostat temperatures, it needs to be recalibrated.\nThe safest way to force a new calibration is a hard reset.\nWhile pressing and holding the power button on the device:\nUnplug the device Wait 30 seconds Plug it back it Release the power button only after the device is plugged it.\nPlease note this does not work with the remote control. You need to press the power button on the device.\n6. Check Fan / Blower Motor If your Heat Storm heater does not blow air, check the fan motor. To do that, disassemble the heater, open up the front or back panel (depending on the model) and inspect the motor.\nDoes it rotate freely? If not, there may be a blocking part stuck in the fan blades you need to remove. Make sure your heater is unplugged before working on the fan motor.\nIf it does rotate freely, check the power supply to the motor. Are all wires attached?\nIf you have some electronics skills, check the voltage to the motor with a multimeter. Does the blower motor receive input power?\n7. Inspect Electric Circuitry If your Heat Storm heater still doesn’t work, inspect the electric circuitry. Set a timer and take 10-15 minutes and inspect the circuit board, wire connections, and the heating element.\nLook out for blown parts, burn marks, and disconnected wires.\nThese are usually easy to spot and occur frequently in electric heaters.\nOnce you locate the broken or blown part, find out its specification. Read it from the label on the part. You can use the internet to find more info about parts with just a serial number on them.\nIf the label is not readable due to burn marks, look for a matching part in the circuitry nearby. Usually, electronic parts are used several times in the same circuitry.\nTo repair the electronic circuitry, buy a matching replacement part online. Unsolder the damaged part and put the new part in place.\nAfter going through all these steps, your Heat Storm heater should be working again.\nCheck the electronic circuitry inside your Heat Storm heater. Check for burn marks. And, if you can, you can manually test the two relais by applying a small voltage to them (for experts only!).\nWhat to do if You Can’t Fix your Heat Storm Heater? If you can’t fix your heater, either because you lack the knowledge and skills to do so, or because you can’t find the root cause of the issue, I recommend buying a new heater.\nMy recommendation for a new infrared heater is the Dr. Infrared Dr-968. It’s an infrared heater, just like the Heat Storm heater, but has a sturdier wooden case, so it is not as easily damaged.\nAlso, it does not come with smart home integration, so there’s less room for problems.\nGenerally, whether to pick a Heat Storm or a Dr. Infrared is a matter of design preference. Both are solid choices.\nBut I prefer simple \u0026amp; sturdy heaters that heat reliably and don’t break down over time.\nConclusion A Heat Storm heater not working is usually simple to fix. Heat Storm heaters have very few parts, so there is not much that can break.\nUsually, Heat Storm heaters stop working when they accumulate dust, which causes them to overheat, or when there’s an issue with the electronics (power supply, calibration, fan motor).\nIn each of these cases, it makes sense to open up your Heat Storm heater and have a look inside. Usually, you can see the root issue quite quickly.\nIf there’s dust, clean it out. If the fan is blocked, unblock it. And if you see a blown part in the circuitry, replace it.\nIf you can’t repair your broken Heat Storm heater due to lacking skills or tools, I recommend just buying a new space heater. Space heaters are not very expensive. And a replacement is usually cheaper than a professional repair.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fix-heat-storm-heater-not-working/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour heat storm heater is not working?

They don’t have that many components that can break.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Heat Storm Heater Not Working: How to Fix It"},{"content":"Your Dyson fan suddenly shows wrong air quality reports and / or a wrong temperature?\nOftentimes, the air quality report shows a 999 value and the temperature shows 0°C (or °K).\nOr the air quality report and temperature are stuck at a certain value, or they don’t show values at all.\nThis usually indicates a problem with the air quality and temperature sensor. Usually, the problem is easy to fix and requires just a few minutes of your time.\nHow to Fix Your Dyson Fan Reporting Wrong Air Quality / Temperature Data Here’s how to fix your Dyson fan reporting nonsensical air quality and temperature.\n1. Reset To Factory Settings The first thing you should do is reset your Dyson fan to factory settings. A reset to factory settings forces the air quality and temperature sensors to recalibrate, which oftentimes solves the issue.\nHow to Reset your Dyson to Factory Settings To reset your Dyson fan to factory settings, hold the power button on the device and on the remote simultaneously for 10 seconds.\nWait for the 10-second countdown animation on your Dyson fan display to disappear.\nInitially, after the reset, some air quality readings may not show, because the fan needs time to calibrate again.\nLet the fan run for an hour to self-calibrate.\nThen, check the different air quality / temperature / humidity displays.\nThe values should be correct now.\nIf they aren’t, continue with the next section.\nWhy does a Reset to Factory Settings work? The air quality and temperature sensors in your Dyson fan send electrical pulses that are converted to a meaningful air quality value and temperature. This conversion is called calibration.\nAnd if the mathematical calibration function in your Dyson fan’s software uses wrong parameters to convert electric signals to air quality and temperature values on your Dyson’s display, it will display nonsensical values (999 air quality, 0° temperature).\nAfter a reset, Dyson fans self-calibrate and establish new calibration parameters. This usually fixes the problem with wrong air quality and temperature readings.\n2. Clean Air Quality and Temperature Sensor If your Dyson fan still shows odd air quality and temperature readings after a factory reset, likely the air quality and temperature sensors are clogged.\nWhen dust and grease settle on the sensors, they can’t measure air pollution and temperature properly anymore.\nHow to Clean Dyson Fan Sensors To fix it clean the pollution and air quality sensors of your Dyson fan.\nDyson fan air quality and temperature sensors sit inside these two openings\nThe sensors sit inside the two long and narrow opening slits in the side of the fan housing, above the air inlet holes.\nUsing a vacuum cleaner: Point a vacuum cleaner at the sensor openings to remove the dust. I recommend using a narrow vacuum attachment, optionally with a brush attached. Without an attachment, the air stream is not as focused and you risk scratching your Dyson fan. Using Q-tips and rubbing alcohol: Soak a Q-tip in rubbing alcohol and clean the sensor opening with it.\nRubbing alcohol dissolves grease.\nThe Q-tip + rubbing alcohol method is preferable to a vacuum cleaner when your Dyson fan is very dirty, since it removes residue more effectively. Blow into the sensor openings: The quickest, but least thorough method is to just blow into the sensor openings. In case of light clogging a strong blow is already enough. After cleaning the sensors, turn on your Dyson fan. The air quality and temperature readings should work properly now.\nIf the values are still off, possibly your Dyson fan’s calibration is off due to the previous clogging.\nIn this case, do a reset to factory settings by pressing the power button on the device and on the remote control simultaneously for 10 seconds (as described in the previous section).\n3. Replace Dyson Fan If neither the reset to factory settings nor the sensor cleaning works, replace your Dyson fan.\nWithin Warranty: Request Refund Dyson fans have a 2-year warranty. Within that period, Dyson will repair or replace your Dyson fan.\nIf you’re within the warranty period, contact Dyson support and request a replacement.\nIf you bought your Dyson fan from Amazon, or a similar store, you can also contact the store you bought it from and request a refund or replacement.\nIn most cases, you’ll get it. The newer your Dyson fan is, the better your chances are.\nOutside of Warranty: Sell Broken Fan and Buy a New One If your Dyson fan is older than 2 years I recommend selling your defective fan. There are plenty of fixing \u0026amp; flipping businesses looking for broken Dyson fans to repair and sell for a profit.\nSo, on any large online marketplace, you’ll get a competitive price.\nAlso, make sure to mention that your Dyson fan is working fine, only the sensor readings are off / not working.\nThat indicates to a professional repairman that the issue is easy to fix, resulting in more money for you.\nWith the money you get, buy a new Dyson fan. Usually, this approach is much more cost-effective than doing your own repair.\nI recommend getting the Dyson Hot+Cool HP10 (click here to view it on amazon).\nConclusion Fixing the problem with the wrong air quality and temperature report is very easy. Usually, a hard reset and / or sensor cleaning suffices.\nTo fix the Dyson air quality / temperature problem, reset to factory settings, holding both power buttons (on remote and fan) for 10 seconds. Then, clean the fan sensors with a vacuum or rubbing alcohol + Q-tip.\nIf these fixes don’t work for you, request a replacement fan, if you’re within the warranty period. Else, sell your fan as broken, and buy a new one.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fix-dyson-wrong-air-quality-temperature/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour Dyson fan suddenly shows wrong air quality reports and / or a wrong temperature?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOftentimes, the air quality report shows a 999 value and the temperature shows 0°C (or °K).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr the air quality report and temperature are stuck at a certain value, or they don’t show values at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis usually indicates a problem with the air quality and temperature sensor.

I’ve worked in a large repair department of an electronics company before. Let’s have a look at what’s going on together.\nWhat causes your Dyson fan to suddenly show the Warning Triangle\nDyson fans show the warning triangle with the exclamation mark when there is an issue in the electric circuitry.\nThe warning sign issue frequently occurs in brand-new Dyson fans out of the box.\nLikely, Dyson fans with the warning triangle error were not properly handled in Dyson’s quality control or were damaged during transport.\nThe warning sign has nothing to do with:\nthe filter (as long as it’s reasonably clean) the remote control the power supply How to Fix the Dyson Warning Triangle The Dyson warning triangle error is usually easy to clear. Here’s how:\n1. Lower Fan Speed Before the Warning Triangle Shows Oftentimes, the warning triangle error occurs when the fan speed is set to 10 (highest), and the Dyson fan is turned off afterward.\nWhen you turn on your Dyson fan then, it immediately starts blowing air at the highest possible fan speed, which possibly overloads the electric circuitry.\nThis issue is oftentimes introduced by Dyson’s quality control team. Dyson quality control employees have to reset the fan to a low-moderate fan speed before boxing it up. When you turn on your brand-new Dyson fan and it starts at fan speed 10, Dyson’s quality control team skipped a step in the quality control procedure.\nOf course, you can also create the issue yourself when you run your Dyson fan at the highest possible setting and shut it off.\nHow to fix it Turn on your Dyson fan and before the warning triangle shows, quickly lower the fan speed.\nHow to prevent it To prevent this issue in the future, lower your fan speed before turning your Dyson fan off.\n2. Clean Start by Holding the Power Button on the Remote and Fan Simultaneously Another potential cause of the issue can be an issue with the onboard software. Oftentimes, a special clean start helps.\nClean start your Dyson fan like this:\nUnplug your Dyson fan from the wall outlet. Press and hold the power button on the device for 10 seconds while the device is unplugged. Plug it back in. Quickly press and hold the power button on the fan and on the remote simultaneously for 10 seconds. 3. Turn the Dyson Fan Upside Down Some people report that flipping the fan upside down while turning it on helps. It’s an odd workaround, but it seems to help sometimes.\nFlip your Dyson fan upside down and turn it on. You might need assistance and have someone hold it for you.\nDoes the warning triangle error still show?\n4. Warranty: Request a Refund / Replacement Device If nothing helps, request a refund or a replacement device.\nEither contact Dyson support, or, preferably, the store you bought your Dyson fan from.\nUsually, Dyson support tries to go through troubleshooting with you. But they don’t have a clue either and will either replace your device (after endless discussion and calls), or they’ll try to sell you a repair with replacement parts that costs $150.\nSo, contacting shop support is easier.\nThis, of course, only works within the warranty period.\n5. Sell your Dyson Fan as Defective and Buy a New One Only do this if your fan is out of warranty.\nSell your Dyson fan with the warning triangle error online. List it as defective.\nYou can still get a good amount of money since there are many repair \u0026amp; flipping businesses looking for broken Dyson fans.\nThen, spend the money from your sale on a new Dyson fan. The cost of buying a new fan considering the income from selling the broken one can be even lower than that of a repair.\n( The reason for that is that repair businesses specialize in this and can repair Dyson fans quickly and cheaply, so even if they pay you a high price, they’ll still profit - their margin is very low because competition is high )\nAs a replacement fan, I recommend a Dyson Hot+Cool fan. My recommendation is the Dyson Hot+Cool HP10 (click here to view it on amazon).\nConclusion In most cases, you should be able to fix your Dyson fan showing the warning triangle error by quickly lowering the fan speed after turning it on.\nIf that doesn’t work, try the clean start (holding the power button of the remote and the fan at the same time).\nIf you can’t fix your Dyson fan, I recommend either handing your Dyson fan in for a replacement or selling it and buying a new one.\nAll the effort and frustration is oftentimes not worth it. Just getting a new fan is the quickest \u0026amp; safest way to solve the issue.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/dyson-fan-warning-triangle-error-fixes/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen your Dyson fan shows a warning triangle with an exclamation mark, something is wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from the warning triangle, your Dyson fan does not give you any further information about the issue, and no instructions on what to do now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we’ll have a quick look at the warning triangle error, what causes it, and what you should do about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHi, my name is Daniel, I’m an electrical engineer.

I do.\nHere’s the reason for your Dyson fan showing the F2 error:\nSymptom: Dyson fan senses a power drop, displays F2 Cause: Friction in the fan motor Solution: Disassemble and clean the fan, ensure the fan motor is snapped into position, tighten any screws The F2 error is comparably rare because it is related to internal friction inside the device. This usually happens when a Dyson fan is not carefully assembled.\nEither Dyson did not properly quality-control your model, or you tried to fix something on your Dyson fan and missed something in the reassembly, or you bought your Dyson fan used from someone who introduced the issue.\nIn any case, the issue is relatively simple to fix in most cases. With a bit of patience, you can fix it too.\nHow to Reset the F2 Error Code (According to Dyson) Let’s first start with Dyson’s official fixing instructions. It will be obvious why Dyson’s official guide is not enough very soon.\nAccording to Dyson’s customer support, the F2 error is a power issue.\nThey recommend turning the fan off, waiting 60 seconds, and turning it back on. The error should have cleared.\nIf this doesn’t work, try a “hard reset”: Turn off your Dyson fan, unplug it, wait, and then turn it back on.\nIf these steps solve the issue for you, great! However, if your fan, as in most cases, still shows the F2 error, continue with the next section.\nThe Problem with Dyson’s official instructions Dyson knows that the F2 error code represents a power issue. However, they incorrectly conclude that power issues can always be solved by power cycling (turning on and off) or resetting the device.\nObviously, that’s not the solution for the cause of the issue. So, in most cases, Dyson’s official troubleshooting steps are useless.\nHow to Actually Fix The Dyson F2 Error Code Here’s how to actually fix the Dyson F2 error code:\nThe cause of the F2 error code is usually a blocked fan motor. When dust clogs the motor or when the fan blades rub against the housing because it does not sit in position, the rotational resistance of the fan changes, causing the Dyson fan to interpret it as a power issue.\nTo fix the F2 error code unclog the fan motor:\n1. Remove Motor Blockers First of all, unplug and disassemble your Dyson fan. Open up the base, take out the filter, and unscrew the inner case screws until you can access the fan motor.\nCheck the motor for any blockers. Try to rotate it manually (with your hand). Does it rotate easily?\nIf it does not rotate at all and is stuck, find the part that blocks the fan blades and remove it.\nIf you can’t locate the blocking part, unscrew the motor from its base and disconnect the motor power supply so you can hold it freely.\nShake the fan motor and listen for rattling. Try to remove the blocking part.\n2. Remove Dust Causing Friction In case the fan motor rotates, but only with resistance, likely dust is blocking it.\nRemove all the dust from the fan motor.\nFor this, I generally recommend using an air compressor (click to view it on amazon) with a compressed air gun.\nIf you don’t have one yet, get one. Having an air compressor pays off in the long run! Especially for cleaning out dust in electronics. I also use it to inflate car \u0026amp; bike tires, balls, and air mattresses. So, it’s definitely a worthy purchase for any household.\nAll you have to do is point the air gun at the fan motor and blow out all the dust. Takes no more than 10 seconds.\nAlternatively, grab an old toothbrush, or any other brush that does not damage plastic parts, and clean out the dust manually.\nThe fan should rotate freely again.\n3. Tighten Fan Motor Screws Before you reassemble your Dyson fan, check that the motor is snapped into position.\nWhen the fan motor does not sit firmly in its spot, the fan will rub on the inner side of the fan housing.\nIf dust or other mechanical blockers were not the issue in your case, it surely is an improper fan motor assembly.\nI find this issue is as often the cause of the F2 error as dust blocking the motor. The motor usually does not sit firmly in its position because of a previous disassembly with uncareful reassembly (for example from a previous repair), or because Dyson did not properly quality-check your unit.\nEnsure that all screws on the fan motor are fully tightened to force the fan motor into position.\n4. Reassemble and Test your Fan After cleaning out your Dyson fan and ensuring the fan motor sits firmly in position, you can test your Dyson fan.\nPlug in your Dyson fan and turn it on. The F2 error should be gone.\n5. Reset the Dyson fan If the F2 error still shows, press and hold the power button on the remote or on the fan to reset your device.\nYour Dyson fan should be working by now.\nWhat to do if the F2 Error Persists? If the F2 error persists and you can’t get rid of it after applying the fixes from the previous section, likely the fan motor of your Dyson fan is broken.\nThere are two ways to handle it.\nReplace the Fan Motor To fix the broken fan motor in your Dyson, replace it. You can buy a replacement motor online. You can find replacement fan motors on aliexpress.com.\nSearch for your particular Dyson fan model and “fan motor”.\nThe delivery will take a few weeks since they come directly from China. And, of course, you need basic electronics skills to replace the fan motor.\nGet a New Dyson Fan In most cases, however, I recommend buying a new Dyson fan. For a motor replacement, you need skills, time, and nerves.\nI recommend getting this Dyson Hot+Cool HP10 (click to view it on amazon).\nIt’s a Hot+Cool model, meaning it can even heat your room, in addition to cooling (in fan mode) and air purification (in any mode).\nJust getting a new Dyson fan saves you all the repair trouble and you can instantly stop worrying about the F2 error.\nConclusion To fix the F2 error in your Dyson fan, remove any blocking parts from the fan motor, clean out the dust, and ensure the fan motor sits firmly in position. If these fixes don’t work, likely, the fan motor is broken and you either have to replace it or get a new fan.\nThe F2 error is hard to troubleshoot since Dyson’s official guidelines are misleading.\nWith this F2 error fixing guide, I hope I could help you get rid of the F2 error in your Dyson fan!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fix-dyson-f2-error-code/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe F2 error code on Dyson fans is simple to fix once you know what causes it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, Dyson doesn’t seem to know what causes the error.

Based on the time passed since you last replaced the filter (or since you bought the air purifier), and the filter’s airflow resistance, Dyson can determine when a filter replacement is due.\nUnfortunately, the “F” code does not clear by itself and waits to be manually reset.\nIn this quick guide, I’ll shed some light on how to reset the “F” code on your Dyson air purifier.\nTo sum it up, here’s a quick outline of what we will cover:\nHow to Reset the “F” Code: You’ll first learn how to reset the F code according to Dyson. That is, buy a new filter, replace it, and reset the code using the remote. How to Reset the “F” Code without Replacing Filters: We’ll also cover how to clear the F without an expensive filter replacement. Workarounds when the Reset Doesn’t Work: And, of course, we’ll also look at some workarounds, for example, what to do if you don’t have your remote anymore (which is required for a reset according to the manual), and what to do when the fan turns off when you try to reset it. How to Remove the F Code (According to Dyson) Let’s first have a look at how to properly clear the F code on a Dyson air purifier.\n1. Replace the Filter The “F” code signals a due filter replacement. Before clearing the “F” code, you should, therefore, replace the filter first.\nDyson recommends buying original Dyson replacement filters. These are, however, comparably expensive.\nTo save money, you can also buy unbranded replacement filters for your particular model online.\nJust search for your Dyson model + “replacement filter” and look for a reasonably priced filter.\nOnly pick HEPA filters. Other filters are not capable of purifying the air to the same degree.\nFor filter replacement, unmount the bottom part of your Dyson fan, take out the old filter, and insert the new filter.\nRefer to a YouTube video or your Dyson manual for filter replacement instructions.\n2. Reset the F Code Once the air filter is replaced, you need to signal your Dyson air purifier to remove the F code.\nTo do that, press and hold the power button on your Dyson remote control.\nThe small screen on your Dyson air purifier should after a few seconds show a countdown animation.\nWait for the countdown to finish. After that, the regular display content should show again. In most cases, it’s a number for the air speed setting (e.g. “01” or “05”).\nHow to Clear the F Code Without Filter Replacement If the “F” code keeps showing or you prefer to not replace filters as often as Dyson recommends, of course, you can also clear the F code without a filter replacement.\nObviously, Dyson wants to sell you as many filters as possible. So, it’s in their best interest to show you the “F” as much as possible.\nOf course, occasional filter replacements are necessary. Air purifier filters degrade significantly after 6-12 months and pick up fewer and fewer particles from the air the more they age.\nBut you know better!\nThere are two reasons to ignore the F code and reset it without replacing filters:\nyou don’t care about air purification and want to use your Dyson as a fan only you prefer to replace filters on your own schedule In these cases, it’s absolutely valid to ignore Dyson’s filter replacement recommendation and reset the F code regardless.\nTo reset it, press and hold the power-off button on your remote control and wait for the F code and the countdown animation to disappear.\nWhat to do if the “F” Code Reset doesn’t work? The F code reset doesn’t always work as planned. Here are some additional troubleshooting steps.\nWhat to do if the “F” comes back? The “F” code tends to return when you reset your Dyson air purifier without actually replacing filters.\nYour Dyson fan notices the increased airflow resistance and displays the “F” again in this case.\nTo fix it take out your old filter and replace it (recommended), or remove the dust manually.\nReplace or Clean the Filter I recommend doing the filter replacement since it ensures that the air purification works.\nIf you want to use your Dyson air purifier as a fan only, you can also remove the layers of dust from the old filter manually.\nTo do this, pull off the thicker layers of dust with your bare hands. After that, use a compressed air gun, a vacuum, or a hairdryer to remove finer dust particles.\nAfter that, reinsert the filter and reset the F code as described earlier.\nRun the Fan Without a Filter You can also run your Dyson fan without the air filter if you don’t need the air purification. But attention: This voids the warranty.\nHowever, over time, dust will accumulate inside your Dyson fan over time (instead of on the air filter). In 1 or 2 years, you’ll have to open and dust your Dyson fan.\nWhat to do when the fan turns off when you hold the power button? Some Dyson models, especially the Dyson Hot+Cool models HP01 and HP02 (but possibly others as well), are known to shut off when you reset the “F” code by holding the power button on the remote.\nThis is a known issue and Dyson customer support does not provide an easy solution for this.\nIt’s either an issue with the software or the electronics of your particular unit.\nThe issue effectively prevents the “F” code reset.\nIf your Dyson fan is still within warranty, I recommend contacting Dyson customer support (or the shop you bought it from) to request a replacement.\nIf your Dyson fan is not under warranty anymore, you can:\nTry to reset the “F” code without the remote. That is described in the next section. Try running it without the filter and see if that does anything. Sell your Dyson air purifier as defective online and buy a new unit. Some people like to fix and flip defective Dyson fans. This way, you can get some of your money back. I recommend getting the Dyson TP07 air purifier (click here to view it on amazon).\nWhat to do when you don’t have the remote to reset your Dyson fan? For the reset according to Dyson user manuals, you need a remote control.\nIn many cases, however, you can reset the “F” code without a remote by pressing and holding the power button on the device for 6 seconds.\nIf that doesn’t work, I recommend getting a replacement remote control for Dyson fans.\nI recommend the following replacement remote controls:\nHP00 / HP01 remote control HP02 / HP02 remote control AM09 remote control AM06 / AM07 / AM08 remote control With the replacement remote, you should be able to reset the “F” code by holding the power button and waiting for the countdown animation to disappear.\nOftentimes replacement remotes don\u0026rsquo;t look as nice as the original Dyson remotes. But they get the job done and are cheaper than originals.\nConclusion Resetting the “F” code on a Dyson fan and air purifier is as simple as replacing the filter and holding the power button for a few seconds.\nSometimes, however, clearing the “F” code doesn’t work as intended. For example, the “F” comes back, the fan shuts off completely when you hold the remote control’s power button, or you have no remote control to reset it.\nIn these cases, you need workarounds. With the workarounds in this guide, you should be able to get clear of the “F” code, even without a remote.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-reset-the-f-code-on-a-dyson-air-purifier/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eEvery few months, your Dyson air purifier will show an F code with three blinking lights next to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe “F” code stands for “Filter” and signals you to replace your air purifier’s filter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDyson recommends to do this every 6-12 months.

Worst of all, it stopped heating altogether and you can’t get it to run anymore?\nDon’t worry. The E1 error is usually simple to fix.\nHi, my name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer, and in the past, I repaired electronics professionally.\nLet’s have a look at the issue together.\nWhy your Electric Heater shows an “E1” Error Code What does “E1” Mean? E1, standing for \u0026ldquo;Error 1\u0026rdquo;, often indicates an issue with the thermal cutoff switch or the thermostat in many electric heaters.\nAs an error code, “E1” is very popular. It stands for “Error 1”. So, it is the first error code programmed into your electric heater.\nImagine you are an engineer and your task is to program error codes. Most of the time, you start with E1.\nUnfortunately, E1 can technically mean anything, depending on the heater brand and model. But we can narrow down the cause of the E1 error code significantly, just by thinking about it:\nThe issue is not related to the power supply: If it was a power supply issue, likely the display would not turn on at all. Your heater senses the issue: If your heater couldn’t sense the issue, it wouldn’t display it. There is a high chance that the E1 error code is related to a sensor inside your heater (thermostat or a safety switch). With these two assumptions, we can make a good educated guess:\nWhat causes the E1 Error? Overheating: Heaters have built-in safety features that will shut them off when they get too hot. An E1 error can be the heater\u0026rsquo;s way of telling you this safety feature has been triggered.\nYour heater senses the overheating through a temperature sensor inside the its case. We’ll have a look at that later. Loose Wires: Connections inside the heater can sometimes become loose, especially if the heater has been moved around a lot.\nFor example, this could be a disconnected wire connecting the temperature sensor to the built-in thermostat. Faulty Components: Over time, parts inside the heater can wear out or become defective. Of those three causes, the overheating is the most likely. In most heaters, especially those with built-in fans, dust accumulates over time.\nAt some point, the dust inside the heater blocks airflow and causes overheating.\nBut it might just as well be another issue.\nIs the E1 Error Worth Fixing? If you have basic electronics knowledge, you should be able to fix the E1 error yourself.\nIf you, however, lack the skills or the tools to open up and inspect your heater, I recommend saving yourself the trouble and potential danger of doing so.\nOf course, it depends on which device of yours shows the E1 error. If it\u0026rsquo;s a simple space heater, I recommend just getting a new heater, at least until the E1 error is fixed:\nMy favorite infrared heater is the Dr. Infrared Heater DR-998 (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt can reliably heat even large living rooms during the winter. So, it\u0026rsquo;s a great backup heater to have anyways!\nThe Dr. Infrared DR-998 is a great heater that you can rely on when your main heater fails!\nIf the heater that shows the E1 error is a larger system such as a domestic heater or a water boiler, I recommend trying to check the issue yourself first. Quite possibly, it\u0026rsquo;s simpler to solve than you think with the troubleshooting steps below.\nIf that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work (don\u0026rsquo;t spend too much time if you hate fixing stuff), then hire an electrician.\nHow to Fix the E1 Error Code in Your Electric Heater Let’s have a look at how to fix the E1 error code in most electric heaters.\n1. Open up your Heater In any case, you need to have a look at the internal circuitry of your electric heater.\nTo do that, unplug your heater from its power supply first.\nThen, open up the back panel of your heater. Usually, you need a screwdriver or a hex key to do that.\nDisassemble your heater until you can easily reach inside. You need to be able to see everything clearly.\nAlso, get a lamp for better lighting.\n2. Clean out Dust to Prevent Overheating Now, there are two scenarios:\nEither your heater is perfectly clean inside, or you see thick layers of dust covering the heating element and the built-in fan.\nIf you can’t locate the heating element, remove the fan from its base. Usually, the heating element is right below the fan.\nIf your heater is clean inside, check whether it has a built-in air filter that collects all the dust. If there is an air filter, clean it (check the next section).\nIn case your heater is dust-free and there’s no air filter, the E1 error code is unlikely to come from an actual overheating.\n( It might still come from “virtual” overheating, triggered by wrong sensor readings - we’ll have a look at that as well )\nBut if your heater is clogged with dust, remove all the dust from its inside.\nTo do that, you can first pull off the thickest layers of dust with your bare hands. Then, use a dry brush (or an old toothbrush) or compressed air to get rid of the finer dust layers.\nOnce your heater is dust-free, turn it on and see if the E1 error shows. Likely, it is gone.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what a clogged space heater looks like. As you can see, the heating element is fully covered under a thick layer of dust.\nIf your heater still shows the E1, continue with the next troubleshooting steps.\n3. Clean or Replace Filters to Allow Free Airflow Some electric heaters have built-in air filters. These accumulate dust over time until the filter is clogged and blocks airflow.\nPlease note that only a few electric heaters have built-in air filters. If your heater doesn’t have any, just skip this step.\nThe lack of airflow then causes your heater to overheat.\nTo fix this, take out the air filter of your electric heater, remove the dust, and put it back in place.\nAlternatively, replace the filters.\nCheck if the E1 error persists.\n4. Check Temperature Sensors By now, your heater should be fully cleaned. If it’s still showing the E1 error, the thermostat’s temperature sensor could be faulty.\nHere’s a quick check:\nTurn on your electric heater. You should see the E1 error now. Is it possible to view a current room temperature reading regardless?\nIf yes, check the displayed temperature. Does it make sense or is it off?\nIf the temperature reading is off, your thermostat’s temperature sensor is faulty.\nIn many heaters, you can’t test this as easily, unfortunately, because either they don’t have a “current room temperature” display, or the E1 error hides the desired display.\nIn this case, check the temperature sensor manually. Open up the heater\u0026rsquo;s back side. Locate the temperature sensor. Usually, it’s a small metal piece attached to the inside of the heater’s case through lengthy, but thin wires.\nHere’s an image for reference:\nA thermostat temperature sensor. In smaller heaters such as electric space heaters, they might have smaller sensor heads. But in general, it\u0026rsquo;s a metal head piece connected via wire to the rest of the heater.\nEnsure the sensor wires are properly connected at both ends.\nIf you can, using a multimeter, measure the voltage across the two wires with varying temperatures. You can use a lighter to heat up the metal sensor. The voltage should be higher than when the sensor is cool.\nIf the voltage changes, also confirm that the changing voltage arrives at your heater\u0026rsquo;s thermostat circuitry. If it does, the sensor is working and does not cause the E1 error code.\nElse, if the voltage vanishes somewhere, there might be an open or short circuit somewhere.\nIf if the voltage doesn’t change, the temperature sensor is broken and needs replacement.\n6. Replace the Thermal Cutoff Switch Most electric heaters have a built-in thermal cutoff switch that signals to shut off the heater. The thermal cutoff switch resembles the overheat protection.\nThe thermal cutoff switch looks similar to a thermostat. It’s usually a metal or ceramic headpiece mounted somewhere inside your heater.\nThe thermal cutoff switch closes the electric heating circuit when the heater’s temperature is below the overheating cutoff temperature.\nWhen the temperature surpasses the cutoff temperature, it opens the circuit and cuts off the power supply.\nSo, it’s a simple switch. And you can test it with a multimeter with a simple continuity test.\nLocate the thermal cutoff switch inside your electric heater and check that the circuit is closed (when the heater is cool).\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s not, replace it.\nA trick:\nIf your heater keeps cutting off and signaling E1 with that switch, even though it appears to be working correctly, you can replace it with a cutoff switch with a higher cutoff temperature rating.\nBut please only do this if you know what you’re doing and you are sure your heater is otherwise operating correctly.\nDon’t do this with electric water boilers, since higher cutoff temperature can lead to dangerous pressure buildup!\n5. Connect Loose Wires Next, look for any wires that might have become disconnected from any component on the heater’s circuitry.\nIf you find any loose connections, reconnect them. If the connection point broke, you might have to replace the entire wire or even the connector.\nThe wires and connectors inside heaters are usually simple to replace. You can find replacement parts in any electronic hardware store or online.\nFor the replacement, you need a soldering iron.\nIf you can’t replace a torn-off wire yourself, hire someone or ask a knowledgeable friend or family member to do it for you.\nMake sure you check that connectors like these are connected firmly!\n7. Inspect Other Components:\nIf after cleaning out the dust, and checking all sensors and wires, the E1 error still persists, the issue is likely an electronic or a software issue that’s harder to locate.\nWorking in an electronics repair department I learned one thing: You can spot 90% of electric issues visually. You don’t need multimeter troubleshooting skills.\nOf course, if you know what to do, go ahead.\nHere’s what I’d do:\nSet up a bright lamp and get a magnifying glass. Set a 5-minute timer.\nDuring the 5 minutes, just stare at the electric circuitry. Look out for\nblown parts parts with burn marks around them disconnected or hovering parts (parts not connecting to their dedicated solder joint) missing parts (be careful: sometimes, there are intentional blank spots on circuit boards where one could solder a component onto - but when a part is missing it is usually evident) Usually, you will quickly find the cause of the issue.\nOnce detected, identify the affected part and buy a matching replacement.\nFor identification of burnt parts (where you can’t read the labels anymore), you can look for a matching part nearby. Oftentimes, there are multiple parts of the same sort on the same circuit board.\n7. Reset the Heater So far, you checked all the possible causes of the issue. If the issue still persists, even after checking and solving all the potential causes described earlier, it could be that the E1 error code is stuck and waiting to be reset manually.\nSome electric heaters don’t reset error codes on their own and keep showing the E1 error until you flag the issue as solved.\nTo reset the E1 error, oftentimes power cycling your electric heater should be sufficient. That is, turn on and off your heater 5-10 times.\nAlso, look for a reset button on the bottom of the heater. Or a small poke-through hole with an embedded reset button (similar to many old electronic devices) you can only push with a needle.\nIf that doesn’t do it, check your electric heater’s manual for a reset procedure and follow it.\nExperts Only: Temporary Workarounds to Run Your Heater Despite the E1 Error There are a few hacks to get rid of the E1 error code. These are not safe and you should not use them around your family, since they decrease your heater’s safety.\nOnly use them with smaller portable electric heaters and avoid using them in large domestic heating systems.\nKnowledge is power, but it can be dangerous as well.\nFor the following hacks, I assume you know your heater very well.\nEspecially when you work with a larger-scale electric heater such as a water boiler (as in the image above), you have to know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. Otherwise, hire a technician. There\u0026rsquo;s just too much that can go wrong.\nQuite recently, I almost blew up my water boiler because I tried to fix something myself that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t very familiar with. It ended up in a pressure buildup and a blown pipe.\nRemove the Overheat Protection If the E1 error comes from your heater’s overheat protection triggering too early you can remove the overheat protection mechanism.\nFor example, if it’s a thermal cutoff switch, replace it with a continuous wire.\nCheck the overheat protection mechanism of your heater and remove it properly.\nRemoving the overheat protection is only safe if you dust-clean your heater every 3-6 months and you run it at moderate temperatures.\nRemove the Thermostat’s Temperature Sensor Similarly, you can remove the thermostat’s temperature sensor. Depending on how the thermostat is implemented, your heater stops working completely without the temperature sensor, or it heats a lot more.\nThe absence of a temperature sensor can either signal to the thermostat that your room is very cold (in which case the heater will continue heating), or very hot (in which case the heater will stop).\nSee if that gets rid of the E1 error code.\nGenerally, removing the thermostat’s temperature sensor might remove the E1 error code and get the heater working again. But it’s only an emergency solution for a heating outage in the freezing winter. Replace the sensor with a working one as soon as possible.\nHarvest parts from a defective heater Thirdly, you can buy a defective matching heater on a marketplace website such as eBay or Craigslist.\nThen, disassemble the defective heater and use it for replacement parts.\nThis way you can replace individual components of your heater showing the E1 error and see whether the E1 error disappears.\nI recommend doing individual replacements, for example:\nTry replacing the overheat protection only. If that doesn’t solve the problem, reinstall the original overheat protection. Then, replace another part. If it doesn’t solve E1, reinstall the original part again.\nThis way, you ensure that you don’t install a defective part from the defective heater and you end up with two broken devices.\nThis hack takes a lot of time, work, and knowledge. So, I recommend this only if you enjoy fixing this and the heater repair is not urgent.\nConclusion Fixing the E1 error on an electric space heater can be straightforward, especially with some knowledge and the right tools.\nUsually, the source of the E1 error code is overheating due to dust accumulation, a faulty temperature sensor, or a faulty thermal cutoff switch.\nAll of these issues are fixable.\nIf, after fixing the source of the issue, the E1 error persists, try to reset your heater.\nRemember to always prioritize safety when working with electrical devices.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve addressed the error, your heater should be back to keeping your space warm and cozy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-electric-heater-e1-error/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour electric heater displays an E1 error code and you don’t know what to do?

All the more surprising it is when your Lasko heater suddenly shuts off on its own. And after turning it back on, it doesn’t take long until it shuts off again.\nWhat is happening here?\nLuckily, the issue is, in most cases, very simple to fix.\nWhy Lasko Ceramic Heaters Shut Off On Their Own Last ceramic heaters shut off on their own when they overheat.\nOverheat protection is a safety mechanism that prevents fires when your Lasko heater gets too hot internally.\nAlthough there can be other reasons for your Lasko heater shutting off as well, the overheat protection is the most common case.\nIf it’s not a triggered overheat protection, then likely it is a loose contact in the electronics or a similar electronic issue.\nHow to Fix Your Lasko Ceramic Heater That Keeps Shutting Off Because it’s by far the most common cause for a Lasko heater to keep shutting off we’ll focus on fixing the overheating first.\nAnd only if that doesn’t work, I’ll tell you where else to look.\nBut in 9 out of 10 cases, the issue is the overheat protection.\nHere’s what you need to do:\n1. Remove Dust to Prevent Overheating Over time, your Lasko heater accumulates dust. The dust inside the heater prevents air circulation, which prevents your heater from blowing out the hot air.\nAdditionally, the dust covers the ceramic heating element and insulates it, which causes it to get way too hot.\nIn most cases, the overheating that causes the shut-offs is due to dust buildup inside your Lasko heater.\nTo fix the overheating, you need to remove the dust inside your Lasko heater.\nDisassemble your Lasko Ceramic Heater First, you have to open up the back side of your Lasko heater.\nMake sure your heater is unplugged!\nThis differs for every Lasko model, but usually, there are simple screws on the back that you can unscrew with a screwdriver or an Allen key.\nTake off the back panel of your heater.\nIn most models, you’ll find a temperature sensor attached to the back casing.\nYou should now see a squirrel cage fan, with its motor.\nThe ceramic heating element usually sits below the blower motor. So, unscrew the blower motor from its base to uncover the heating elements.\nYou should see a thick layer of dust now.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what a clogged Lasko heater looks like internally. A thick layer of dust covers the heating element which sits below the blower motor. ( source)\nClean the Heating Element Now, remove all the dust from the heating element. Oftentimes the dust is dense enough, that you can pull it off with your bare hands.\nThe cleaner you get your heating element, the longer it takes for dust to build up again. So, it makes sense to do this thoroughly. Dust attracts more dust.\nIdeally, you use compressed air to blow out the dust. Or you can use a vacuum. But make sure not to damage the heating coil.\nIn one video, I saw someone clean his heating element with a wire brush … I doubt this is a good idea.\nI recommend compressed air cans or this electric compressed air duster.\nClean the Squirrel Cage This may vary between Lasko models, but usually, they have a squirrel cage blower. You can take off the squirrel cage from the blower motor.\nIn my case, it’s a dual-mount, with one squirrel cage sitting below, and one above the blower motor.\nThen, you can rinse the squirrel cage (or squirrel cages) with water.\nDry them off thoroughly. Humidity and dust do not combine well. You’ll never get rid of the smell otherwise.\nWhen they are dry, mount them back onto the motor axes.\nIf you can’t take off your squirrel cage, your fan blade (or whatever blower mechanism there is inside your Lasko heater), just dust it off while it’s mounted. The rinsing is not needed. I just recommend it for a thorough cleaning.\nDon’t use any chemical cleaners for any of the cleaning steps. These only harm the electronics, and, when you turn your heater on the chemical residue can turn into unhealthy gases.\nOnce it\u0026rsquo;s cleaned, your Lasko heater should be as dust-free as the heater in the image above.\nReassemble your Lasko Ceramic Heater Once the internal components of your Lasko are dust-free, reassemble it.\nMount the blower back onto its base. Then, mount the back cover back onto the rest of your Lasko heater.\nTest whether the Heater Shuts Off Turn on the heater using the power button. Set a high temperature.\nYou should immediately notice better airflow.\nAlso, your heater should not shut off on its own.\nThe problem is solved!\n2. Check your Heater for Electronic Issues If removing the dust inside your heater doesn’t help, you’ll need to re-inspect what’s going on.\nSo, disassemble your Lasko heater again.\nMake sure, you did not miss dust any hidden dust-buildup spot initially. There might still be an overheating due to dust, you just don’t see it.\nThat’s why I recommended compressed air earlier. It blows out from cracks you don’t even notice.\nOnce you’re sure your heater is dust-free, check it for electronic issues.\nVisually Inspect the Circuitry I worked in the electronics repair department of an electronics manufacturer once. And almost all issues that are fixable are visible with your bare eyes.\nMany people think they need to know how to voltage probe parts to be able to troubleshoot electronics. In most cases, they don’t.\nHere’s my advice:\nSet a 5-minute timer and stare at the electronic circuitry for 5 minutes. Just look at it. Use a bright light to help you see better.\nLook out for:\nDisconnected / open / loosely connected connectors Burn marks Blown parts If there is an electronic issue that causes your Lasko heater to keep shutting off, you will see it.\nFix the Electronic Problem Once the problem is spotted, fix it. Firmly connect any loose or open connections.\nAnd replace blown or burnt parts.\nYou should be able to find a matching replacement part in an electronic online store.\nIf you can’t find it, try to get a matching replacement circuit board, or harvest it from an old defective Lasko heater.\nIf you know electronics well, you can also solder in a different part from another old device, ideally with a similar specification, and see if that works.\nYour Lasko heater should not shut off on its own anymore.\n3. Check the Thermostat Setting If your Lasko heater is dust-free and there is no visible electronic problem, please have another look at your Lasko heater’s thermostat setting.\nThe thermostat controls the temperature. On the front panel of your Lasko heater, you set the target temperature of your heater. The target temperature reflects your desired room temperature.\nYour Lasko heater outputs hot air until the target temperature is reached.\nIf you set a target temperature that is close to the current room temperature, the thermostat will shut off the heating quickly.\nSo, make sure you set the highest possible temperature for this troubleshooting!\nIf you set a too-low temperature that’s what’s causing your Lasko heater to shut off on it’s own.\nBut to be precise, in this case, it should also turn on on its own again once the room temperature drops below by certain threshold below the target temperature.\nWhat to do if you can’t fix your Lasko heater? Oftentimes, Lasko heaters that keep shutting off are simple to fix. But sometimes, the cause of the issue is not evident at all.\nAnd sometimes, you just don’t have the time, the skills, and the tools to repair your Lasko heater on your own.\nIn this case, I highly recommend saving yourself all the trouble. Instead of spending hours troubleshooting the self-shutoff issue, you might as well buy a new heater.\nA new heater costs you money, yes. But it saves you potential headaches and a ruined day wasted on fruitless troubleshooting.\nSpace heaters are not expensive. Oftentimes, just buying a new heater is the best way forward.\nThe automatic shut-off problem does not occur in all space heaters. Usually, the issue is in ceramic heaters with a built-in blower.\nRecommended heater that never shuts off on its own If you want to avoid self-shut-offs in the future, I recommend getting an oil-filled radiator.\nMy favorite oil-filled radiator is cheap, reliable, and never had a single electronic issue.\nOil-filled radiators work without blower fans, and no moving parts at all. So, they don’t break down over time.\nThey are maintenance-free for decades!\nConclusion These 3 fixes should cover most Lasko heaters shutting off on their own.\nIf none of the fixes above did it for you (which is unlikely), have a look at this article:\nSpace Heater keeps shutting off (5 reasons and how to fix it)\nIt covers additional potential causes, such as a triggered tip-over protection, power problems in your home’s electric circuitry, and wall outlet problems.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/lasko-heater-keeps-shutting-off/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLasko ceramic heaters are very reliable.

For Dyson Humidifiers: On the Dyson Pure+Humidify models, the F3 error code means the device is too cold (under 5°C / 41°F).\nIn many cases, however, the F3 error appears at room temperature.\nAnd, unfortunately, Dyson themselves don’t provide any further information on what the F3 error is.\nFor Dyson Pure+Cool fans: The F3 error shows when your Dyson Pure+Cool fan is turned on and stops it from blowing air.\nOftentimes, people report the F3 error code right before or after filter replacement.\nThe F3 error code is not an issue with the fan, the filter, or a power issue. It can occur in Dyson Pure+Cool fans that are well-maintained.\nThe gist of it is:\nNobody knows exactly what causes the F3 error code on Dyson Pure+Cool models.\nHow to Reset the F3 Error Code There are two ways to reset the F3 error code, one with the remote, and one without it.\nBasic Reset: Press and hold the power button on the fan for about 10 seconds, or; Unplug the unit from the electrical outlet for around 15 seconds. If the F3 error persists, retry until it’s gone. Remote Reset: Hold down the power button and the volume up button on the remote control at the same time for approximately 30 seconds. Try both reset methods. Oftentimes, the basic reset doesn’t work, while the remote reset solves the issue!\nThese reset actions can potentially get the fan working again temporarily.\nHowever, the real bummer is, they don’t address the root cause of the issue, which means the error might reoccur.\nUnfortunately, the time at which the error appears again seems to be totally random. It might come back in a few minutes, or only in a few months.\nHow to Reduce the Risk of the F3 Error Code Returning? Possibly, the F3 error code was initially triggered by some internal issue in your Dyson fan. That could be a slight overheating, a slight surge in power, or internal friction increasing due to dust accumulation.\nIn any case: We don’t know exactly what causes the F3 error.\nBut you should still eliminate basic causes:\nInsert a new filter: Insert a new filter in your Dyson fan. If you already did that, there’s no reason to do it again. We just want to eliminate an old filter as a possible cause. Blow out dust: Disassemble your Dyson fan and blow out all the dust with a compressed air gun. Compressed air guns are critical for proper maintenance of a Dyson fan since they are the only way to get rid of all the dust and internal cloggings, without damaging sensitive electronics.\nI recommend this compressed air gun (click here to view it on amazon). Clean the fan blades: Usually, you can take the top part (the large circular fan) off your Dyson fan. It doesn’t contain any electronics.\nFor the top part disassembly, I found this video helpful.\nSo, you can blow strong compressed air through it to remove all the dust and any clogging.\nYou can even soak the entire top portion of a Dyson fan in water. Give it a thorough rinse. A clean Dyson fan with a new filter should have a reduced risk of getting new F3 errors. The F3 error can still return, but at least you rule out basic issues that stem from a lack of maintenance.\nSee how much dust accumulates inside a Dyson fan! This could be a cause of electronic issues. Disassemble your Dyson fan and clean it out.\nWhat to do about the F3 Error Code long term? Nobody knows why the F3 error occurs. We only know that you can reset the F3 error code as explained earlier, and that it will return after some time.\nOn some devices, it returns within a couple of minutes, while for others, the F3 will show only after a few months.\nSo, here’s my suggestion for the future:\nReset your Dyson Pure+Cool (or Humidify) model and find out how long it takes until the F3 code shows again.\nReset again.\nWatch the time again.\nIf the F3 error persists and comes back multiple times within a day, I recommend getting a new fan or humidifier.\nAnd:\nIt does not have to be a Dyson model! See here: Are Dyson Cooling Fans Worth It?\nRecommended Non-Dyson Air Purifier For the future, I’d advise you to not buy a Dyson fan. Not because they are particularly bad. But if one brand doesn’t work for you, you should not reward them by buying another model. If that new model ever shows the same error, you’ll be resentful.\nOne brand I find very reliable is Coway, which is one of Dyson’s best competitors.\nIn particular, I recommend a Coway Airmega air purifier.\nClick here to view the Coway Airmega 400 on Amazon.\nIt’s a flagship air purifier that comes with auto mode, air quality monitoring, and air filters with multiple filtration layers, just like a Dyson air purifier.\nHave a look at it and see if that’s something for you. If you’re looking for air purification only, I’d recommend a Coway over a Dyson anytime.\nConclusion To reset the F3 error code, hold the power button on your Dyson fan for 10 seconds. Turn your Dyson fan back on. If the issue persists, repeat. With this power-cycling approach, the issue goes away after some tries in most cases.\nI hope with this article, you were at least able to reset your F3 filter. The issue is an absolute riddle, since the solution seems to differ for many people.\nSo, I decided to open a comment section below this article! Please write about your situation, and how you managed to handle the F3 error.\nThis way we can build a knowledge base for this strange error code.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/dyson-f3-error-code-fix/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOwning a Dyson Pure+Cool or a Humidify+Cool fan has its fair share of perks, from enjoying a cool breeze to breathing cleaner air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when the F3 error code comes up, your Dyson Fan suddenly stops despite all seeming well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;ve been scratching your head over this, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone: Nobody really knows what causes the F3 error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, I’ll tell you how to fix the F3 error code, or at least,  how to reset it.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Dyson F3 Error Code: How to Fix It"},{"content":"During the chilly months, a reliable portable heater like Mr. Heater can be a true lifesaver, radiating warmth and making indoor spaces comfortable and cozy.\nHowever, like all appliances, Mr. Heater units have components that may wear over time, and one such crucial component is the ceramic burner tile.\nThe burner tile is prone to cracking due to the constant heating and cooling cycles it undergoes.\nA cracked burner tile can lead to inefficient heating and even pose safety risks.\nTherefore, replacing a cracked burner tile is essential to ensure the efficient and safe operation of your Mr. Heater unit\nThe good news is, with some basic tools and a little patience, you can undertake this task at home without the need for professional help.\nIn this guide, we’ll walk you through a step-by-step process on how to replace the ceramic burner tile in various Mr. Heater models.\nWhether you own a Mr. Heater Buddy, Little Buddy, Hunting Buddy, or Big Buddy, this guide will provide you with a clear pathway to restoring your heater to its prime condition, ensuring many more warm and comfortable days ahead.\nQuick answer: To replace your Mr. Heater Burner tile, you’ll need to buy a replacement burner tile kit for your Mr. Heater model.

All the more annoying it is when your air purifier keeps shutting off on its own.\nIn this article, we’ll have a look at 7 common reasons and how to fix them.\nLuckily, the troubleshooting is not difficult and for most fixes, you don’t need any electronics knowledge.\nSo, this is a layman’s guide to fixing an air purifier that keeps shutting off!\nQuick answer: Usually, air purifiers keep shutting off due to mechanical issues such as clogged filters or overheating. Make sure the filters are clean and the fan is lubricated. Also, some people forget about “Auto” mode, where the air purifier automatically turns off when the air is clean. And lastly, there could be electronic or software issues. In this case, it’s best to buy a new air purifier.\nShould you Fix or Replace your Air Purifier that Keeps Shutting Off? Air purifiers are low-power devices. So, repairing an air purifier, as long as its not connected to the wall outlet is not dangerous.\nThere’s next to nothing you can do wrong.\nIn general, I recommend fixing your air purifier, EXCEPT:\nIf you don’t have the tools If you don’t have the skills If you don’t care about electronics If fixing stuff makes you unhappy Repairs are not for everybody. So, oftentimes, the best solution is to just buy a new air purifier without having to worry about fixing it.\nHere’s my advice:\nIf you lack the confidence to fix your air purifier, I highly recommend getting a new air purifier.\nMy favorite air purifier is the Levoit Core 300S. Click the link to read my review.\nOr check it out on Amazon directly:\nL evoit Core 300S (click to see it on amazon) It’s a very simple air purifier. And the chance that it ever stops working is very low. I haven’t had a single problem with mine.\nHow to fix your Air Purifier that Keeps Shutting Off Oftentimes, the fix for an air purifier not working can be very simple. Possibly, your air purifier will be up and running again in just 15 minutes.\nSo, let’s troubleshoot:\n1. Auto / Smart Mode Active Many air purifiers, especially larger \u0026amp; pricier class models from Levoit, Coway, BlueAir, Dyson, etc. come with built-in air quality monitoring and an automatic mode, usually called “Auto Mode” or “Smart Mode”.\nWhen Auto mode is active, your air purifier monitors the air quality in your room and turns the fan on and off accordingly.\nThe idea is to only activate the fan when the air in your room is polluted.\nIf your air purifier has an automatic mode, it might be shutting off because the air is already clean. Verify if this setting is activated and consider switching to manual mode if you prefer continuous operation.\nIt’s very easy to accidentally turn on auto mode.\nSet your air purifier to \u0026ldquo;Manual\u0026rdquo; mode and see if it works!\nTry to run your air purifier in \u0026ldquo;Manual\u0026rdquo; mode and see if it keeps shutting off!\n2. Overheating Even though air purifiers consume very little power, they can still overheat, which leads to a shutdown.\nThis shutdown might occur due to a built-in safety mechanism designed to prevent damage or fire hazards, or simply because the internal components cease to function properly when overheated. Although new air purifiers are less likely to experience this issue, it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely out of the question.\nHere are two possible reasons for the overheating:\nAged or Worn Parts: Particularly in older units \u0026amp; especially in humid climates, internal parts are often worn out, which increases friction and heat.\nOpen your air purifier and check that the fan rotates freely. Add lubricant to the fan’s rotational axis. You can use a simple fine mechanics lubricant.\nIf the fan is stuck or it rotates only with great effort, it’s time for a new air purifier! Direct Sunlight Exposure: Direct sunlight can overheat your air purifier. Place your air purifier in a cool spot and try again. Always make sure your air purifier is not exposed to weather, i.e. humidity and sunlight. As long as your air purifier stands in a shady corner of your room, your air purifier shutting off due to overheating is very unlikely.\n3. Dirty or Clogged Filters / Air Inlet Holes Over time, filters in air purifiers get clogged with dirt and other airborne particles. The dust and dirt buildup on the filters greatly increases airflow resistance, which, in turn, increases the power your air purifier consumes.\nWhen your air purifier airways are overly clogged and don’t let any air pass, your air purifier might turn off on its own.\nTo fix the issue, replace your air purifier’s filter and clean the air inlet holes. These are the holes around the air purifier casing.\nOftentimes, these can clog up too, especially in greasy places, such as in a kitchen.\nIdeally, to clean greasy air inlet holes, use Q-tips and rubbing alcohol.\nAlso, replace your air purifier filters every 6-12 months.\nClean the air inlet holes around the unit\u0026rsquo;s casing.\n4. Electrical Issues Loose connections, faulty outlets, or issues with the purifier\u0026rsquo;s cord could cause intermittent power supply to the unit resulting in the air purifier shutting off unexpectedly.\nFirst of all, try running your air purifier on another wall outlet, ideally in another room. If it works there, likely your wall outlet is defective.\nIf that doesn’t help, wiggle the power cord around while your air purifier is turned on. Does it shut off when you wiggle the cord vs. when you don’t? In this case, the cord has a loose contact.\nElse, the issue may be in the air purifier’s internal electronic circuitry. It could be something obvious such as a disconnected connector, or a blown capacitor.\nIn any case, it makes sense to disassemble the air purifier and spend a few minutes looking for obvious visual issues.\nFor full electric troubleshooting, have a look at this post: How to fix an Air Purifier not turning on\n5. Software Bug / Bad Connectivity Some advanced air purifiers run on software, for example, to connect to a smart home system such as Alexa, or to allow remote app controls.\nAnd like any other smart appliance, air purifiers can experience software bugs that could cause them to shut down unexpectedly.\nIf your air purifier is a smart device, I recommend the following:\nCheck for updates: Update any air purifier software including the remote control app. Reset the device: Check the user manual of your air purifier and reset your device accordingly. Try running your air purifier without Smart features: Test whether your air purifier works when you don’t control it via remote and when it’s not connected via Wi-Fi. 6. Sensor Malfunction Most higher-priced air purifiers have sensors to measure air quality. When your sensor is dirty, or when there’s an electrical fault, it can send false signals to your air purifier, causing it to shut off on its own.\nTo fix the issue, locate the air quality sensor of your air purifier and give it a thorough wipe.\nLikely, you need to disassemble your air purifier. But sometimes the sensor is accessible from the outside, sitting under an easy-to-open cover.\nLook out for a cover label containing the words “PM2.5” (that’s the particle size the sensor is detecting), “Laser” (that’s the technology the sensor uses), or “Sensor”.\nFor cleaning the sensor I recommend using a Q-tip with rubbing alcohol.\nIf that doesn’t solve the issue, likely the sensor is defective. You can work around the issue by running your air purifier without “Smart” or “Auto” mode active.\nThen, it does not use air quality sensor readings to determine whether to run or shut off.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a close-up picture of a Coway air purifier. There are three sensors to clean.\n7. Timer Settings Some air purifiers come with timer settings that allow users to set the device to operate for a specified duration.\nEnsure that the timer is not set inadvertently causing the air purifier to shut off.\nUsually, air purifiers allow you to set a timer at 1h, 4h, and 8h.\nBut some more customizable devices have timers with minute precision. Make sure your timer is not set to shut off after a few minutes!\nReview and adjust the timer settings as per your preference.\nQuick Troubleshooting Tip: Test your Air Purifier without the Filter These were the most common reasons why air purifiers keep shutting off on their own. If you can’t yet figure out what’s wrong with your air purifier, you should at least roughly eliminate the causes:\nOne simple test is to run your air purifier without the HEPA filter.\nIf your air purifier works without the filter but keeps shutting off when the filter is inserted, likely the filter is blocking airflow.\nThis could be due to dirt and dust buildup, or, even due to too high humidity as moisture settling on the filter can block airflow as well.\nIn this case, I recommend replacing the filter with a new one and see if your air purifier works with the new filter.\nConclusion By now, you should know whether to fix or replace your defective air purifier. If you don’t have the skills or the motivation to fix it, simply get a new air purifier.\nBut likely, fixing your air purifier takes just a couple of minutes.\nGive your air purifier a thorough clean, blow out all the dust, ensure the HEPA filter is new, and run it in manual mode!\nIf it still keeps shutting off, likely, the issue is in the electric circuitry.\nIn this case, you can proceed with electric troubleshooting. Admittedly, this requires knowledge and skill.\nSo, at this point, I also recommend replacing your air purifier with a new unit!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/fix-air-purifier-keeps-shutting-off/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAir purifiers are great for keeping the air in your living space fresh and clean.

Instead, they degrade slowly, leaving you in a grey area about when exactly to invest in a new unit.\nTo help the decision-making, rules like \u0026lsquo;replace it after 10 years\u0026rsquo; exist. But are they genuine?\nI found that most rules on the internet are constructed by the HVAC industry to sell you a new air conditioner way too early.\nIn this article, I’ll show you 3 rules of thumb you can trust that help you decide whether to replace your air conditioner or not!\nLet’s have a look:\nRule 1: Take HVAC Industry Advice with a Grain of Salt First of all, take any advice you read on HVAC websites with a grain of salt. Usually, they try to sell you a new air conditioning system you don’t need.\nYou’ll find all kinds of different advice online, ranging from the 10-year rule to repair cost-based rules.\nThe fundamental problem: Rules like the 10-year replacement rule are all arbitrary and made up by the HVAC industry.\nAir conditioners don’t suddenly become inefficient after 10 years. Also, their repair cost does not necessarily increase over the years.\nOne interesting rule put out by HVAC companies is the $5,000 rule. According to the $5,000 rule, you should replace your air conditioner if yearly maintenance \u0026amp; repair costs multiplied by the age of the air conditioner in years surpass $5,000.\nThe fundamental problem with this rule is that age is a factor. The older your air conditioner gets, the more pressing the replacement gets, according to the rule. No matter how little the maintenance cost and how well your unit works, at some point replacement will be necessary according to the rule.\nThat’s obviously not true.\nAlways keep in mind: Take HVAC industry advice with a grain of salt.\nRule 2: Never Replace a Working Unit There is no reason to replace a working air conditioner. No matter what the HVAC industry tells you, getting a new air conditioner is always going to be more expensive than running your old unit.\nOld unit maintenance \u0026amp; repairs are economical. Usually, old units require\nrefrigerant refills filter replacement \u0026amp; coil cleaning compressor or power supply fixing in case of errors These are all standard tasks for a technician. Their scope is limited and they can be done within a day. Basic maintenance doesn’t get more expensive over time.\nGetting a new air conditioner unit, however, requires:\nconsultation for the new system labor intense installation disposal of the old unit a large monetary investment ductwork evaluation potential electrical upgrades And the list continues. Expenses for a new air conditioner unit are not limited in scope. They can get arbitrarily large, depending on your home’s electric circuitry and ductwork. Getting a new air conditioner potentially blows up into a never-ending stream of tasks to be done.\nAnd that’s precisely why air conditioner replacement is so profitable for HVAC companies.\nAlways remember: Never replace a working unit.\nRule 3: Don’t Speculate, Wait Instead Our governments create new laws daily.\nIn 2020, for example, the US government prohibited the production and import of new R22 refrigerant. R22 refrigerant was predominantly used in old air conditioners. From 2010 onwards, new air conditioners are prohibited to run with R22.\nIf you still run an old R22-based air conditioner, don’t panic.\nIt is not prohibited to continue running your old air conditioner. It’s just illegal to recharge it with R22 refrigerant. And possibly the refrigerant in your air conditioner lasts another few years.\nThat’s plenty of time to save money.\nThe most cost-effective way to handle changes in laws, local rules, or technology is almost always to wait.\nLikely, your air conditioner lasts a lot longer than you expected. And possibly laws change while you wait. Keep your air conditioner as long as it’s working. Don’t jump at the news!\nAlways remember: Don’t speculate, wait instead.\nIs Air Conditioner Replacement worth it for better efficiency? It\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that while restoring comfort is a priority, efficiency shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be overlooked.\nSince 1987, federal standards for air conditioners have evolved, setting the bar at SEER 10, then raising it to SEER 13 in 2006.\nToday, for an air conditioner to meet ENERGY STAR® specifications, it must boast a SEER rating of 14.5 or higher and an EER of 12 or more.\nReplacing the entire system, or parts of it, offers an opportunity to not only restore comfort but also improve energy efficiency, potentially reducing cooling costs.\nBut how do you navigate this maze of considerations to make an informed choice?\nThat’s where many HVAC companies start creating unnecessarily complex rules.\nUsually, the answer is simple:\nThe running cost of an air conditioner is far too low to justify replacing a working unit.\nAir conditioners were already energy efficient 20 years ago. Even old air conditioners have rather low running costs.\nYour energy savings through replacing air conditioners will be somewhere between $25 - $50 per month, depending on where you live and your usage.\nWould that justify expenses up to $10,000?\nAlso, shift your thinking:\nYou can only make such a large purchase once every other decade. The more you delay air conditioner replacement, the better the new air conditioner will be due to energy efficiency improvements.\nA new air conditioner in 2-3 years is even more efficient than a new air conditioner now.\nIn most cases, running your old air conditioner as long as possible saves you the most money.\nCase study: Energy Savings after Replacement The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the following yearly energy savings for 15 SEER vs 13 SEER air conditioners in different climate zones:\n**Climate****Yearly Electricity Cost Savings (15 SEER vs 13 SEER)**Hot-Dry$82Hot-Humid$95Mixed-Humid$59Marine$11Cold$29\nNote that these are yearly savings. My conclusion:\nReplacing air conditioners for increased efficiency is not worth it.\nConclusion Replace your air conditioner only when it is absolutely necessary, e.g. when your air conditioner is irreparable, your electricity cost is way too high, or because of a change in law you can’t circumvent.\nAs long as your air conditioning unit works, keep it.\nMaintenance \u0026amp; repair cost is limited, while a new unit with installation can turn into a money pit.\nDon’t fall for HVAC companies \u0026amp; posts online spreading fear and uncertainty. Their job is to sell you a new air conditioner.\nUse your air conditioner while it’s still working. Even if it’s not the most efficient device.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/when-to-replace-air-conditioner/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Is it time to replace my air conditioner?\u0026rdquo; This is a question that plagues many homeowners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAir conditioners, unlike some other household items, don\u0026rsquo;t just stop working overnight.

I’ve been writing about Dyson heaters a lot, especially since they come with a large price tag.\nIn one post, I evaluated all their marketing, especially Dyson’s energy efficiency, the air multiplier technology, and their price tag.\nThe result:\nDyson heaters are very expensive, and the marketing really goes overboard.\nJudged by the technology alone, Dyson heaters are by far the best-engineered space heaters.\nThey come with so many built-in features, I hope I don’t miss anything:\nAir Purification: Dyson heaters always filter the air using a HEPA filter. No other space heater does that. Air Quality Monitoring: On top of that, Dyson heaters monitor air quality using a set of particle sensors. Again, that’s unique among space heaters. Design: Dyson heaters just look nice. Based on features alone, Dyson is easily the best brand for space heaters. But they are incredibly expensive. So, for most people who solely look for a reliable heater, Dyson is way too much.\nIt’s buying a Ferrari when your work is just a 5-minute walk around the block.\nSo, let’s have a look at other interesting space heaters:\nVornado: Unique vortex airflow technology at a low price point Vornado space heaters are among the most frequently sold space heaters in the US. They claim to be more energy efficient than other space heaters due to the spiraling vortex airflow that can beam heat across the room and heat your space evenly.\nI debunked some of their marketing statements in the article “ Are Vornado Fans Worth It?”.\nThe vortex airflow, although it is an interesting idea, does not perform as advertises. Although the airflow is strong, it does not really heat better than a space heater that doesn’t use a built-in fan.\nIt’s mostly marketing. Still, Vornado heaters are very reliable and many people love them.\nTheir build quality is fair… It’s mostly plastic, however.\nVornado heaters are usually under $100. So, they are very affordable.\nThey are unique, but for me, they are not a candidate for the absolute best space heater brand.\nWhich Space Heater Brands Build High-Quality \u0026amp; Safe Products? Let’s have a look at space heater brands that use high-quality materials and are, accordingly, very safe.\nDeLonghi: The Safest Oil-Filled Radiators DeLonghi produces the best oil-filled radiators. They are extraordinarily safe by design.\nNothing can beat an oil-filled radiator in terms of safety. And DeLonghi are unquestionably the best brand for oil-filled radiators.\nWhy?\nOil-filled radiators are the safest space heaters because they are full-metal devices. Their heating element is hidden inside the oil-filled heating body. So, oil-filled radiators don’t expose their heat source.\nAnd, on top of that, they work without moving parts, meaning they don’t wear down over time and last for decades.\nIf you ask me, which space heater you can run overnight, I’d always recommend a DeLonghi oil-filled radiator.\nFrequently I also recommend other brands such as Pelonis, because they are cheaper. Which is totally fine. But DeLonghi heaters are programmable and provide more safety features.\nSince we’re looking at the best of the best in this article, DeLonghi is my candidate for the safest, highest-quality, and most durable space heater.\nDr Infrared and Mr Heater: Wooden and metal casings The only two other space heater brands that come close to delivering DeLonghi’s level of quality are Dr Infrared and Mr Heater.\nDr Infrared heaters are my favorite infrared heaters because they are very sturdy and have a wooden case. I like that. They can take a hit and won’t break immediately.\nMr Heater is the only brand in this list that produces only propane heaters. The Mr Heater Buddy models are my favorite propane heaters.\nThe large vented Big Maxx models are the best heaters for garages and other large spaces. They are full metal devices!\nSince you’re probably looking for regular electric space heaters, I won’t consider Mr Heater propane heaters. They still deserve an honorable mention.\nThe Dr Infrared DR-968 is my favorite infrared heater!\nWhich Space Heater Brands Are Affordable? All of the remaining brands are affordable: Dreo, Honeywell, Pelonis, and Amazon Basics.\nDreo: Affordable alternative to DeLonghi Dreo produces regular ceramic space heaters and oil-filled radiators. And I’d say all are of good quality.\nA Dreo space heater is always a good deal.\nThe best Dreo heater is this Dreo oil-filled radiator(click to view it on amazon) which is a very good alternative to the more expensive DeLonghi radiators.\nHoneywell: Known for their 360° heaters My favorite Honeywell space heaters are these Honeywell 360-degree heaters (click to view them on amazon).\nThey are highly portable, and I love their original look.\nAdditionally, they are much cheaper than other space heaters, while still providing the same heat output!\nHoneywell space heaters are a good choice \u0026amp; very affordable!\nPelonis: The Cheapest Oil-filled Radiators Pelonis space heaters get you the most bang for your buck if you’re looking for an oil-filled radiator.\nI’ve crowned Pelonis my favorite oil-filled radiator!\nThey’re just under $100 currently.\nAmazon Basics: As Cheap As Humanly Possible You probably can’t get any cheaper than an Amazon basics space heater. But the only model that’s acceptable is this Amazon Basics ceramic heater (click to view it on amazon).\nPlease avoid other Amazon Basics heaters. They are cheap plastic devices that break easily.\nDon’t get me wrong, they will heat your room. But they aren’t sturdy and won’t last.\nConclusion Selecting the best space heater brand isn’t a straightforward task. After years of reviewing and evaluating a wide range of space heaters, I can confidently say that no one-size-fits-all solution exists.\nHowever, if you’re in the market for a premium, versatile electric space heater, Dyson is the top pick. Their heaters excel in design, technology, and feature set - covering heating, air purification, and air quality monitoring.\nFor those who prioritize safety above all, DeLonghi’s oil-filled radiators are unrivaled. They’re robust, reliable, and extremely safe, making them ideal for long-term usage.\nBudget-conscious buyers can look towards brands like Dreo, Honeywell, Pelonis, and Amazon Basics for affordable yet effective options. Just remember, you often get what you pay for.\nIn summary, the ‘best’ brand largely depends on what you’re looking for in a space heater - be it versatility, safety, or affordability. Keep your specific needs in mind, and you can’t go wrong.\nThank you for joining me on this in-depth look at space heater brands. I hope this analysis aids you in making an informed decision for your heating needs.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/whats-the-best-space-heater-brand/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere are hundreds of different space heater brands, ranging from Honeywell and Vornado to Dyson, DeLonghi, Dr. Infrared, and Mr Heater to many more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re looking to get your first space heater, all these choices can be confusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy goal with this article is to find out what the best space heater brand is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHi, I am Daniel, an electrical engineer and I’ve been writing about space heaters on heatertips.com for many years.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"What’s the Best Space Heater Brand?"},{"content":"Your electric fireplace is not working? In this article, we’ll try to get your heater working again.\nRecently, I’ve been writing several in-depth articles on heater repairs. And the issues in electric heaters are always the same.\nUsually, it’s either a power supply issue, a thermostat issue, or a blown part in the electronics.\nElectric fireplaces are a bit special. They are a lot bulkier than regular heaters. And they come with some additional features, such as the moving lights, which also can stop working.\nSo, today we’re going to look at a few unique problems common in electric fireplaces.\nAnd I guarantee you that you will know exactly how to fix your electric fireplace not working after reading this article thoroughly.\nWe’ll have a look at:\nHow to fix an electric fireplace not turning on How to fix an electric fireplace turning on, but not heating How to fix electric fireplace lighting and flame issues (no light, flames not moving, no flickering) Let’s start with the basics:\nHow to Fix an Electric Fireplace Not Turning On Electric fireplaces draw quite a lot of power. Usually 1,500W. That’s the upper end of what regular American wall outlets can supply. So, an electric fireplace not turning on at all is very likely a power supply issue.\nWhat to do if your electric fireplace doesn’t turn on at all Check the wall outlet First of all, you should test if the wall outlet you’re trying to run your electric fireplace from works.\nThe easiest test is to plug in any other device (your phone charger, a hairdryer, whatever), and see if it works.\nIf your wall outlet works fine, good. This means your home’s electric circuitry can handle the fireplace and the issue is somewhere else.\nIf your wall outlet doesn’t work, check the electrical service panel.\nCheck the electrical service panel for tripped circuit breakers Open your electrical service panel and see if the circuit breaker of the room where you run your electric fireplace is switched out of place.\nIf it is, switch it back on.\nTry running your electric fireplace again and see if it works!\nReplace the power switch If the power light does not turn on, but you can measure the voltage at the power cord’s connection point with the circuitry, inspect your fireplace’s power switch!\nVery likely it is broken and needs replacement.\nWhat to do if your electric fireplace turns on, but does not heat? Check the electric fireplace’s power indicator light Turn on the power switch of your electric fireplace. If your fireplace’s power indicator light turns on, your fireplace receives power from the wall outlet.\nSo, the power supply from the wall outlet to the heater is working. In principle that’s good, but practically, it means that the issue is somewhere inside your electric fireplace.\nOpen the fireplace and inspect the power electronics If no circuit breaker tripped and the wall outlet you’re trying to run your electric fireplace from works, the issue is somewhere inside your electric fireplace.\nOpen the back side of the fireplace. Usually, you can easily loosen the screws on the backside in order to take off the back cover.\nThat’s what I like particularly about electric fireplaces. Since they are so large, they are easy to open and all the circuitry is easy to access.\nLocate the point where the power cord enters the fireplace’s casing and connects to the internal electric circuitry.\nIdeally, you should measure voltages here using a multimeter to verify that your fireplace heater receives power.\nAfter that, visually inspect the circuitry, looking for blown parts and burn marks. Spend 5 minutes just staring at the circuitry. You can spot almost any electric problem visually.\nLook out for burn marks and blown parts. Can you spot the blown part in this image? It\u0026rsquo;s pretty obvious.\nThat’s something I learned working in the repair department of an electronics manufacturing plant. And it\u0026rsquo;s the single best electronics troubleshooting method that requires no tools.\nOnce you spot the blown part, you can find a matching replacement part online and use a soldering iron to replace it.\nOr, of course, if your electric fireplace is still within warranty, send customer support a picture of the faulty circuitry! Usually, they are more than happy to help you out and send you either the replacement part or a new electric fireplace!\nSet the highest possible temperature Since your fireplace turns on, but does not heat, I recommend setting the highest possible temperature setting.\nIf your electric fireplace has a built-in thermostat, it constantly monitors room temperature.\nAnd if, by chance, the thermostat\u0026rsquo;s target temperature is below room temperature, your electric fireplace won’t heat.\nSo, for troubleshooting electric fireplaces, always set the highest possible temperature.\nSee if that fixes the problem.\nUse the control buttons on the fireplace Also, rule out that your remote control’s batteries are empty. Turn on the heater and set a high temperature using only the buttons on the device.\nIf your fireplace starts heating, you know your remote control batteries need replacement!\nWhat to do if your electric fireplace turns on but the flames don’t flicker or light up? Check the bulb for flame effects Electric fireplaces commonly use light bulbs to simulate the appearance of real flames.\nIf your fireplace turns on but the flames don’t light up, the bulb might be the culprit.\nHere’s what to do:\nOpen the back side of the fireplace: Usually, the bulb compartment can be accessed by removing an access panel. This typically involves unscrewing some bolts or clips. Keep track of all screws and components as you disassemble parts. Inspect the Bulb: Once you’ve accessed the bulb, examine it to see if it’s burned out. If it is dark or discolored, or if the filament appears to be broken, it likely needs replacing. Replacement: When purchasing a new bulb, make sure it matches the specifications given in the user manual. Installation: Screw in the new bulb, making sure it’s snug but not overtightened. Replace the access panel and screws. Test: Plug the fireplace back in and turn it on to ensure the new bulb works and the flame effect is restored. Examine the flame motor The flame motor is what gives your electric fireplace its realistic flickering flame effect.\nIf the “flames” in your unit are not moving as they should, it may be an issue with this motor.\nThe light motor rotates this artistically shaped metal axis, which creates the flame effect. If the flames are not moving, the motor is not working!\nHere’s what you can do:\nVisual Inspection: Open your fireplace’s backside and look for obvious issues like loose wires, belt slippage, or mechanical obstructions that might be affecting the motor’s performance. Test the Motor: If your unit permits, you might be able to manually spin the motor to see if it turns freely.\nStiff movement could indicate a need for lubrication or replacement. Check Electrical Connections: Use a multimeter to check for electrical continuity. If there’s no continuity, the motor might be burned out. Lubricate: If the motor seems to be stiff but not broken, try lubricating it with a few drops of machine oil at the points specified in the manual. Replace if Necessary: If the motor is beyond repair, note down its specifications and order a new one. Replacing it usually involves disconnecting the old motor, removing it from its mount, and then reversing these steps to install the new one. Test: After making any fixes, reassemble your unit, plug it in, and test to see if the flame effect has been restored. Check for loose wiring During shipping, the electric wiring inside your fireplace could have loosened up.\nOpen your fireplace and check for unconnected connectors.\nIf you find a loose connector, plug it back in and turn on your fireplace. It should work now!\nCheck for loose connectors that look like the ones in this image! These connectors are responsible for the light controls.\nWhat to do if your electric fireplace is making unusual noises? Identify the type of noise First, try to identify where the noise is coming from and what kind of noise it is: humming, rattling, or something else.\nI’ve already written a guide on fixing space heater noises with sound samples. Have a look at that!\nInspect the fan If your electric fireplace is making a humming noise, it could be due to the fan. Make sure it is clean and not obstructed.\nCheck for foreign objects Inspect the fireplace to make sure no foreign objects are causing the noise. Sometimes a small object could have fallen inside, leading to rattling noises.\nWhat to do if the remote control is not working? Replace the batteries This seems obvious but is often overlooked. Replace the batteries in your remote control.\nTest the infrared sensor Use a digital camera or your smartphone to test if the remote’s IR sensor is working.\nYou should see a light coming from the remote through the camera when you press a button.\nWhat to do if you can’t fix your electric fireplace? You can fix most electric fireplace issues by opening the back panel and visually checking the electronic circuitry. Blown or burned parts need to be replaced. Also, check for unconnected wires.\nIf your wall outlet is working fine, and there are no apparent problems in the fireplace’s circuitry, it likely needs more in-depth troubleshooting.\nTake another 5 minutes and have a closer look. In almost all cases you can see the issue.\nIf there is no apparent problem, likely there is a hard-to-troubleshoot problem in the circuitry. If you don’t have the skills or tools to do electronic troubleshooting, please check if you are still within warranty! Oftentimes, you can get a free replacement fireplace!\nIf your fireplace is out of warranty, I recommend just getting a new electric fireplace.\nMy recommendation is this Duraflame fireplace(click here to view it on amazon).\nBuying a new fireplace is usually faster than getting your faulty fireplace fixed.\nAnd it saves you the hassle of hiring an electrician and arranging time for a visit.\nConclusion Most electric fireplace issues are easy to fix. Electric fireplaces are simple devices that consist of just a few electric components.\nThere’s not much that can break.\nUsually, the issue is either an unpowered wall outlet (because of a tripped circuit breaker) or an issue in the fireplace’s circuitry or the blower motor.\nOnly a few of the fixes in this article require special knowledge and tools.\nSo, start fixing your electric fireplace now!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/electric-fireplace-not-working/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour electric fireplace is not working?

The first statement I see when I google for electric fireplace efficiency is that electric fireplaces have 100% efficiency.\nSounds quite good, right?\nNot quite…\nThese statements about efficiencies are always misleading unless you know the physics of electric fireplaces precisely.\nIn this article, I am going to show you why the 100% efficiency of electric fireplaces is meaningless.\nAnd after tearing these marketing statements down, we’ll find out how truly efficient they are:\nBecause what really matters is:\nHow much money do you have to pay for your heat?\nHow warm do electric fireplaces make you feel?\nThe 100% efficiency claimed by electric fireplace companies has nothing to do with cost efficiency and how warm you feel. Absolutely zero.\nSo…\nThe goal of this guide is to give you a thorough \u0026amp; precise, yet simple understanding of fireplace energy efficiency.\nAnd at the end of this article, I\u0026rsquo;ll recommend you my favorite affordable \u0026amp; full-metal electric fireplace!\nElectric Fireplaces are 100% efficient: What’s the catch? Electric fireplace companies always state that their fireplaces are 100% efficient. Here’s what that means:\nAn electric fireplace converts 100% of the input power to heat.\nThat sounds like a good deal. What’s the catch?\nThe problem with that statement is that it is a universally true statement about any electric heater, and, if you take it very seriously, any electric device in general.\nAll input power that any electric device consumes eventually ends up as heat. That’s why computers and smartphones get hot when you use them.\nIn most electric devices, however, heat is considered waste energy. But in electric heaters, heat is what you want. And since all energy ends as heat, all heaters are 100% efficient.\nAny electric heater is 100% efficient. Not just electric fireplaces.\nWhy is the 100% Efficiency Statement so Prevalent in Electric Fireplaces? Electric fireplace manufacturers highlight the 100% efficiency of electric fireplaces to compare them with traditional fireplaces, which are never 100% efficient. However, this comparison is misleading!\nTraditional fireplaces use either wood or gas as fuel. And here’s the catch:\nTraditional fireplaces need to be vented. This means that in a traditional fireplace, heat escapes through the vent.\nYou can improve the efficiency of a fireplace or wood stove using a fireplace insert. But generally, it’s impossible to accomplish a 100% efficiency.\nThe hot waste gases from the burning wood need to be vented. Which creates an energy loss.\nSo, to recap:\nIn an electric fireplace, efficiency describes how much heat you get for the electric power you input.\nIn a traditional fireplace, efficiency describes how much heat you get out of your wood minus the heat leaving through the vent.\nAnd, on top of that, the wood in a fireplace never burns ideally. The burn efficiency of wood depends heavily on oxygen supply, the humidity of the wood, and the geometry of a fireplace.\nThere are many external factors that impact a traditional fireplace’s efficiency.\nSo, traditional fireplaces are technically inferior to electric fireplaces.\nWith a traditional fireplace, you get efficiencies of 80%, while with an electric fireplace, you always get 100%.\nAnd, of course, the marketing departments of electric fireplace manufacturers are riding the efficiency wave.\nElectric fireplaces are technically very efficient. But does that efficiency even matter?\nWhy Efficiency Does Not Matter Electric fireplace companies constantly state that their heaters are superior because of their 100% efficiency. But efficiency does not matter.\n( Or rather: It does not matter as much as you think it does )\nWhat really matters in a fireplace, regardless of whether it is electric, gas, or wood-based, is how well you can heat your living space with it and how much you have to pay for it.\nLet’s have a look:\nHow well does an electric fireplace heat? Since electric fireplaces are 100%, it’s pretty easy to tell how well an electric fireplace heats a room.\nAn electric fireplace outputs 1,500 Watts of heat. That’s about 5,200 BTU/h.\nThat’s the most common rating for electric fireplaces. The reason is that US-based electric circuits usually can’t handle much more electric power. US wall outlets provide a voltage of 120 Volts and trip at a current of 15 Amps. This corresponds to a power limit of 120V × 15A = 1800 Watts.\nThat’s why electric fireplaces are limited to 1,500W. If they were any more powerful, you’d risk tripping your home’s electric circuitry.\nComparison: How well does an electric vs. traditional fireplace heat? Wood-burning fireplaces output between 30,000 BTU/h and 60,000 BTU/h. That’s at least 6 times as much as an electric fireplace.\nAnd that’s one of electric fireplace’s biggest drawbacks. They just don’t get anywhere close to the heat of a real fireplace.\nBut probably that comparison is unfair. You’re probably not out looking for a real fireplace to heat your entire house in freezing winter.\nYou just want a nice-looking heat source that can keep the temperature in a living room up. And that’s what electric fireplaces are actually good for.\nI just want to make a case against the absurd efficiency claims manufacturers make:\nYes, electric fireplaces are 100% efficient. But at the same time, they output just ~20% of the total heat a wood-burning stove would output.\nElectric fireplaces are 100% efficient at only 20% of the capacity.\nThat’s why the efficiency doesn’t matter. 100% efficiency at 20% heating power is less than 80% efficiency at 100% heating power.\nguess my point is pretty clear now.\nCost-Efficiency: Are Electric Fireplaces Cost-Efficient? Okay, so after reading all of this, you might figure “If electric fireplaces output less heat, and are 100% at outputting less heat, then they must be really cost-effective”.\nUnfortunately, this is also not true.\nThe problem is electricity cost.\nWhile technically electric fireplaces are more efficient than traditional fireplaces, the price you pay for electric power is much higher than the same heating power in wood or gas.\nElectric heat costs about 8x as much as the same amount of heat from wood.\nAnd similarly, it is about 3x more expensive than the same amount of heat from gas.\nSo, if you have the chance, you should always prefer a wood-burning or gas-based heater over an electric heater.\nWood and gas are cheaper than electricity.\nAnd don’t worry: I know, you’re probably out looking for an electric heater, and you have no intention of installing a fireplace or a gas heater.\nBut this is all to build a claim against misleading marketing statements made by electric fireplace companies.\nWhen Electric Fireplaces are Efficient \u0026amp; Worth It So far, the narrative of this article was that electric fireplaces output little heat due to power limitations and are costly to run.\nBut that’s only the case when you compare them to wood or gas-burning fireplaces!\n( Which, I’d say, is a fair comparison for heaters mimicking the looks of fireplaces )\nWhen you take an isolated look at electric fireplaces, they can be well worth their money.\nHere are 2 cases of efficient use cases of electric fireplaces:\n1. Turn down central heating and supply heat with the electric fireplace Electric fireplaces are just fancy-looking electric space heaters. And space heaters can save you money when you use them correctly.\nThe idea is to reduce your central heater’s temperature setting by a few degrees. That’s just a slight change, but can save you several hundred dollars in one season depending on your home’s size.\nThen, supply heat with the electric fireplace in the rooms you use most, e.g. in the living room.\nThis results in net savings of up to $160 per year.\nI crunched the numbers. Check out the full article: Do Space Heaters save you Money?\n2. Heat rooms without a heat source Heating a room that has no heat source is always worth it. Using a portable electric fireplace is always cheaper than installing a larger heating system.\nEspecially if you live in a rental apartment, an electric fireplace can provide the warmth you need and the comfort of a real fireplace without having to agree anything with your landlord.\nSo, are electric fireplaces worth it?\nYes, an electric fireplace is worth it and an efficient means to heat if you don’t want to or can’t install a domestic heating system. Also, they can save money if you turn down central heat.\nAs you see, the efficiency of an electric fireplace does not really depend on electricity and technology. Rather, it’s all about efficient usage.\nRecommended Electric Fireplace As you know now, electric fireplaces can be efficient worth it! It solely depends on how you use them.\nMy favorite electric fireplace is this Duraflame Fireplace (click here to view it on amazon).\nMy recommendation: This Duraflame fireplace. It just works. A great product.\nI recommend this particular fireplace over others, because it’s full metal!\nPractically, it’s impossible to break!\nAnd, if you know me, I love quality products that you buy once and never have to worry about again.\nAnd of course, the Duraflame fireplace outputs enough heat to keep a regular living room warm in winter!\nIf you turn down central heat and use the fireplace as a supply heater, it can save you money.\nAnd… it’s of course 100% efficient.(wink)\nConclusion Electric fireplaces are energy efficient if you use them properly. Ideally, you run them only as supply heaters. As primary heat sources, they are only viable if you don’t have a central heating system!\nIn that case, gas or wood-burning heaters would be better.\nOverall, electric fireplaces are perfect for everybody looking to get the typical comfort of a real fireplace, but without all the installation work and without the high initial expense of a real fireplace!\nIn principle, it does not really matter which electric fireplace you pick. I recommend you the Duraflame fireplace (linked earlier), because its sturdy, reliable, and will probably last you for many years!\nHave fun heating!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-electric-fireplaces-energy-efficient/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre electric fireplaces energy efficient?

Or do they magically radiate heat through the air?\n“Infrared heaters don’t heat the air” is the single most common infrared heater myth. Since I started writing for this website, I’ve read it everywhere.\nJust for fun and giggles, I googled “Do infrared heaters heat the air?” and the (current) number one result says that “infrared heaters don’t add [heat] to the air”\u0026hellip;\nThat is plain wrong!\nHi, my name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer, who worked in the heat sensing industry! And on top of that, I’ve been conducting my own infrared heater experiments for this website!\nIn this article, you’ll learn that infrared heaters do heat the air (contrary to what everybody says), why they heat the air, and I’ll show a stupidly simple way to prove it.\nAfter reading this article, you’ll know exactly why everybody gets infrared heaters wrong (or only partially understands them).\nAnd in the end, I’ll recommend you my favorite infrared heater that can heat entire living rooms!\nDo infrared heaters heat the air? Yes, contrary to what most people think, infrared heaters do heat the air. When you run an infrared heater, room temperature rises. You can easily prove that with a thermometer.\nAlthough everybody says the opposite, this plain simple physics experiment with a thermometer proves that infrared heaters do heat the air in a room.\nThe statement “Infrared heaters don’t heat the air” is not true.\nInfrared heaters Turn Objects to Heaters However, infrared heaters heat the air through a different mechanism than other heaters.\nRegular electric space heaters work through convection. An electric heating element heats the air. And a built-in fan blows the hot air into the room.\nSo, the immediate result of running a regular space heater is hot air.\nInfrared heaters, on the other hand, radiate heat waves into the room. So, initially, the heat energy is stored in the electromagnetic waves emitted from the infrared heating elements.\nThese infrared wavelength heat waves pass through the air almost without any energy absorbtion, meaning they transfer very little energy to air molecules.\nAnd that’s where the misconception comes from!\nPeople stop at this point and conclude “Ah, that must mean, infrared heaters don’t heat the air!”.\nBut that’s wrong!\nAs soon as the radiation hits any object in your room, the object’s surface heats up. And the heated surface, in turn, creates hot air.\nEffectively, infrared heaters turn the objects in your room to heaters.\nEverything an infrared heater radiates at starts emitting heat!\nSo, infrared heaters do heat the air, although they do it indirectly.\nWhy Infrared Heaters Directly Emit Hot Air But that’s not it. The infrared radiation heat effect is just part of the heat. It’s impossible for an infrared heater to emit all the heat energy as infrared radiation.\nThat’s why you can see infrared heaters glow red. Red is not infra-red!\nRed is visible light. And infrared is invisible to the human eye.\nThis means that a large portion of the heat conversion is imperfect.\nAside from some of the radiation escaping as visible light, some energy is “lost” passing through the electric circuitry of your infrared heater, which creates direct convectional heat (hot air).\nAlso, the infrared heating tubes get very hot. I did an experiment on infrared heater safety once and found that the infrared heating elements got over 900°F hot. Of course, this creates hot air. No matter what they tell you. Any object that hot will heat the air in your room.\nAnd, on top of that, the infrared heating elements usually sit inside the infrared heater’s case. The front side of the case is open for the infrared waves to escape, and the backside (behind the infrared tubes), is usually fitted with reflective material.\nSo, half of the infrared heat energy directly escapes through the front of the heater, while the other half of the heat energy goes the other direction and is reflected.\nAnd since the reflective material is never perfect (i.e. it always absorbs part of the heat energy), it heats up and creates hot air as well.\nSo, there are three more mechanisms (aside from emitting infrared waves) through which infrared heaters create hot air:\nInfrared heating elements surface temperature: Infrared heating tubes get very hot. Mine are \u0026gt;900°F. This creates hot air. Electrical resistance: Electric components inside the infrared heater heat up and create hot air. Imperfect reflection: The reflective material sitting behind the infrared heating tubes converts some of the radiation to heat. For these 3 reasons, infrared heaters do heat the air directly.\nAnd these are the reasons why infrared heaters always have vents for hot air to escape.\nSo, even if a manufacturer claims that their infrared heaters don’t heat the air, you know they’re lying if you see the hot air vents on the top or backside of the heater!\nI can feel hot air rising from my infrared heater. If infrared heaters didn\u0026rsquo;t heat the air, they\u0026rsquo;d have no heat vents!\nAn Analogy to Prove that Infrared Heaters do Heat the Air Oftentimes, infrared heaters are compared with the sun’s radiation. And it’s actually true: The heat coming from an infrared heater feels just like the heat coming from the sun.\nHow does sunlight heat the air?\nSunrays hit the earth’s ground, which, in turn, heats up. The hot ground then heats up the air.\nThe underlying mechanism is exactly the same as in infrared heaters.\nInfrared radiation hits objects, and these objects, in turn, heat the air.\nPeople that believe infrared heaters only heat objects, must, by extension, also believe the sun heats only the ground you’re walking on, but the air remains cold. And not just cold as in “freezing cold”, but rather a “cosmic cold” (i.e. no heat at all, as in interstellar space).\nIf the logic of people claiming infrared heaters don’t heat the air was true, there’d be no life on earth.\nWhat’s the Reason to Buy an Infrared Heater over a Regular Space Heater? If all space heaters heat the air, why should you buy an infrared heater?\nOne website claims “you don\u0026rsquo;t waste energy heating an entire room”. We’ve already learned that this is false. Infrared heaters always heat entire rooms.\nHowever, we learned that infrared heaters turn objects into heaters (through radiation). And you can use an infrared heater to turn yourself into a heater (by facing it toward you).\nThis effectively turns you into a source of heat. And if you are the source of heat, you’ll feel very warm, even at low heat settings.\nSo, while an infrared heater eventually heats the entire room, your perceived warmth will be very high.\nYou will feel very warm although your room is still cold.\nSimilar to how a fire in a wood stove is warm, even though the room is still freezing cold.\nOverall, infrared heaters just feel much warmer than other heaters.\nFor more arguments, check out: Ceramic Heater vs. Infrared Heater - Which is more efficient?\nRecommended Infrared Heater My favorite infrared heater is this Dr Infrared DR-968 infrared heater(click here to view it on amazon).\nIt’s a solid device, emits heat both through radiation (through the glowing red opening) and using a built-in fan.\nSo, it heats directionally as well as overall rooms!\nThe Dr Infrared heater is a bit pricier than many other infrared heaters. But it’s absolutely worth it.\nIt works in the coldest cold, and, due to its wooden case, can take hits and falls. And it’s so sturdy, it will last you for decades!\nThe Dr Infrared DR-968 is one of the best infrared heaters on the market!\nConclusion Contrary to popular belief, infrared heaters do heat the air.\nSome simple arguments prove it.\nYou can prove it experimentally using a thermometer. And you can argue that the sun wouldn’t be able to heat the air in our atmosphere if infrared radiation would not heat the air.\nInfrared heaters are one of my favorite types of electric space heaters. They excel when it comes to heat output and energy efficiency.\nGet yourself an infrared heater! You won’t regret it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/do-infrared-heaters-heat-the-air/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDo infrared heaters heat the air?

So, I know electronics both theoretically and practically.\nAnd even if you don’t have a clue, I’ll try to help you as much as possible.\nThis is a complete troubleshooting guide. This means I’ll ask you specific questions about your infrared heater not working. And based on your answers, I’ll direct you to the cause of the issue and how to fix it!\nRemember: All electronics problems can be fixed!\nAnd: If you don’t have the skills or the tools to fix your infrared heater, you can skip to the end of this article, where I recommend you my favorite infrared heater.

And if you can’t fix it, you’ll know exactly how to replace it!\nSo, without further ado, let’s start the inspection!\nHow to Fix an Infrared Heater Not Working: Troubleshooting There are many different ways an infrared heater can possibly “not work”.\nSo, let’s start with one simple question:\nWhat does your infrared heater do when you turn it on?\nThe following scenarios are possible:\nInfrared heater not turning on at all Probably the most common case is when your infrared heater doesn’t turn on at all.\nAnd with that, I mean that it does not do anything. Neither the power light turns on, nor a display. Nothing. Your infrared heater shows no signs of life.\nAlso, it doesn’t matter if you use the remote or you press the power button directly on the device.\nLuckily, this is pretty easy to troubleshoot.\nIf your infrared heater doesn’t turn on at all, it apparently does not receive electric power. So, the potential cause can be anything in your home’s electric circuit, the wall outlet, or the power electronics of your infrared heater.\nLet’s have a look at all possible reasons, starting with the simplest.\nTripped circuit breaker / Blown fuse Common infrared heaters draw 1,500 Watts of power from the wall outlet. Many US home circuits, however, can only handle 1,800 Watts of power at a time.\n( I am talking about circuits with a 15 Amps circuit breaker or fuse here - that’s the lowest common rating )\nSo, if any additional (large) devices run on the same circuit as your infrared heater, likely a circuit breaker tripped.\nHow to fix it To fix it, go to your home’s electric service panel and check that none of the circuit breakers tripped. If you live in an older home, check the fuses in the service box.\nSwitch back the tripped circuit breaker. Replace the blown fuse with one of an identical rating. Just take out the blown fuse and bring it to an electronic hardware store. They’ll hand you a fuse with an identical rating.\nElectric service box: Check that all switches are flipped in the same direction!\nBroken wall outlet Since infrared space heaters draw such high electric currents, it is possible that your wall outlet broke. Sometimes, current surges can cause electric circuit components to weld together, creating a short circuit.\nThe easiest way to check this is to try running your infrared heater off a different wall outlet, ideally also in another room. If it works with the other outlet, then the original wall outlet is broken.\nHow to fix it To fix it, you can buy a heavy-duty replacement wall outlet (click here to view it on amazon). As you can see, they’re very cheap. Then, I recommend watching a YouTube tutorial on wall outlet replacement!\nSeeing how it’s done visually is much better than what I can describe here.\nBroken power cord Your infrared heater’s power cord might be broken. It could have a loose contact from frequent movement.\nMove the power cord and try turning on your infrared heater. If it turns on sometimes, there’s a loose contact.\nHow to fix it To fix a broken power cord, disassemble your infrared heater to gain access to the power cord’s connection point to the electric circuitry. Likely, you’ll need to unsolder it.\nThen, get a heavy-duty extension cord for space heaters, cut off the female end of it, strip the wires, and resolder the new cord in place.\nBroken connection or blown part in the power electronics The last possible cause is that something in the electric circuitry broke, for example, due to impact, or due to voltage surges.\nDisassemble your infrared heater and check the electric circuitry. Usually, you are able to make out the broken part by visual inspection.\nLook for burn marks and deformed electronic components.\nHow to fix it To fix it, get a matching replacement part in an electronic components store and solder the replacement part in place.\nAs you’ve seen, some fixes require some electric knowledge and tools such as a soldering iron.\nIf you can’t fix your infrared heater not turning on at all, skip to the section “What to do if you can’t fix your infrared heater?”\nInfrared heater power light turns on, but doesn’t heat Your infrared heater’s power light is on, signaling it should be working, but you’re not feeling any heat coming from it?\nHere are some common scenarios for this issue and ways to address them.\nHeating Element Not Set in Place Sometimes the heating element may get dislodged due to moving the heater around, vibrations, or after a cleaning session.\nHow to fix it Make sure the heating element is properly set in place. If not push it back into its place.\nIf the heating element starts heating now, you can turn off your heater, and adjust the heating element’s contraption to hold the heating element more firmly in the future.\nUsually, you can bend the loose end of the contraption. That should fix the problem!\nInfrared Heating Element Broken A broken heating element can cause your infrared heater to stop emitting heat while still showing a power light.\nHow to fix it The simplest test for a broken heating element is to look at it directly. Often, a broken element will have areas that are darker than the rest. These are burn marks.\nDepending on the type of infrared heating element, it might be see-through with a metal wire passing through it. If the metal wire is broken, the heating element is broken.\nIf the heating element is indeed broken, your best option is to replace it. Some heaters have elements that are user-replaceable. Refer to your manual for specifics on how to replace it, or consider hiring a professional.\nBut oftentimes for infrared space heaters under $200, all that trouble is not worth it. Jump to the section “What to do if you can’t fix your infrared heater?” where I recommend you my all-time favorite infrared heater.\nCheck that your infrared heater\u0026rsquo;s heating elements sit firmly in place. Some infrared heaters have a contraption, where you can take out the tubes and replace them.\nBlown Part or Short Circuit in Heat Control Circuitry Sometimes, a short circuit or blown part in the heater’s control circuitry might prevent it from heating even if the power light comes on.\nHow to fix it Open up the heater and examine the circuit board for any obvious damage such as burnt components or disconnected wires.\nIf you identify the broken part, you may be able to solder a new component in its place. If you’re not comfortable doing this yourself, hire someone to fix it and point them to the issue.\nOr just get a new infrared heater!\nThermostat Set Too Low One obvious cause can be a thermostat set too low. The thermostat controls the heat output of your infrared heater.\nAnd when you set a target temperature that is below your current room temperature, the heater will monitor room temperature and wait for it to drop below the target temperature. But during that time, it won’t turn on the infrared heating elements.\nHow to fix it Check your heater’s thermostat setting. If it is set to a temperature lower than the room’s current temperature, then the heater won’t turn on.\nAdjust the thermostat to a higher setting and see if the heater starts producing heat.\nTip-Over Protection Active Almost any infrared heater has a built-in tip-over protection feature that prevents it from heating if it’s not upright.\nFor floor infrared heaters, this is usually a button at the bottom of the infrared heater’s casing. When the infrared heater stands on firm ground, the floor presses the button, and tells the heater that heating is safe.\nThat’s why many infrared heaters won’t turn on standing on soft carpet.\nAlso, the tip-over protection can get stuck.\nHow to fix it Ensure that your heater is on a flat, stable surface. Test it on a wooden or tiled floor before placing it on carpet.\nIf the tip-over protection is stuck, a firm smack on the sides might unjam it.\nInfrared Heater Turns On But Keeps Turning Off on Its Own Dust causes the heater to overheat Many modern heaters have a built-in overheat protection. The overheat protection constantly monitors your infrared heater’s temperature. When it gets too hot, your infrared heater automatically turns off.\nIf your infrared heater shuts off too early, the overheat protection either sends false signals to the heater’s temperature control unit, or your heater actually gets too hot.\nThis can happen if your heater is clogged and there’s little airflow.\nHow to fix it Ensure the heater is not in an enclosed space and has plenty of air circulation. Clean any filters and airways and remove any obstructions that might be causing it to overheat.\nI highly recommend disassembling your infrared heater and removing all dust you find. Oftentimes models with built-in fans accumulate tons of dust over the years, which causes the heater to overheat and trigger the overheat protection.\nThoroughly unclog and dust off your heater and it should work again!\nDisassemble your infrared heater and dust off the internals!\nOverheat protection mechanism faulty If it doesn’t work, then your heater’s overheat protection mechanism is faulty.\nOftentimes, an infrared heater’s overheat protection is a simple piece of sheet metal that bends when temperature increases. When your heater gets too hot, the metal piece touches an electric contact which signals the heat turn off.\nPlease note that there are many different sorts of overheat protection mechanisms. But this is one I found very error-prone.\nBecause on impact this piece of metal easily bends and now trips the overheat protection way too early.\nHow to fix it Disassemble your infrared heater and locate the overheat protection. If it is the metal sheet protection I just described, simply bend it away from the contact it is touching or almost touching.\nNow, your infrared heater will heat to higher temperatures without tripping the overheat protection!\nLoose Contact Due to Heat Expansion This one is rather unlikely. But if nothing worked for you so far, this is the last possible cause I can think of:\nThe heat inside your infrared heater causes components to expand, resulting in a loose electrical contact.\nYou can try to run your infrared heater outdoors, in the cold, and see if it works better there. If it works outdoors but not indoors, it’s indeed due to this issue.\nHow to fix it Arguably, this issue is going to be very hard to fix. The reason: Material expansion is a microscopic effect. You just can’t see it with your eyes.\nAny loose contact that is triggered through such material expansion, is, therefore, microscopic as well.\nMy recommendation:\nGive your infrared heater a firm smack. Press all infrared heating tubes into place to ensure they are connected. Then, try to run your heater again.\nIf it doesn’t work, get a new infrared heater (skip to the last section of this article for that). Troubleshooting microscopic issues is usually a waste of money.\nInfrared heater turns on, but the fan doesn’t blow Not all infrared heaters have built-in fans. And, arguably, infrared heaters don’t need fans because they radiate the heat.\nSo, here’s a quick hack:\nIf your infrared heater works, but only the fan doesn’t blow hot air, you don’t have to fix it. Most infrared heaters work just fine without the built-in fan.\nSo, you don’t have to take action.\nBut if you want to get your infrared heater fan to blow air again, here’s what to do:\nFan stuck The simplest reason for your infrared heater’s fan not blowing air is that it’s stuck. That’s obvious.\nUnfortunately, many infrared heaters hide their built-in fan deep inside the casing. Or, oftentimes, it’s behind a protective grid.\nHow to fix it To fix it, you have to disassemble your infrared heater until you have access to the fan.\nManually rotate the fan. Does it turn easily? Or is it blocked?\nIf it’s blocked, figure out what blocks the fan. It could be something simple such as another object blocking it, or the fan’s bearings could be broken (which is unlikely).\nRemove the object that blocks the fan’s movement. It might be a large broken-off plastic part from within your infrared heater. Or it might be a small, lightweight part your infrared heater’s fan sucked in, that got stuck.\nYou might have to replace the fan with a replacement fan if you can’t get your fan to work. You can get replacement parts either from a dealer or, if you know electronics well, you can get any fan with matching specifications.\nIn any case, I recommend adding some lubricant to the fan’s rotational axis.\nIt’ll work better in the future.\nFan power supply wires broke or loosely connected Another possible cause is that your infrared heater’s fan power supply wires are not properly connected.\nThis can happen due to micro-movements over years of usage, or when the fan was simply not connected carefully by the manufacturer.\nInfrared heater fans usually have two wires (one red, one black) through which you power them.\nThese are either soldered onto the electric circuitry or plugged in.\nHow to fix it Make sure the fan is properly wired with the electric circuitry. You might have to use a soldering iron for this.\nInfrared heater turns on but makes weird noises There are many different reasons for an infrared heater making noises.\nI’ve already written a complete article on how to fix space heater noises (with sound samples).\nSo, check that out!\nQuick recap:\nMany noises are expected in infrared heaters. Clicking noises usually come from the thermostat control or from parts expanding and releasing pressure.\nHumming comes from the power electronics or from the infrared heating elements.\nBut if your infrared heater makes harsh noises such as buzzing, squealing, or whistling, something is definitely off and you have to fix it!\nCheck out the guide on troubleshooting space heater noises I linked above!\nWhat to do if you can’t fix your infrared heater? The main problem with fixing infrared heaters is that you have to know what you’re doing.\nSome fixes are simple, but others require you to solder and inspect electric circuitry.\nThat’s too much for most people.\nBefore you conclude you can’t fix your infrared heater, here’s a quick checklist of what to do before you give up.\nTo fix your infrared heater not working:\nLift your infrared heater and firmly smack it on the back Open its case and remove all the dust Push all infrared heating tubes in place Plug it into another wall outlet If these 3 quick fixes don’t work, your heater likely needs a “skilled” fix that requires knowledge and time.\nIf you don’t have the skills required to fix your infrared heater, I recommend just buying a new one.\nHere’s my recommendation:\nRecommended infrared heater My favorite infrared heater is this Dr Infrared DR-968 heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nI recommend this particular model on this website for years already and can’t recommend it enough.\nIt’s got everything an infrared heater needs: Instant heat output, a thermostat with all safety features, and a nice, solid wooden case that can take a hit without breaking.\nThe Dr. Infrared stands out from other infrared heaters because it will last you for many years, if not decades, guaranteed!\nSo, that’s my favorite. And if you got sick of your broken infrared heater, get this one. You won’t regret it.\nIt might not look as neat as other modern infrared heaters. But it just works. And works. And works.\nWhat to do with your broken infrared heater Before you dispose of your broken space heater, I recommend you put it on an online marketplace (eBay, Craigslist, Facebook, or similar) for a price you think is too high.\nWhy?\nThere are hundreds of people in the US buying broken electric devices, and fixing and reselling them professionally.\nIf you originally paid $100 for your infrared heater, you can still sell it for $50, even though it\u0026rsquo;s defective!\nSo, reclaim some of your money!\nConclusion Fixing an infrared heater not working is either easy or super hard. There’s no in-between.\nWith this troubleshooting guide, we covered all possible causes and how to fix them!\nAnd even if you can’t fix your broken infrared heater, you now know the best replacement heater to get instead!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-an-infrared-heater-not-working/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour infrared heater suddenly stopped working and you have no idea how to troubleshoot it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen this article is for you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHi, my name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer and I’ve worked in an electronics manufacturing plant before!

Of course, there is not a single right answer.\nIn this article, we’re going to have a look at 4 different space heaters that will work in your shed.\nI’ll also explain in which situation each of the recommended heaters is best for you.\nAnd in the end, we’ll have a quick look at some simple steps to improve your shed’s insulation. Insulation and heating go hand in hand, even in a shed!\nAs an electric engineer, I am always frustrated about generic and unhelpful advice online. My promise:\nAfter reading this article, you’ll know exactly which heater is best for your shed!\nWhich Heaters Are Good for Sheds? Most space heaters are strong enough to heat most sheds. If your shed is not both unusually large (\u0026gt;200 square feet) and uninsulated, you can probably heat your shed well with any space heater.\nRegular sheds are usually so compact that heating power is not a concern.\nBut the source of the heat is.\nWhat the best heater is for your shed depends on the following questions:\nAre you looking for a fixed installed heater or should it be a portable heater? Does your shed have access to electricity? Is your shed weatherproof? Here’s the quick answer:\nFor most sheds, a portable or wall-mounted propane heater is the best choice. They output the most heat for the least cost. Alternatively, you can use a heavy-duty extension cord to power an electric infrared heater or an oil-filled radiator in your shed.\nAnd, of course, the better your shed’s insulation, the better it will heat up.\nSo, let’s start with the simplest possible heating solution for most sheds, a propane heater:\n1. Best Heater for Most Sheds: Dyna-Glo Wall-mounted Propane Heater Even though this heater might not be suitable for your situation, stick out.\nMy first recommendation that works with most sheds is this Dyna-Glo wall-mounted propane heater (click to view it on amazon).\nI ranked this heater the #1 for most sheds for the following reasons:\nNo electricity required: Propane heaters run independently of your home’s electric circuit. It doesn’t require a wall outlet or an extension cord in your shed. All you need is a propane tank. Cheap to run: Propane heaters are cheaper to run than electric heaters. In the long run, you’ll save money compared to running an electric space heater. Outputs more heat than electric heaters: Propane heaters output much more heat than electric space heaters. In the freezing winter this can make a huge difference.\nWhile a regular electric space heater might keep the shed at mild temperatures, a propane heater will keep it at any temperature all year round. Emergency heat: In an electric outage you can rely on your propane heater. Since it works without electricity and you can store large 100lb propane tanks in your shed, you can use a propane heater as a backup heater to rely on. The Dyna-Glo wall-mounted propane heater is perfect for most sheds!\nPersonally, I consider all these points to be very strong reasons to get a propane heater for your shed over an electric heater.\nBut of course, there are downsides.\nThis particular model, for example, has to be wall-mounted. While that’s great for a permanent installation, it can be impractical if you plan to move your heater around a lot.\nAnd also, you’ll need to get propane refills. Propane tanks last a very long time. But, depending on your usage, you’ll have to get a 100lb refill every month or at least every year.\nOverall, I’d say: A wall-mounted propane heater is technically the best shed heater. They output more heat and are cheaper to run than electric heaters. And they don’t take up precious floor space.\nBut you’ll have to refill the propane.\nIf that’s not for you, you should get an electric heater.\n2. Best Portable Shed Heater: Mr. Heater (Big) Buddy My all-time favorite propane heater is the Mr. Heater Big Buddy portable propane heater(click to view it on amazon).\nMr. Heater Buddy series heaters come in three different sizes, the\nLittle Buddy Buddy and Big Buddy (the one I linked above) All of them are great heaters. But for most sheds, I’d say you should pick the Big Buddy.\nPersonally, I have the Mr. Heater Buddy (the medium-sized heater), and I wish I’d bought the bigger heater instead!\nThe Mr. Heater Buddy heaters are probably the most popular portable propane heaters in the world. And I’ve been writing about them a lot. They are safe and work in harsh circumstances such as in tents and even at high altitudes.\nSo:\nAnd since they reliably heat in these conditions, they will definitely work in your shed.\nBut in which case should you pick such a portable propane heater over a wall-mounted propane heater?\nThat’s simple:\nIf you plan to move your heater around a lot, or if you want to heat other spaces such as your garage or a workshop, then you should get a portable propane heater.\nYou can take them literally anywhere.\nAnd what I like most:\nPortable propane heaters don’t necessarily provide less heat than wall-mounted propane heaters.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Buddy (recommended in this section), for example, outputs 18,000 BTU of heat energy per hour. The wall-mounted heater (recommended earlier) outputs 20,000 BTU per hour. So, the heat output is roughly identical.\nExcept for the fact that you can’t mount a portable heater to the shed’s wall, there is absolutely no drawback to getting one.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my Mr. Heater Buddy propane heater: Totally reliable \u0026amp; works in the freezing cold.\n3. Best Electric Heaters for Sheds The heaters we checked so far all require propane gas to run. Of course, you can also use an electric heater for your shed!\nAll you need is access to electricity.\nIf you don’t have access to electricity in your shed right now, probably the easiest solution is to get a heavy-duty extension cord for space heaters and connect it to the nearest wall outlet (e.g. at your nearby garage, or the patio).\nIn general, you can’t miss with this 100 ft. heavy duty extension cord (click to view it on amazon).\nPlease note that this cord has a length of 100 feet. Usually, this fits most house \u0026amp; shed constellations. But if your shed is either closer or farther away from your house, you can pick a length that better suits you.\nNow that the electricity question is settled, let’s pick a heater.\nIn my opinion, the best electric heater for a shed must be either an infrared heater or an oil-filled radiator.\nInfrared heaters are very energy-efficient and provide heat a lot faster than other heaters. After turning my infrared heater on, I can sense heat within a couple of seconds!\nOil-filled radiators on the other hand provide a much more comfortable form of heat since they don’t rely on heat radiation. Instead, they heat the air in your shed.\nAlso, they are safer. And, since they are usually full-metal devices, they are absolutely weatherproof.\nHere are my recommendations:\nInfrared Heater For Quick \u0026amp; Efficient Heat I recommend this Heat Storm infrared heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt heats instantly, and, on top of that, you can mount it to your shed’s wall or to the ceiling.\nSo, it doesn’t take up any floor space.\nAlso, since you radiate heat downward from the wall or the ceiling, the heat feels very natural. Just like the sun in summer.\nOil-filled Radiator That Lasts Decades Oil-filled radiators are very durable. They are especially useful in sheds that already have basic insulation since they heat the entire space inside your shed.\nThe better insulated your shed is, the better an oil-filled radiator works.\nMy grandpa used an oil oil-filled radiator in his workshop for decades. Since these types of heaters don’t have any parts that get excessively hot and they don’t contain any moving parts that wear down over time, oil-filled radiators are practically indestructible.\nI recommend getting this De’Longhi oil-filled radiator(click here to view it on amazon).\nIt will last. Guaranteed.\nQuick Recap: When to pick which heater Here’s your guideline in which case you should pick which shed heater:\nWall-mounted propane heater: Best for sheds where a permanent heating solution is desired. Doesn’t require electricity and outputs more heat than electric heaters. Requires periodic propane refills.\nThis is the best heating option for most sheds. Portable propane heater: Best for those who need a portable heating solution that can be used in multiple spaces. Similar heating efficiency to a wall-mounted propane heater.\nPick this heater if you plan to use the heater in different spaces. Electric infrared heater: Your choice if you have access to electricity and want fast, efficient heat. Can be wall-mounted to save floor space.\nPick this heater if you don’t want to worry about propane gas refills. Oil-filled Radiator: Another electric option that’s durable and provides comfortable heat over a longer period. Best for insulated sheds.\nPick this heater if you don’t want to worry about propane gas refills and you want your heater to be weatherproof! How to Insulate Your Shed for Better Heating No matter how powerful your heater is, a poorly insulated shed will always feel cold and will also burn through fuel or electricity at a much higher rate.\nIn the freezing wintertime, insulation makes the difference between being able to keep the temperature above freezing and actually reaching comfortable levels.\nYou know your shed much better than I do. And I don’t want to preach about insulation too much.\nBut let’s have a look at a couple of simple shed insulation tips that can make a large difference:\nReflective Insulation Probably the simplest way to really make a large insulation difference in your shed is to add a layer of reflective insulation to the walls.\nI recommend this SmartSHIELD insulation roll (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis type of insulation reflects heat back towards its source, making it useful for both retaining heat in the winter and reflecting heat away in the summer.\nInstalling a radiant barrier is usually as simple as stapling the material to your shed’s walls or roof.\nYou can also cover your shed’s windows with it.\nReflective insulation wraps make a large difference! You can even cover your shed window with a layer of reflective insulation.\nUnder-Door Air Draft Stoppers \u0026amp; Door Sweeps One of the most overlooked aspects of insulation is the gap beneath the door. This small space can let in a surprising amount of cold air, undermining your heating efforts.\nInstalling an under-door air draft stopper takes no more than half an hour, and the difference is immediately noticeable.\nI recommend this all-season door sweep(click to view it on amazon).\nWeather Stripping You can also install some simple weather stripping around doors and windows to prevent drafts and heat loss. It is one of the cheapest yet most effective ways to improve your shed’s insulation.\nI recommend this Duck Brand weatherstripping seal(click here to view it on amazon). It’s a simple stick-on solution that can go a long way in keeping your shed warm\nSeal Gaps and Cracks If you’re not ready for a big insulation project, even small efforts can make a difference. For instance, sealing gaps and cracks around windows and doors with caulk can prevent drafts. Weatherstripping is another simple option for doors and windows.\nBy combining these various forms of insulation, you’ll create a shed that’s not just warm, but also energy-efficient.\nIn the long run, proper insulation will pay for itself by reducing the amount of fuel or electricity needed to keep your shed comfortable.\nAn uninsulated shed just won’t heat well in the freezing wintertime.\nConclusion If I had to pick a heater for my shed today, I’d always get a propane heater. They output much more heat. And I just like the feeling propane heaters provide.\nThe propane flame and the glowing red hot heating panel just make a cozy shed.\nElectric heaters are, of course, also possible if your shed has access to electricity. But these always have lower heat output and electric heaters are more expensive to run than propane heaters.\nInsulation is the key counterpart to effective heating. Simple steps like adding reflective insulation and weather stripping will make heating more effective and efficient, regardless of which heater you choose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-shed-heaters/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhat’s the best heater for a shed?

Which heater is best for your garage depends largely on your garage’s size, the power source you want to use (electric or fuel-based heating), and your willingness to install things.\nIn this article, we’re having a look at the best garage space heaters. And I guarantee you, you’ll know exactly which model is right for you after reading.\nWe’ll have a look at the best heaters for different garage sizes.\nQuick answer: The best space heaters for garages are regular electric heaters for 1-2 car garages, portable propane heaters for 2-3 car garages, and vented gas heaters or heavy-duty electric heaters for 4 car garages or larger.\nBest Space Heaters for Garages by Size Let’s have a look at the best garage heaters. We’ll check the following garage sizes in order, starting with the smallest and ending with the largest:\nsmall garages (1 or 2 cars) regular garages (2 or 3 cars) large garages (4 or more cars) 1. Best for Small Garages (1 or 2 cars) The best space heater for small garages is this Dr. Infrared heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nMy two main reasons are:\nSturdiness: The Dr. Infrared heater has a wooden casing that can take hits. It doesn’t just break. And it blends in well in most garages. Infrared heat: The Dr. Infrared heater, as the name suggests, emits mostly infrared heat. This makes it very quick to heat up. And on top of that, your garage doesn’t need insulation. Of course, a well-insulated garage always heats up better than a non-insulated garage.\nIn any case, the Dr. Infrared provides a lot of heat very quickly. Just perfect for a garage.\nSometimes, infrared heaters are not ideal, because their exposed heating elements get very hot. I measured the temperature of my infrared heater’s heating elements. It was \u0026gt;800°F.\nInfrared heaters are, therefore, only safe to use in small garages if you don’t use your garage as a space in which you work with easy-to-ignite materials.\nDon’t worry, infrared heaters won’t just randomly ignite things. Metal and wood have ignition points well above what an infrared heater can output.\nBut petrol can easily catch fire. Or, tires can melt or deform if you face the infrared heater directly at them.\nSo, while an infrared heater is the best small garage heater in most cases, it’s not the best in all cases.\nExtra-safe for Small Garages: Oil-filled Radiator If safety is a concern in your garage, I highly recommend getting this DeLonghi oil-filled radiator (click here to view it on amazon).\nOil-filled radiators are the safest space heaters by design. They have no exposed heating elements and, instead, distribute the heat evenly over the large finned metal heating body’s surface.\nBecause the heat is not focused in one point, the surface temperature of an oil-filled radiator is much lower than that of any other space heater.\nMeanwhile, oil-filled radiators provide the same heating power as infrared heaters.\nThe only difference is that infrared heaters focus the heat in one direction only, while oil-filled radiators heat the whole room evenly.\nIt’s a matter of preference.\nAnd, of course, the DeLonghi can take hits as well. It’s a full-metal device.\n2. Best for Regular Garages (2, 3 cars) For well-insulated 2-car garages, you can usually use the same electric space heaters recommended in the previous section:\nDr. Infrared heater DeLonghi oil-filled radiator But for poorly insulated 2-car garages and all 3-car garages, I recommend upping the heating power.\nUnfortunately, 1,500 Watts is the most heating power regular electric space heaters provide. Beyond that, you’ll need special electric circuitry and installation.\nSo, it’s time to switch power sources:\nFor most 2-3 car garages, I recommend getting the Mr. Heater Big Buddy propane heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt outputs 3x more heat than a regular electric space heater.\nOf course, you can also run it on lower heat settings.\nAdditionally, propane heat is much cheaper than electric heat.\nIn general, once you want to heat spaces beyond a certain size, you can’t reasonably rely on electric heat anymore. Propane heaters beat electric heaters in cost \u0026amp; power.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Buddy is also portable, which, combined with its strength, makes it a perfect emergency heater.\nIn an outage, you can bring it indoors and keep your family warm. I love it.\nI have the Mr. Heater Buddy model. That\u0026rsquo;s the smaller version of the Big Buddy. If I could pick again, I\u0026rsquo;d pick the Big Buddy!\n3. Best for Large Garages (4 or more cars) The best overall space heater for large garages is this Mr. Heater Big Maxx vented gas heater (click to view it on amazon).\nI already crowned this model the best vented gas heater.\nIt is just perfect for garages. You can mount it to the ceiling, so it doesn’t take up floor space.\nAnd it outputs enough heat to keep even the largest garages toasty.\nThis model runs on natural gas by default but a propane conversion kit is included with the heater.\nIf you need more than 50,000 BTU/h of heating power, then you can get the larger 80,000 BTU/h Big Maxx heater(click to see it on amazon).\nIt’s even available as a 120,000 BTU/h version.\nBut for most large household garages, the standard 50,000 BTU/h model (the one I linked first) is the most suitable.\nFor commercial garages, large workshops, and warehouse-size garages, you should definitely get one of the larger variants.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Maxx is the best heater for large garages!\nWhy Vented Gas Heaters are Best for Large Garages There are plenty of reasons why you should always prefer gas-based heating over electric heating in your garage.\nFirst of all: cost.\nPropane and natural gas are much cheaper than electricity.\nAnd, on top of that, large garages need a higher heat capacity than regular-sized rooms.\nThat’s why you can’t rely on electric circuits. Electric circuits in the US trip once you draw more than 1,800 Watts from the outlet.\nThat equates to a measly ~6,100 BTU/h.\nGarages need more than that. And you can’t supply more with electricity only.\nSo, you need a different source of heat energy.\nAnd I find gas heaters are the best overall. See how the “smallest” heater I recommended in the previous section is almost 10x stronger than what electric circuits can supply.\nOf course, there are ways around:\nAlternative for Large Garages: Electric Heater Another great heater for large garages is this Dyna-Glo Dual Power heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis heater is a 15,000 Watts electric unit, which is very high for electric heaters.\nFor comparison, the strongest regular electric space heaters provide only 1,500 Watts of heating power in order to not trip circuits.\nThis heater is an exception.\nThe Dyna-Glo Dual Power outputs much more heat than most other regular electric space heaters!\nYou’ll need to hardwire it into your garage’s electric circuit, on a circuit that can handle a heavy-duty circuit breaker that can withstand high amperages.\nIdeally, hire a technician to install this electric heater for you.\nThese heavy-duty currents can be very dangerous, so only do the installation yourself if you know what you’re doing.\nAnd that’s precisely why I generally don’t recommend electric heaters for large spaces. Their installation requires expertise and things can easily go wrong.\nAdditionally, electricity is so much more important.\nA gas heater is simply better.\nAt least when it comes to heating large garages.\nThe Dyna-Glo Dual Power is a very powerful electric heater. And it’s a great choice. But overall, for large garages gas heaters should be your heaters of choice.\nHow to heat a large garage without heaters that require installation Hold on! After reading the previous section, you probably think you have to get a large vented heater or a heavy-duty electric heater to heat your garage.\nThat’s not the case.\nThere’s a workaround!\nTo heat a large garage without heaters that require installation, you can combine a standard electric 1,500-watt heater with a portable propane heater.\nThe portable propane heater recommended earlier provides up to 18,000 BTU/h. That’s an equivalent of 5,275 Watts.\nYou can top the heating power up by an additional 1,500 Watts with an electric space heater.\nThat adds up to 6,775 Watts, which is in the ballpark of many garage heaters. I’ve seen many garage heaters rated at 5,000 - 7,500 Watts.\nThis way you use two portable space heaters to reach a very high overall heating power without installation.\nYou can use the portable propane heater and the portable electric space heaters recommended earlier.\nYou can combine your propane heater with an electric space heater (such as the oil-filled radiator in the image) to get more heating power!\nHow can you improve heating efficiency in your garage? Everybody knows that garage insulation helps. If your garage holds more heat, you need less heating power to heat your garage.\nThat’s obvious.\nThere’s a simpler way to easily improve the heat efficiency of any poorly insulated garage.\nInstead of thoroughly insulating everything, just fix what causes the largest heat loss.\n20% of critical insulation is responsible for 80% of heat loss.\nMost garages have one weak spot:\nMost heat leaves your garage through gaps below doors.\nSo, simply add a Garage Door weather seal (click here to view it on amazon) to your garage door. This eliminates a large portion of the air drafts and saves you a lot of electricity and gas (for heating) in the long run.\nAlso, if your garage has regular doors, add this door weather sealing (click to view it on amazon).\nThese two types of insulation take under an hour to install and make a huge difference.\nWhy you might not need the perfect-size heater for your garage So far, we checked out the best heaters for different garage sizes and how to add simple insulation to your garage.\nThe goal: Provide enough heating power to keep your garage at comfortable temperature levels.\nBut oftentimes, you might not even need the perfect-size heater for your garage.\nFor some of you, keeping your garage from freezing is enough. And for some others, mild temperatures are more than enough. Especially, when you are actively working and moving.\nPossibly, you don’t need a cozy garage. You just need a working space in which your fingers don’t freeze off.\nIn this case, I recommend getting one of the 1,500 Watts electric heaters recommended in the first section (“Best for Small Garages”).\nIn the freezing wintertime, an electric space heater is more than enough to elevate temperatures to a mild level. Even in 4-car garages.\nLikely, it won’t get cozy warm. But if you don’t need that, feel free to get a regular space heater.\nI recommend getting the infrared heater!\nConclusion The best garage heaters are regular electric space heaters for small garages, portable propane heaters in moderately-sized garages, and vented gas heaters for large garages.\nThe heaters for large garages, however, require installation.\nYou can work around this by combining a portable propane heater with an electric space heater. Their heating power adds up since the energy sources are independent.\nYou can’t run 2 electric space heaters at once, since that would blow fuses.\nAlso, it oftentimes makes sense to add simple under-door insulation. This takes under an hour to do properly but pays off for decades!\nAnd, last, but not least:\nYou might not need to install the strongest possible heater in your garage if you are constantly moving around and working in your garage.\nAny regular space heater can keep the temperature in a mild range, even in the freezing wintertime, even in a large garage.\nIf that’s enough for you, don’t worry about getting a perfectly sized heater.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-space-heaters-for-garages/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhat’s the best space heater for a garage?

But does its size benefit you?\nOr are smaller models such as the 311 or 411 just as good?\nAlso, how does the Blueair Blue keep up with its competition?\nBlueair fiercely competes with Levoit and Coway, two of the most popular air purifier brands.\nIn this article, my goal is to answer all these questions.\nHi, my name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer, and on this blog, my top priority is finding out which heating, cooling, and air quality devices really work.\nQuick answer: The Blueair Blue 211+ is worth it if you prioritize energy efficiency, quiet operation, and a straightforward user experience. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for advanced features like app controls, voice activation, or larger room coverage, I’d rather get the Levoit Core 600S and Coway Airmega 300S .\nBlueair’s Marketing Strategy: Sizing Air Purifiers In the air purifier market, one prominent sales strategy is to advertise a series of air purifiers, with models of different sizes.\nOne example is Blueair’s Blue series, the one we’re looking at now. But there are plenty of other examples, such as the Levoit Core models or Coway Airmega models.\nAll of these air purifier series have one thing in common:\nThe largest air purifier in a model series is always much more expensive than the average-sized air purifier.\nThe Blueair Blue Pure 211+ is the biggest model on the left-hand side. Next to it are the 311 (middle) and the 411 (right).\nThis generally makes sense. However, oftentimes, the largest model is a whole different price class. Usually, it costs more than double the price of the model right below it in the size hierarchy.\nIn Blueair’s Blue series, the Blueair Blue 211+ costs more than double of what the 311 costs.\nAnd because the largest model is so expensive, the high price makes the smaller models look more reasonable.\nI want to know:\nIs this price justified? Or is it just a price-based marketing strategy to make other Blueair air purifiers look better?\nLet’s find out!\nWhat’s good about the Blueair Blue 211+? First of all, let’s have a look at what the Blueair Blue 211+ (click to view it on amazon) does well.\nAuto Mode I particularly like when air purifiers have a built-in auto mode. It just makes everyday life easier.\nJust plug the Blueair Blue 211+ into a wall outlet and turn on the “auto mode”.\nIn “auto mode” a particle sensor to monitor pollutant levels in the room and adjust the fan speed accordingly.\nIt’s a hands-free way to maintain air quality.\nAlthough, to be very strict: At this price point, any air purifier should have auto mode.\nIt’s a great feature. But it’s also an expected feature. And the Blueair Blue 211+ fulfills its duty here.\nEnergy Efficiency The unit has received an Energy Star rating. On the lowest setting, the Blueair Blue 211+ consumes just 4 Watts of power. That’s less than an LED bulb.\nThat is an absurdly low power consumption. Especially for a device the size of the Blueair Blue 211+.\nBut again, to be realistic: At a 4 Watts power consumption, the Blueair Blue 211+ won’t purify the air much.\nIt produces minimal airflow and minimal noise, which is nice.\nBut personally, I prefer to run air purifiers at appropriate fan speeds. Then I can be sure that all the air in my room is cleaned.\nIt’s a nice gimmicky feature, though. And it shows the quality of the fan and its bearings.\nMany poor-quality fans would not even rotate at 4 Watts of input power.\nFiltration Capability The dual-filtration HEPASilent technology provides faster and quieter cleaning, with claims of removing 99.99% of common allergens and 99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.1 micron in size.\nWhile these high percentages are great, they are required by the HEPA standard. So, they are not unique to the Blueair Blue series.\nDon’t get me wrong:\nThe filters are probably among the best you can get among air purifiers. But the specification is basic.\nOther brands such as Dyson, Coway, and Levoit all filter at least just as well.\nOverall, the Blueair Blue 211+ appears to be a solid, regular air purifier that provides good filtration, quality, and energy efficiency.\nBut I am missing unique features. Any air purifier in this price this price class offers these.\nIn fact, I am even missing some features, such as detailed air quality reports, smart home \u0026amp; app integration, etc.\nWe’ll have a look at what’s missing later.\nWhat’s not so good about the Blueair Blue 211+? There are even some things about the Blueair Blue 211+ that are not really good. I may be nitpicking here. But, as an engineer, I have to go into the details.\nExposed Washable Pre-filter The “pre-filter” is more a design feature than an actual filter. Yes, it does prevent too-large particles and hair from entering the purifier.\nAnd yes, it increases the HEPA filter’s lifespan.\nSo, in principle, the idea is good.\nBut the implementation is not ideal, in my opinion.\nThe exposed pre-filter is just a regular cloth that covers the lower part of the Blueair Blue’s casing.\nAlthough it is washable it can easily discolor over time.\nI did a search on amazon looking for replacement pre-filters. And there are dozens of results, some approximating a thousand reviews. This shows me that prefilters easily get damaged or permanently discolored and people are forced to get replacements.\nAnd on top of that, this pre-filter can increase airflow resistance, thereby reducing the unit’s efficiency.\nSo, what’s a better way to do it?\nInstead of exposing a piece of cloth, I’d rather use an internal fine-meshed non-cloth pre-filter that sits right in front of the actual HEPA filter. Many Coway Airmega models have that.\nIn those air purifiers, there is nothing that can discolor and needs replacement, and the pre-filter lasts for decades because it is protected inside the case.\nLacking air quality monitoring If I pay several hundreds of dollars for an air purifier, I want it to be exceptionally good in all realms of air purifier features.\nThe Blueair Blue 211+ provides a single indicator light with 3 color levels: Blue (good air quality), Yellow, and Red (poor air quality).\nIn principle, that’s a good thing.\nHowever, the Blueair Blue 211+ uses only a single regular particle sensor to judge air quality.\nThat’s acceptable for air purifiers in the $100 - $200 range.\nBut not for the Blueair Blue 211+.\nFor comparison, Dyson air purifiers provide a whole set of air quality sensors, including two different particle sensors, and two gas sensors.\nSo, they can even detect odors and unhealthy gases.\nWhile the Blueair Blue 211+ is cheaper than a Dyson air purifier, I would still love it a lot more if it provided better air quality reports.\nThe small blue indicator light indicates air quality.\nCost The Blueair Blue Pure 211+ currently costs twice as much as the Blueair Blue Pure 311, which is the smaller model in the series.\nBut it offers no more features.\nAnd the area coverage is merely 41% higher (550 sq. ft. instead of 388 sq. ft.)\nSo, you pay double to gain only 41%. I’d only pay double to gain double.\nThe pricing is not reasonable. Especially, when you consider that manufacturing cost does not double as well. Likely, it’s just 10% higher.\nIt appears that the Blueair Blue 211+ is indeed just a placeholder product to make the 311 look better.\nIt just doesn’t deliver the bang for your buck.\nAnd, if someone actually buys the 211+, Blueair profits a lot.\nComparison: Blueair Blue 211+ vs. Levoit Core 600S vs. Coway Airmega 300S So, we’ve looked at what’s good and bad about the Blueair Blue 211+. But how does it stack up against its key rivals—Levoit Core 600S and Coway Airmega 300S?\nThe quick answer: The Blueair Blue 211+ just can’t keep up.\nCheck out the other air purifiers here:\nLevoit Core 600S (click to view it on amazon) Coway Airmega 300S (click to view it on amazon) Let’s dive in.\nThe Coway Airmega 300S.\nApp \u0026amp; Voice Controls Starting with features, Coway Airmega 300S is a show-stealer.\nWith advanced voice control options, an app interface, and superior air quality monitoring, it’s packed to the brim.\nThe Levoit Core 600S provides state-of-the-art features as well; it has a detailed air quality report system, including a comparison of outdoor and indoor pollution, an app \u0026amp; voice controls.\nThe Blueair Blue 211+, on the other hand, is pretty basic. It has no voice control, no app, and basic air quality indicators. It leaves me asking: Where are the extras that should come with the price?\nI personally, don’t need voice controls and an app at all. To me, they are just fancy add-ons. And, in my opinion, not everything needs to be voice controllable nowadays.\nBut still, the lack of features shows that the Blueair Blue 211+ can’t keep up with other brands.\nFiltration \u0026amp; Energy Efficiency Filtration-wise, all three models are close competitors. They all meet the HEPA standard, which is excellent but expected.\nOn the energy consumption front, the Blueair Blue 211+ beats the competition with its 4 Watts power consumption on the lowest setting.\nCoway Airmega 300S is also Energy Star rated but doesn’t hit the low figures of the Blueair. The Levoit also can’t hit these low wattages.\nThis doesn’t mean that Blueair is more efficient than Coway and Levoit. It merely means it can run on lower power settings. And accordingly, it is quieter.\nThe Blueair Blue 211+ is great for nighttime operations, studying, and work.\nBut overall, the difference is small. All good quality air purifiers are energy-efficient. The differences are negligible.\nRoom Coverage In terms of room coverage, Levoit Core 600S is the king, covering up to a massive 3,175 sq ft. Coway Airmega 300S covers less area but still beats the Blueair’s 550 sq ft.\nThe Levoit Core 600S allegedly covers the largest area (by far)\nThe significant area coverage difference can be explained by different types of experiments performed by different brands. It could be that Blueair is just more honest than Levoit.\nAnd I personally trust the accuracy of Blueair’s 550 sq. ft. rating more than Levoit’s \u0026gt;3,000 sq. ft. rating.\nBut still, the Blueway Blue 211+ can’t technically beat the Levoit Core and Coway Airmega models in area coverage, because the pre-filter cloth blocks airflow.\nThat’s why I described it as a design flaw earlier.\nAnd remember, the Blueair Blue 211+ costs twice as much as its smaller sibling, the 311, for just 41% more coverage. That’s not the best deal if you ask me.\nTop 3 Reasons to Buy the Blueair Blue 211+ Energy Efficiency The Blueair Blue 211+ is notably energy-efficient, running at just 4 Watts on its lowest setting. If you’re concerned about reducing your carbon footprint or simply want to save on your electricity bill, this unit offers a compelling advantage over its rivals like the Levoit Core 600S and Coway Airmega 300S.\nQuiet Operation Another benefit of its low power consumption is the unit’s quiet operation. If you need an air purifier for spaces where silence is golden—such as bedrooms, study rooms, or nurseries—the Blueair Blue 211+ is an excellent choice for peaceful, uninterrupted air purification.\nSimplified User Experience While it may lack the advanced features of its competitors, the Blueair Blue 211+ offers a straightforward, easy-to-use interface. If you find voice controls and app integrations to be unnecessary complications, you’ll appreciate the no-frills approach of this model, allowing you to focus on what really matters: clean air.\nIn summary, the Blueair Blue 211+ may not be as feature-rich as its competitors, but it shines in energy efficiency, quiet operation, and user simplicity—qualities that could make it the ideal choice for your specific needs.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blueair-blue-211-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe Blueair Blue 211+ is the largest air purifier in Blueair’s Blue series.

In this post, we’re going to check out air purifiers, for small rooms.\nAnd one interesting question we’re going to answer is:\nDo you even need a small air purifier for a small room?\nThe answer is absolutely counterintuitive.\nAnd, as an electrical engineer, it is my mission to spread the truth about small-room air purifiers.\nSo, let’s start.\nSmall Room = Small Air Purifier? There’s a misconception about air purifiers that seems hard to grasp for most people. But it’s actually quite simple:\nEven if you live in a small room, you don’t necessarily have to get an extra small air purifier.\nMany other devices such as heaters or air conditioners have to fit the room’s size.\nAn air purifier does not have to fit your room’s size.\nA regular air purifier that can purify the air in large rooms can just as well purify the air in a small room.\nBenefits of Using Regular-Sized Air Purifiers in Small Rooms A regular-sized air purifier filters through the air much faster than a small air purifier. You get clean air much faster.\nWith the shorter running time, you also get less electricity cost. And, due to the shorter running time, the overall noise exposure is much smaller.\nOn top of that, with a regular-sized air purifier, you are much more flexible. You can move rooms and it will still work as expected.\nA small air purifier, on the other hand, will work in small rooms only. Small air purifiers unnecessarily restrict you.\nThat’s my philosophy.\nSmall Air Purifiers Are Worse by Design Small air purifiers not only take much longer to filter air, they also have design flaws.\nAir purifiers are devices that force air through filters.\nSo, the key component of an air purifier is the fan. And the key determinant of energy efficiency is airflow resistance.\nSome resistance is determined by the filter you use. A good HEPA filter will, of course, have some air resistance.\nBut another large portion of air resistance is determined by the design and dimensions of the air purifier.\nA large air purifier has much larger air intake holes. And also, the filter area is much larger.\nSmall air purifiers have small air intakes and a smaller filter surface area, which makes them inefficient.\nSo, it is not always the best decision to pick a small air purifier for a small room.\nOftentimes, and I’d even say usually, picking a regular-sized air purifier is still the best choice.\nThe key takeaway from this section:\nYou should only pick a small air purifier for your small room if you have severe size constraints. In any other case, a regular-sized air purifier is the much better choice.\nBest Compact Air Purifiers for Small Rooms Of course, there are great small air purifiers. But usually, regular-sized air purifiers (or at least compact air purifiers) are a much better choice.\nSo, we are not talking about big and bulky devices here! All of the air purifiers in this list still fit neatly in a cramped corner of a small room!\nLet’s have a look at the three absolute best air purifiers for small rooms:\n1. Best Overall: Levoit Core 300S The best overall air purifier for small rooms is the Levoit Core 300 (click here to view it on amazon).\nI have this same model myself. It fits neatly into every corner of a small room. You can even place it on a shelf.\nThe Levoit Core 300 is technically a very neat air purifier. It can filter your entire small room’s air thoroughly in under one hour. And you will notice the difference!\nIt has a great HEPA + activated carbon filter that does not only pick up tiny particles, pollen, and bacteria, but it can also absorb gases and odors.\nThere are two variants: The Core 300 and the Core 300S. The S-variant comes with smart home integration and is controllable via an app.\nPersonally, I don’t need those fancy features. So, I decided to get the simpler (and cheaper) Core 300!\nI love my Levoit Core 300!\n2. Best Compact: Blueair Blue Pure 511 A bit smaller than the #1 air purifier, but with equal air purifying power is the Blueair Blue Pure 511 (click here to view it on amazon).\nThe Blueair Blue Pure is perfect for small rooms. Possibly even better than the Levoit Core 300 if your room is very small.\nIt is a compact air purifier, but it is still large enough to have all the advantages of regular-sized air purifiers.\nSo, if you have size constraints, consider getting the Blue Pure 511 instead of an extra small air purifier!\nI like in particular that the Blueair Blue Pure air purifier does not have the traditional air intake holes. Instead, it comes with a washable pre-filter that covers largely open-air intakes.\nIt’s also a nice choice if you value design. The Blueair Blue Pure just looks good.\n3. Best Quality: Coway Airmega 150 I honestly feel weird putting the Coway Airmega 150 (click here to view it on amazon) on rank 3.\nIt is an absolute compact beast of an air purifier. Coway produces great quality air purifiers with very good filters.\nAlthough Coway is more expensive, their air purifiers provide so much value. The Coway Airmega 150 is one of the smaller models of the Airmega premium series.\nIt comes with built-in air quality monitoring and auto mode, which allows this air purifier to run fully autonomously without you having to turn it on and off manually.\nThe large Coway Airmega models are, in my opinion, too expensive. But the Coway Airmega 150 is a good bang for your buck.\nSo, if you can invest a bit more, I recommend this air purifier. Otherwise, get either the Levoit or the Blueair air purifier.\nThe Coway Airmega 150 has the smoothest design and comes with a built-in air quality indicator light. Here, it\u0026rsquo;s blue, indicating good air quality.\nBest Extra-Small Air Purifiers for Small Rooms If even the compact air purifiers from the previous section are too large for you and you prefer an extra-small air purifier, this section is for you.\nLet’s have a look at the best small air purifiers for small rooms.\nAnd, if you know this blog, you know I don’t tolerate bad products at all.\nSo, here are 3 small air purifiers with the best possible performance:\n4. Extra-Small Allrounder: Levoit Core Mini The Levoit Core Mini (click to view it on amazon) is, in principle, the exact same air purifier as the larger brother, the Levoit Core 300 (which I ranked #1 in this list). It’s just smaller.\nThe difference:\nIt takes up about half as much space as the larger Core 300. And you can really only use it in small rooms.\nAlthough the Core Mini is ~50% smaller, the air purification coverage decreases by ~70%. That’s due to the smaller filter surface area and the smaller built-in fan. And that is exactly why I don’t recommend these extra-small air purifiers in general.\nIf your room is under 300 sq. ft. the Levoit Core Mini will work just fine.\nBut you should always prefer the larger compact models!\n5. Extra-Small \u0026amp; Extra-Cheap: ToLife Air Purifier The last small room air purifier I want to mention is this ToLife air purifier (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt comes with a HEPA filter (just like any other air purifier), so it purifies the air thoroughly. And it comes at a much lower cost than the other purifiers in this list.\nPersonally, I don’t like the futuristic design of it. And the touch control panel “hovers” above the fan’s opening, so it disturbs the airflow.\nThat’s not ideal.\nIt’s a good air purifier, especially if you want to save money, but not a great one.\nConclusion So there you have it, a complete guide to selecting the best air purifiers for small rooms. Let’s summarize what we’ve learned:\nSize doesn’t necessarily matter: Even in a small room, a larger, regular-sized air purifier is often the better choice. They’re faster, more energy-efficient, and more versatile than their smaller counterparts. Benefits of Regular-Sized Air Purifiers: They offer speedy air purification, less electricity cost, and lower noise exposure. You’re also not boxed into using them only in small spaces, adding to their flexibility. Small air purifiers are limiting: While there are good small air purifiers, they are often less efficient and can only be used in small spaces. They should only be your pick if you have severe space constraints. Best Picks: Best Overall: Levoit Core 300S Best Compact: Blueair Blue Pure 511 Best Quality: Coway Airmega 150 And if you absolutely need an extra-small air purifier, I’d recommend the Levoit Core Mini for its respectable performance in tight spaces.\nRemember, it’s not just about getting an air purifier that fits your room but one that suits your needs. Make an informed choice, and breathe easy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-air-purifiers-for-small-rooms/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhat are the best air purifiers for small rooms?

I discovered a new product: The Bluegrass Living propane heater.\nI don’t know where this model has been all the time, but the Bluegrass Living propane heater looks neat.\nAfter spending dozens of hours reviewing both ventless portable heaters and vented propane heaters, my results were clear: Mr Heater Buddy heaters are next to unbeatable.\nBut possibly, Bluegrass Living models can compete!\nSo, let’s do a fully unbiased review.\nHi, my name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer and I write about heating and cooling methods on this website.\nThe first thing that sticks out to me when I search for Bluegrass Living propane heater reviews is: There are none. Zero.\nMy goal is to fill the void. Not just with yet another sales pitch, but with actual information, critically comparing the Bluegrass Living heater’s features with other propane heaters.\nLet’s start!\nBluegrass Living Propane Heater Review: Facts First In this review we’re talking about this Bluegrass Living propane heater(click here to view it on amazon).\nAs you can see on the linked page, it comes in 3 different sizes:\n10,000 BTU 20,000 BTU and 30,000 BTU (which is exceptionally high for a ventless heater) I highly recommend getting the largest size. With the gas knob you can adjust heat output and, therefore, gas consumption.\nSo, there is no drawback to picking the largest model. You can still run it on low temperature.\nBut if you’re ever in need of more heat, for example in an emergency, you can depend on this propane heater.\nIt comes with an Oxygen Depletion Sensor (ODS) and automatically shuts off in case of decreasing oxygen levels.\nThe Bluegrass Living heater can either stand on its feet or you can mount it to the wall, so it takes up less floor space.\nIt has a built-in blower and a thermostat, both of which work only with electricity.\nYou can, of course, run the Bluegrass Living propane heater (as any other propane heater) without electricity in manual mode.\nWhere the Bluegrass Living Propane Heater Excels Let’s have a look at what the Bluegrass Living propane heater is doing better than other propane heaters.\n1. Heat output: Higher Than Usual The Bluegrass Living propane heater outputs a whopping 30,000 BTU of heat per hour.\nThat’s more than most other portable propane heaters can output, and much more, of course, than any electric heater.\nFor a portable propane heater, the Bluegrass Living is very strong.\nIf you compare it with mounted wall heaters and large vented propane heaters, which can output 50,000 BTU/h and more, of course, the Bluegrass Living is weaker and smaller.\nBut that’s because it’s designed for large living rooms, not entire garages and warehouses.\nSo, the heat output is on point. Probably, it’s higher than you ever need it to be.\n2. Built-in Thermostat: Automatically Controls Heat Output The Bluegrass Living also comes with a built-in thermostat that shuts the heater off when room temperature reaches your desired target temperature and turns it back on when room temperature drops below a certain threshold.\nThat’s a good old two-point control, turning the heater fully on and off.\nFor a portable propane heater, that’s great! The Mr Heater Buddy models, for example, don’t come with a built-in thermostat.\nThe thermostat, however, works only with electricity. So, you need access to a wall outlet to use it.\nThe electricity is required to trigger the spark ignition.\nBut don’t worry, the heater still works without electricity! You merely can’t use the thermostat.\n3. Blower: Supports Heat Distribution To distribute the heat, the Bluegrass Living propane heater has a built-in blower.\nThe blower obviously can only work with electricity. But that’s not a big deal.\n4. Sturdy: Can Take Hits Without Breaking At 24.5 pounds, the Bluegrass Living is a very sturdy and heavy device. You can see that as an advantage and a disadvantage, depending on what you want to do with it.\nIf you use the heater mostly stationary, in your living space, in a garage or workshop, and you don’t move it around much, the weight is not a problem.\nIt shows that the Bluegrass Living propane heater is sturdy and can take hits, which happens, especially in workspaces.\nIt won’t just break. I like that a lot about this heater.\nMany other propane heaters are made of very lightweight material, which is great for carrying them around. But their light weight makes them fragile.\nIt is a solid propane heater you can rely on.\n5. Emergency Heat: Reliable Heating Without Electricity In my opinion, the Bluegrass Living is the perfect emergency heater. Without access to electricity, the thermostat and the blower won’t work.\nBut that’s not a problem. You can use the heater in manual mode, just like any other off-grid propane heater.\nYou set a heat setting, spark the heater, and there’s your heat.\nIn an emergency, you don’t need a fancy thermostat to set the perfect amount of heat.\nEither you run the Bluegrass Living on the lowest setting to consume as little propane as possible while surviving. Or, you can run the Bluegrass Living on a high setting to keep your entire living space warm, together with your family.\n6. Wall-mountable and Free Standing The Bluegrass Living comes with feet it can stand on and it comes with a wall mount. You can decide how to mount it.\nOverall, that’s a minor feature, but I like it.\nAnd I think it’s worth a mention.\nIf you already know you will use the Bluegrass Living in one place, you can install the wall mount there and save precious floor space.\nIn case you need to move the heater, you can easily take it off the wall, attach the feet, and you’re ready to go.\n7. Safety-Certified The Bluegrass Living propane heater is PFS-certified.\nThe Oxygen Depletion Sensor is ANSI-certified.\nGreat.\n8. Overall: Better Than Most Portable Propane Heaters The Bluegrass Living propane heater has none of the drawbacks of a regular portable ventless propane heater .\nRegular portable propane heaters usually output less heat and have no thermostat. Some portable propane heaters don’t even have proper safety certifications.\nThe Bluegrass Living provides a lot of heat, a thermostat, and all the safety features of a big vented propane heater.\nBut, if you want to, you can use it like a portable propane heater.\nWhat the Bluegrass Living Propane Heater Could Do Better To be honest, it is very hard for me to find any major disadvantages to the Bluegrass Living propane heater.\nSo, what I tell you now is pure nitpicking.\n1. Questionable Marketing Statements There are some slightly misleading marketing statements on the Bluegrass Living heater’s amazon sales page.\nLet’s have a look:\n“Heat for only pennies an hour!”\nIn fact, running a 30,000 BTU heater consumes 0.36 gallons of propane per hour if you run it on full power.\nThat’s almost $1 at current propane prices.\n“Economical: 99.9% efficient.”\nThat’s even an underestimate. Technically, every heater is exactly 100% efficient!\n99.9% just makes the offer sound compelling.\n2. Weight: Low Portability The Bluegrass Living propane heater is undoubtedly a robust and sturdy appliance, weighing in at 24.5 pounds.\nWhile the heaviness lends itself well to durability, it decreases portability.\nIf you plan on keeping it in a stationary position in your living space, garage, or workshop, this isn’t a concern.\nHowever, if you’re looking for a heater that you can easily move from one location to another, this weight could be annoying.\nUnlike lighter options, you might find yourself thinking twice before lifting it.\nConclusion: Should You Buy the Bluegrass Living Propane Heater? So, the ultimate question: Is the Bluegrass Living heater worth your hard-earned money?\nHere’s the summary:\nPros:\nUnbeatable heat output for a ventless portable heater (Up to 30,000 BTU) Built-in thermostat for efficient heating control (when connected to electricity) Versatile, can be wall-mounted or free-standing Extremely sturdy and durable Reliable safety features Excellent for emergency heat situations Cons:\nSlightly misleading marketing claims regarding costs and efficiency Its 24.5-pound weight makes it less than ideal for easy portability If your priorities include high heat output, the ability to control the heat efficiently, and a robust, sturdy build, then the Bluegrass Living propane heater checks all those boxes effectively. Its shortcomings are minimal and could be considered nitpicks when stacked against its strong advantages.\nHowever, if you’re in search of something lightweight and ultra-portable, you might find the weight to be a deal-breaker.\nOverall, the Bluegrass Living propane heater offers more pros than cons. Its robust features, coupled with its outstanding performance, make it a front-runner in the propane heater market. It could very well give Mr Heater Buddy models a run for their money.\nWould I recommend it? Absolutely, but with the caveat that you consider your specific needs carefully, especially regarding portability and the requirement for electrical connectivity for some features.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/bluegrass-living-propane-heater-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYay!

In depth.\nWe’re going to check:\nWhich space heaters provide the most heat? (checking heaters with and without installation separately) How much electric power do they consume? What’s the proper way to install and use them? And to round it all up: How to generate the most heat using only space heaters, but without installation? First of all, a disclaimer: Since we’re really trying to find the absolute strongest space heaters on the market, most of the recommended products on this page are way too strong for regular living spaces.\nNot just heat-wise, but also the electric power requirements are way beyond what regular US wall outlets can handle.\nSo, we’re going to start with recommendations for regular households (which are moderately-sized, but very strong space heaters).\nAnd then, we’ll continue with the absolute most powerful space heaters for garages, warehouses, workshops, sheds, and building sites.\nFor regular households: The most powerful space heaters So, if you found this article looking for the most powerful regular household space heater, then I recommend the following:\nNo installation required: Most powerful electric household space heater US home circuits provide up to 15 Amps of current and a voltage of 120 Volts. That’s a total maximum power of\n15 × 120V = 1800 Watts\nA regular US wall outlet can’t handle more than 1,800 Watts.\nThat’s why electric space heaters usually have a maximum power rating of 1,500 Watts.\nYou just can’t get any stronger. In Europe, the situation is different. There, wall outlets can handle almost twice the power. So, electric space heaters rated at 2,500W are very common.\nIn the US, the most powerful electric household space heater is this DeLonghi oil-filled radiator (click here to view it on amazon).\nActually, calling it the “most powerful” is misleading, since there are hundreds of other space heaters rated at 1,500W. But I found not a single (trustable) model that is rated higher.\nSo, with electric household space heaters you only get so far. The electric circuit is usually too weak to handle more.\nBut there’s a way around it:\nNo installation required: Most powerful propane space heater You can work around electric limitations by simply using a propane heater instead of an electric heater.\nMy favorite indoor-safe portable propane heater is this Mr. Heater Big Buddy propane heater(click here to view it on amazon).\nWith 18,000 BTU (British Thermal Units) of heat output per hour, which equates to a whopping 5,275 Watts of heating power, the Mr. Heater Big Buddy is more than three times as powerful as a regular electric space heater.\nMr Heater propane heaters are my favorite propane heaters and objectively one of the safest portable propane heaters you can get.\nThere are, of course, more choices than just the Mr. Heater portable propane heaters. Later in this article, we’ll also check out some powerful propane space heaters you can install to the wall (which output even more heat).\nFor (very) large spaces: Most Powerful Electric Space Heaters (that require installation) Now, let’s have a look at the real Champions League of powerful electric space heaters.\n1. Most powerful: Dyna-Glo Dual Power (15,000 Watts) The most powerful electric space heater is this Dyna-Glo Dual Power 15,000 Watts heater(click here to view it on amazon).\nThis electric space heater is so powerful, it needs to run on a dedicated circuit and it requires hard wire installation.\nSo, to get this space heater running, you’ll need the hand of a professional.\nThis Dyna-Glo heater blasts a whopping 15,000 Watts!\n2. Ideal for warehouses and garages: Qmark space heater (10,000 Watts) The second most powerful electric space heater is this 10,000 Watts Qmark space heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis unit draws 42 Amps from a 240-volt circuit. So, this space heater is also too strong for regular household circuits.\nThis space heater is also capable of running on a three-phase electrical system. Usually, these are found in industrial settings. Or, you can, of course, have someone install that in your home.\nFor installation, you should ideally hire an electrician.\nThat’d also be better insurance-wise in case of an accident.\n3. Requires little installation: NewAir Space Heater (4,800 Watts) This 4,800 Watts NewAir space heater (click here to view it on amazon) requires less installation effort compared to the other heaters in this list.\nIt is the only corded heater, meaning you can plug it into a wall outlet.\nThe drawback: The wall outlet has to be 240 Volts.\nSo, if you don’t have a 240 Volts outlet, you should install one or hire a technician to do it for you.\nBut aside from that, this space heater is ready to go.\nAlthough its power pales in comparison to the other powerful heaters in this list, this model is still three times as strong as regular 1,500 Watts space heaters.\nSo, that’s more than enough for most spaces!\nEven more powerful: Most Powerful Propane Space Heaters Propane space heaters can output even more heat than electric space heaters. And additionally, they don\u0026rsquo;t require you to upgrade your electric circuitry.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s also have a look at the strongest propane heaters.\nThe most powerful propane heaters are all vented. So, they also need installation. But the installation is much simpler than that of heavy-duty electric heaters.\nRecommended strong propane space heater: Mr Heater Big Maxx The strongest propane space heaters are the Mr. Heater Big Maxx models.\nI’ve already written about them in this article: 3 Best Vented Gas Heaters\nThey come in different sizes (depending on heat output).\nThe strongest model is this 80,000 BTU Mr Heater Big Maxx (click here to view it on amazon).\nThat’s equal to over 23,400 Watts of heating power!\nYou can also get the smaller variant, the 50,000 BTU Mr Heater Big Maxx (click here to view it on amazon).\nI feel weird calling this one the “smaller variant”. With 50,000 BTUs this heater likely heats any space you need heated.\nIt produces as much heat as the most powerful electric heater we checked earlier.\nThe Mr Heater Big Maxx models are great for heating construction sites, large garages \u0026amp; workshops!\nHow to get the most heat without installation? Most of the heaters recommended in this article require installation, because of their power requirements or because they need to be vented.\nIf installation is not an option for you, but you still want to produce the most heat possible, I recommend combining independent heaters.\nWhile, in a regular US household, it’s usually not possible to run two electric space heaters at once, you can run two portable propane heaters at once.\nOr you can run one electric space heater and one propane heater.\nOr three propane heaters.\nDo whatever suits your heating needs.\nThe rule is: Don’t run more than one electric space heater simultaneously.\nYou can add as many propane heaters as you like.\nTo do that, I recommend getting the DeLonghi electric heater recommended earlier and the Mr Heater Big Buddy propane heater.\nOne electric space heater combined with a strong portable propane heater will add up to:\n1,500 Watts + 18,000 BTU/h ≈ 1,500 Watts + 5,275 Watts = 6775 Watts of heating power\nMy infrared heater, combined with the Mr Heater Buddy (in the background)\nMore ideas to heat large spaces (without needing the absolute strongest heater) Running a large space heater on full power for an entire workday of 8 hours or possibly even longer can get very costly very quickly.\nThe 15,000 Watt electric space heaters recommended earlier, for example, can easily add $100 to your monthly electricity bill.\nAlthough propane is a bit cheaper, if you run the largest heaters on full power, you’ll run through propane tanks quickly.\nA 100lb propane tank, for example, an 80,000 BTU heater, for example, will only last for 22 hours before it is empty.\nInsulate to Elevate Insulation is a game-changer when it comes to heating efficiency.\nBy adequately insulating walls, floors, and especially the ceiling, you reduce the rate at which heat escapes.\nDouble-glazed windows can also make a significant difference. With good insulation, even a less powerful heater can do wonders.\nSeal the Leaks Drafts from windows, doors, and even electrical outlets can be significant heat drainers.\nSealing gaps with weather stripping or using draft stoppers can help maintain a consistent indoor temperature, reducing the amount of work your heater has to do.\nZone Heating Why heat the whole house when you’re only using a few rooms? Focusing on heating only the spaces you’re using can reduce power requirements.\nFor example, rooms with high ceilings are best heated using infrared heaters.\nThey radiate heat in just one direction and feel much warmer in large spaces.\nConclusion In a nutshell, the most powerful space heaters for regular households are the DeLonghi oil-filled radiator, maxing out at 1,500 Watts, and the Mr. Heater Big Buddy propane heater, offering 5,275 Watts.\nFor larger spaces, the Dyna-Glo Dual Power is the strongest electric space heater with 15,000 Watts, but it requires professional installation.\nIf you’re looking to heat a space without installation, your best bet is to combine an electric heater with a propane one. This will give you around 6,775 Watts of heating power, more than enough for most spaces.\nAlways remember, running multiple electric heaters on a standard U.S. circuit is a no-go, but you can mix and match with propane heaters as much as you like.\nChoose wisely based on your specific needs and always prioritize safety, especially when dealing with such powerful units.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/most-powerful-space-heaters/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eToday we’re going to have a look at the most powerful space heaters. \u003cem\u003eIn depth.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re going to check:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhich space heaters provide the most heat?

And do you have to replace water regularly? Do you need to put in any maintenance work?\nThis quick post is going to answer all of that. Luckily, it’s very simple:\nQuick answer: No, most air purifiers never need water. Air purifiers pass air through a dry HEPA filter, which needs replacement every 6-12 months. Air purifiers with built-in humidifiers, however, need water replacements occasionally. But in this case, the water is not needed for air purification.\nBefore you leave, let’s have a closer look. I am going to tell you why air purifiers work best when fully dry.\nAlso, I’ll list my recommended air purifier which does not use water.\nWhy HEPA Air Purifiers do not need water Every effective air purifier (that is backed up by lab tests) uses a HEPA filter. Sometimes the HEPA filter is layered with additional filters, such as an activated charcoal filter.\nThe heart of every air purifier, is, however, the HEPA part.\nHEPA filters contain a very fine web of fibers. And the key principle that makes a HEPA filter work is that airborne particles are so lightweight, they wiggle around a lot.\nAnd the more particles wiggle, the easier they are to catch.\n( Mathematically speaking: The chance of collision with the filter’s fibers increases )\nImagine you’re driving on a highway. And instead of staying in your lane, you switch lanes every few seconds. Naturally, the chance of collision with another object increases.\nSo, even though many particles are so tiny that they could fly straight through the filter web, they are eventually caught by the fibers.\nFor a HEPA air purifier to work, particles must move freely.\nExceptions: Air Purifiers that use water As always, there are exceptions to the rule. Here are two of them:\nAir Purifiers with Built-in Humidifiers: A Questionable Combo Air purifiers with built-in humidifiers of course need water. The water, however, is solely for humidification and has nothing to do with the purification.\nOne example is the Dyson Pure Humidify+Cool, which is a hybrid air purifier and humidifier.\nThis Dyson Pure Humidifier and air purifier has a tank of water at the base of it. Occasionally, it needs refills.\nRunning an air purifier and a humidifier at the same time, is, however, often not the best idea.\nHumidifiers can decrease HEPA filter lifespan. So, I don’t really like air purifiers with built-in humidifiers.\nAir Washers: They don’t purify the air at all Air washers, such as this Sirena Twister Air Washer (click to see it on amazon) use water to “wash” the air.\nHowever, water has next to no purifying properties.\nImagine the air in your room is polluted with tiny particles smaller than a micrometer.\nWhen you force polluted air from your room through water, the polluted air forms bubbles. Inside the bubbles, the air remains polluted.\nWhen the air bubbles leave the water and pop, they release the polluted air into your room again.\nOf course, a fraction of the particles will stick to the water. To be precise, the small part of particles that by accident touch the water surface from within an air bubble will be filtered.\nBut it is by far no way to purify the air.\nThe smallest particles are possibly even repelled by water surface tension.\nAnd, on top of that, water can’t purify gases such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, since gases form their own bubbles and escape the water again.\nSo, air washers might pick up a few dust particles here and there. But they don’t reliably purify the air at all.\n“The word \u0026ldquo;air purifier\u0026rdquo; is at best a stretch.”\nair washer customer on amazon\n“Real” air purifiers always use a HEPA filter.\nThis \u0026ldquo;air washer\u0026rdquo;, which allegedly filters air using water is largely useless and unreliable.\nMaintenance Needs for HEPA Air Purifiers But even though air purifiers never use water, they still need occasional maintenance.\nHEPA filters degrade over time and need replacement every 6-12 months.\nAdditionally, many air purifiers such as the Nuwave OxyPure come with a set of multiple filters, all of which are washable and last practically forever, except the HEPA filter.\nCoway Airmega air purifiers also have a washable pre-filter.\nNuwave and Coway are both high-end products.\nCheaper air purifiers that use just a HEPA filter don’t come with washable filters. These only require HEPA filter replacements and nothing else.\nOne example are Levoit Core air purifiers, my favorite air purifiers.\nRecommended Air Purifier: Effective \u0026amp; low maintenance My favorite air purifier is the Levoit Core 300(click here to view it on amazon). It’s a simple but highly effective air purifier, backed up by experimental pollution tests.\nI have this particular model myself and I am happy with it.\nAlso, I use this model as a benchmark for all air purifier reviews I conduct on this channel. I’ve even compared it to expensive Dyson air purifiers before. The result: The Levoit Core purifies the air just as well as premium air purifiers.\nThe reason is that air purifiers are technically just fans that blow air through a filter. So, whether an air purifier is good or bad depends solely on the filter’s quality.\nThe Levoit Core series air purifiers come with a highly effective HEPA + activated carbon filter.\nThe HEPA filter filters 99.97% of particles from the air, while the activated carbon filtration layer removes odors and gas molecules.\nConclusion: Do air purifiers need water? Air purifiers never need water. And those that do are, at best, questionable products. Pure HEPA filter air purifiers are usually the best choice for purifying the air in your living space.\nFancy add-ons like a water-based filter (such as in air washers) or a built-in humidifier (such as in hybrid air purifiers) are not necessary to purify the air. And, to be more precise:\nWater does not contribute to air purification.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/do-air-purifiers-need-water/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDo air purifiers need water?

It’s time I put my hands on it and review it!\nWhen I look for an in-depth Nuwave OxyPure review, I am surprised there is so little actual insight available. I mean there is plenty of information. But everybody just tries to sell you this air purifier, without consideration.\nAnd let me tell you: The Nuwave OxyPure is not the best choice for everybody.\nI see it as my duty to shed some light into the dark! What the heck can be wrong with this air purifier?\nIn this Nuwave OxyPure review, I am going to tell you the good and the bad, in a digestible format.\nAnd after reading, you’ll know exactly whether you should get the Nuwave OxyPure or not. And if you figure the Nuwave OxyPure is not your choice, you’ll get to know the best alternatives for this model!\nHere’s a quick outline of what we’re going to find out about:\nWhat the Nuwave OxyPure excels at: Air purification, sturdiness, lifespan and design What the Nuwave OxyPure lacks: A thorough sensor system (when compared to other air purifiers at that price point), a proper air intake design, portability Whether you should buy the Nuwave OxyPure So, let’s start:\nThe Pros: What Makes the Nuwave OxyPure Stand Out 5-Stage Filtration System: 100% Clean Air There is no doubt that the Nuwave OxyPure(click here to view it on amazon) is a great air purifier. It uses 5 stages of air filters:\nStainless Steel Pre-Filter: Washable, lasts for 20 years. Bio-Guard Filter: Washable, lasts for 20 years. Ozone Emission Removal Filter: Reusable, lasts for 20 years. But not washable! HEPA + Activated Carbon Combo Filter: Lifespan, 6 months to 1 year. Not Washable. After passing through all these filtration layers whatever comes out the other end of the air purifier is definitely clean.\nNuwave OxyPure collects 100% of particles down to 0.09 microns Nuwave states that their filtration system captures 100% of particles down to 0.09 microns. That’s a bold statement. How can they be so sure it’s 100%?\nHere’s why: There are studies that show that HEPA filters catch different particle sizes differently well. One thing is obvious: A HEPA filter can easily catch large particles.\nNow you might assume that smaller particles are harder to catch. Which they are. But only down to a size of 0.3 microns.\nBelow this critical size limit, particles are, again easier to catch. These too-small particles are so lightweight, they wiggle around a lot due to Brownian motion that their chance of being caught increases to close to 100%.\nActually, 0.3-micron particles are hardest to catch!\nThe marketing statement “Captures 100% of particles down to 0.09 microns” is misleading. Particles that are 0.09 microns are easy to catch for any HEPA filter, not just Nuwave’s.\nStill, a 100% particle collection rate is noteworthy! But I am sure they rounded numbers. Likely, it was something like 99.9999%.\nNothing is 100% in nature.\nThe best thing about the Nuwave OxyPure is literally the filtration system. You get multiple filter stacked on top of each other. And most filters are washable!\nOxyPure Ozone Removal: Unique among air purifiers “The CARB-Certified OxyPure®\u0026rsquo;s Ozone filter drops the ozone concentration in your home to 1ppb, 70 times lower than current EPA limits”\nOzone removal tests were performed by Intertek Labs. Nice!\nTested in the USA. That’s a good sign.\nSince ozone has a direct effect on health, reducing exposure to the harmful gas is very good for you!\nThe Nuwave OxyPure is the only air purifier (I know) that drops ozone levels. Regular HEPA-filter air purifiers don’t collect ozone.\nSome air purifiers, such as ionic purifiers or (as the name suggests), ozone generators, even increase ozone concentration.\nThe Nuwave OxyPure really stands out with its ozone filter!\nGenerous Filter Supply: 4 Filters for free When you buy a Nuwave OxyPure air purifier, you don’t get just 1 HEPA filter pre-installed into the air purifier.\nYou get 4 extra replacement filters for free!\nI love that!\nSince HEPA filters last only 6-12 months, it’s always annoying to have to shop for replacement filters so soon after getting an air purifier.\nWith the replacement filters included you can run your Nuwave OxyPure for 2 to 4 years with the included filters alone!\nThis shows care for the customer. Other air purifier brands, such as Coway or Dyson, really take profit from the replacement filter market.\nIdeal airflow: Air intakes close to the floor Instead of looking only at what Nuwave themselves already state about their OxyPure air purifier, I also like to also do my own little investigation.\nOne thing that sticks out the me is the air intake location.\nThe air intake is a band of slits along the bottom part of the air purifier’s body. That’s good!\nSince the Nuwave OxyPure’s air intake is close to the ground, it can create a draft of air along the floor and pick up particles from the floor more easily.\nAuto \u0026amp; Turbo mode Many air purifiers, even at lower price tags have this, but it’s a noteworthy feature:\nThe Nuwave OxyPure has an auto mode at which it monitors indoor air pollution levels. Accordingly, to keep air pollution down, it sets the fan speed.\nThis feature allows you to run your Nuwave OxyPure air purifier 24/7.\nYou get a very nice monitoring \u0026amp; control panel with the Nuwave OxyPure!\nThe Cons: Where the Nuwave OxyPure Falls Short Air Quality Indicators: Misleading names \u0026amp; too few metrics Nuwave advertises that the Nuwave OxyPure has two built-in air quality sensors. One measures “Air quality” the other measures “Odor” levels.\nI am really curious about what the odor sensor actually is. Because it is definitely not an odor sensor.\nAfter all, how can a machine judge odors? It would need to sense different molecules and know which ones humans perceive as odors.\nProbably the “Odor” sensor senses volatile organic compounds or some other gases.\nAnd the sensor called “Air” probably measures the amount of particles down to 2.5 microns.\nBut it is an enigma why Nuwave doesn’t name their sensor accordingly.\nThey could have just named them PM2.5 (a common name for 2.5-micron particle sensors) and VOCs (a common name for volatile organic gases), instead of “Air” and “Odor”.\nAdditionally, they emphasize that most other air purifiers have only one air quality monitoring sensor. Which is true.\nBut not at this price range.\nFor comparison, Dyson air purifiers, which cost roughly the same as the Nuwave OxyPure, have a whole set of air quality sensors:\npollen and dust levels (PM 10) smoke, bacteria, and allergen levels (PM 2.5) nitrogen dioxide levels (NO2) volatile organic compound gas levels ( VOC) Dyson air purifiers come with 2 particulate and 2 gas sensors!\nSo, the lack of detailed monitoring is a shortcoming of the Nuwave OxyPure.\nThis obviously does not impact how well the Nuwave OxyPure purifies the air. But if I pay $500 for an air purifier, it surely should monitor better.\nToo Few Air Intakes: More is always better Now let’s talk about the design of the air intake.\nIn top-tier air purifiers, like the ones from Dyson or Coway, you’ll typically see a large number of intake holes around the unit.\nThis design increases the surface area for air to flow through, effectively speeding up the purification process.\nIn the Nuwave OxyPure, the air intake is limited to a band of slits located near the bottom of the device.\nWhile the low positioning is good for catching floor-level particles, the limited number of slits could potentially slow down the purification process.\nIt may not be a deal-breaker, but it’s an area where the Nuwave OxyPure could be better, especially considering its price point.\nCompare it with the Coway Airmega 400 (click here to view it on amazon):\nFor comparison: The Coway Airmega 400 has much more air inlet holes!\nWeight Here’s something I really don’t get. The Nuwave OxyPure weighs in at almost 27 pounds. Why? I mean, we’re talking about a fan with filters.\nLuckily, the Nuwave OxyPure comes with four wheels for better portability, but I’ve got to be honest\nAn air purifier really shouldn’t need wheels to begin with.\nThere is nothing inherently heavy about the components of a high-quality air purifier, and if other brands can keep the weight down, Nuwave should consider doing the same.\nShould You Buy the Nuwave OxyPure? Here’s the deal: If you’re looking for an air purifier with superb filtration and a unique ozone filter, the Nuwave OxyPure is an excellent choice. The additional filters you get when buying it certainly make it cost-effective in the long term.\nI recommend getting the Nuwave OxyPure air purifier here (click to view it on amazon).\nHowever, if monitoring a broad range of air quality metrics is important to you, and if you value a more portable and efficient design, then you might be better off with another model, especially if you’re willing to pay around $500.\nDyson models, for instance, offer a more comprehensive array of sensors and are generally lighter.\nConclusion The Nuwave OxyPure stands strong in terms of air purification, ozone reduction, and long-term cost-effectiveness with its extra filters.\nIt’s certainly no slouch in doing what it’s designed to do: purify the air in your home.\nBut it doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Its sensor system could definitely be more detailed, and it could benefit from a design overhaul focused on increased air intakes and reduced weight.\nSo, is it the right air purifier for you? That depends on what you prioritize. If you’re looking for top-notch air purification and can overlook the minor flaws, go ahead and make the purchase.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/nuwave-oxypure-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe Nuwave OxyPure is one of the best-selling large air purifiers online.

I found out yesterday, after writing about whether Dyson air purifiers are worth the money.\nNormally, as an HVAC blogger and electrical engineer, I get to know all new products on the market quickly. But the Big+Quiet entered the stage, as its name suggests, quietly.\nI guess the biggest reason is the price. At $1,000, the Dyson Big+Quiet is a luxury product.\nWhen you google the \u0026ldquo;Dyson Big+Quiet\u0026rdquo;, all you get is a wall of sales copy-type blog posts with no investigation beyond surface-level data and no questioning of marketing statements at all.\nAffiliate commissions for websites recommending products are around 4%. Accordingly, every Dyson Big+Quiet referral nets $40 (!) of profit.\nSo, everybody is just trying to sell you this thing.\nI am sick of it. Here\u0026rsquo;s a real review:\nIn this post, we’re going to check the Dyson Big+Quiet from all angles.\nWhat’s unique about the Dyson Big+Quiet? How does it compare to competing air purifier brands? How does it compare to other Dyson air purifiers? And, most importantly, is it worth its money? So, let’s have a look!\nWhat’s unique about the Dyson Big+Quiet? Sensor-suite with real-time air pollution reports A set of sensors inside the Dyson Big+Quiet monitors pollution levels in real time and crunches the data into an air quality report which you can view on the LCD screen or in the MyDyson™ app.\nDyson emphasizes the algorithm that calculates the air quality index is unique. To me as an engineer, this sounds funny, because as soon as you work with a set of specific sensor models (which nobody else uses), you have to use a unique algorithm - by definition.\nWhat I like: The formaldehyde sensor is solid-state, meaning it lasts forever.\nThat’s great!\nDetects and Destroys Formaldehyde Another feature that works for a lifetime is the catalytic filter the Dyson Big+Quiet uses to break down formaldehyde molecules.\nThe catalytic filter continuously traps and breaks down formaldehyde molecules into water and CO₂ and never needs replacing.\nThis is particularly useful for those concerned with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in their living spaces.\nBut how is that possible? Why does that filter not need replacement?\nThe key word here is “catalytic”. Catalysts are materials that can increase the likelihood of a chemical reaction through their mere presence. In a chemist’s terms, they lower the activation energy of a reaction.\nThe catalyst, however, does not participate in the reaction. So, it doesn’t wear down and lasts forever.\nI like that.\nBig+Quiet LCD screen: The air quality index indicates air quality over time. In the image, you can see the air quality improving over time!\nDyson Cone Shape: Adjustable Airflow Angles One of the most peculiar features of the Dyson Big+Quiet is the cone-shaped head sitting on the air purifier’s body.\nLargely, that is a design thing.\nTechnically, Dyson made use of it, however, by integrating adjustable airflow angles.\nYou get the option to adjust the angle of airflow at 0°, 25°, or 50°, and there’s also a Breeze mode to mimic natural air circulation.\nWhile this is indeed a unique feature of the Dyson Big+Quiet, it is unique for a reason:\nThe airflow angle does not matter at all for air purification.\nIt might help improve airflow across a room. But largely, it is a totally unnecessary feature.\nDyson advertises that this allows you to run the Big+Quiet standing in a corner.\nThis is only partially true: What really matters for air purification is passing air through the filters.\nSo, it doesn’t matter at which angle the air leaves the cone top, it matters how much air passes through your air purifier filter in a given time.\nThe adjustable airflow angles don’t help with this at all.\nNow, a Dyson salesman would argue that the angled airflow helps pick up particles from distant corners.\nBut the truth is:\nIn a lively room where you walk around occasionally and which you vent occasionally, there is already enough natural airflow.\nThere’s no need for adjustable airflow angles.\nWhere the Dyson Big+Quiet Falls Short Useless feature: Dyson Big+Quiet Cone Aerodynamics In a previous section, we already discussed the adjustable airflow angles and the cone on top from an air purification standpoint.\nBut, it gets even worse.\nDyson markets their Big+Quiet air purifier somehow like a fan:\nThe device is designed for large spaces and uses “cone aerodynamics” to provide long-range projection and circulation of purified air throughout the room.\nThe term “cone aerodynamics” is obviously just marketing.\nAnd again:\nFor an air purifier, it does not matter how the air comes out of it. What really matters is how well air can pass through the filter.\nAfter all, you want an air purifier and not a fan.\nSo, I don’t get why Dyson advertises “cone aerodynamics”. Surely, it’s just to add more content to the sales page and justify the $1,000 price tag.\nLoudness: The Dyson Big+Quiet is not quiet Dyson says the Big+Quiet air purifier offers quiet operation even at full power, recording just 56dBA of sound power, making it suitable for noise-sensitive environments like bedrooms or studies.\nSounds good, right?\nWell…\nIt sounds good until you compare it with the competition. The Levoit Core 300 (my favorite air purifier), for example, runs at just 24dB at the lowest setting up to 50dB at the highest.\nNow you might argue that the difference is only 6dB. However, measured in dB, a 3dB increase is a doubling of sound power.\nThis means, with the 6dB difference, the Dyson Big+Quiet is four times as loud as a regular air purifier (given we look at sound power only).\nTo be fair, the human ear does not perceive 6dB as four times as loud. We perceive loudness non-linearly as well. A rule of thumb is that 10dB doubles perceived loudness. So, realistically, you will perceive the Dyson Big+Quiet as about 60% louder than a regular air purifier.\nHeck, I even reviewed quieter air conditioners (which are 47dB to 52dB at their lowest settings) .\nA good overall noise estimate is the following:\nA Dyson Big+Quiet at the highest setting is as loud as an air conditioner on the lowest setting.\nHEPA 13 Filter: The standard filter every other air purifier has The Big+Quiet comes with a three-phase purification system that captures 99.97% of fine particles as small as 0.1 microns.\nSounds good, right?\nUntil you find out that HEPA 13 is the de-facto standard filter that even low-end air purifiers have.\nFor $1,000 I’d seriously expect something even better.\nAdmittedly, Dyson supplies the standard HEPA 13 filter with the formaldehyde-destroying catalyst we discussed earlier, which is a good thing.\nBut advertising the HEPA 13 filter specifically is a bummer, Dyson.\nIt would be more of a spectacle if your filter did not fulfill the HEPA 13 standard.\nAnd here is one of the key learnings from this article:\nA Dyson Big+Quiet doesn’t purify air more thoroughly than any other air purifier, since they use the same filters.\n( Ignoring the formaldehyde-decomposing catalyst for a moment )\nHow does it compare to other air purifier brands? Overall, the only really unique feature I noticed in the Dyson Big+Quiet is the formaldehyde-destroying catalyst filter.\nAnd you only really need that filter if you are overly exposed to formaldehyde… which only few people are.\nSo, there is not much special to say about the Dyson Big+Quiet.\nQuite frankly, the Dyson Big+Quiet offers the same features as other air purifiers, but at a much higher price.\nLet’s have a look at this Coway Airmega 400 air purifier(click here to view it on amazon). At half the cost of a Dyson Big+Quiet, which is still quite high for an air purifier, this Coway air purifier is probably Dyson’s most worthy competitor.\nJust like the Dyson, the Coway air purifier has everything you’d ever wish for in an air purifier:\nCombined HEPA and activated carbon filter Automatic operation Air quality monitoring You can get all these features even cheaper with this Levoit Core 300S air purifier (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt also comes with the same filter, auto mode, and air quality monitoring (although only for particles larger than 2.5 microns - here, both Coway and Dyson are better).\nSince it’s a smaller air purifier, it can’t cover the same room size as the larger Coway Airmega or the Dyson Big+Quiet.\nOverall, the Dyson Big+Quiet is technically superior to regular-sized air purifiers. But within the premium segment, they prove overly expensive when compared to equally performing air purifiers from Coway.\nHow does the Dyson Big+Quiet compare to other Dyson air purifiers? (Pure Cool, Hot+Cool) Dyson has a variety of models, including the Pure Cool and the Hot+Cool series. How does the Big+Quiet stack up against these?\nHow does the Dyson Big+Quiet compare to the Hot+Cool and Pure Cool air purifier fans?\nBig+Quiet covers more area Firstly, the Big+Quiet is designed for larger spaces. The Pure Cool and Hot+Cool are aimed more at medium-sized rooms. So, if you’re looking to cover more square footage, the Big+Quiet offers that advantage.\nBig+Quiet can filter formaldehyde The Big+Quiet’s key standout feature is its formaldehyde-destroying catalytic filter. Neither the Pure Cool nor the Hot+Cool have this specialized formaldehyde filter. If you are concerned about this particular VOC, then the Big+Quiet is the obvious choice.\nOnly the Hot+Cool series can heat One edge the Hot+Cool has over the Big+Quiet is its heating capability, which is absent in both the Big+Quiet and the Pure Cool. If you’re looking for an all-in-one climate control solution, the Hot+Cool may be more to your taste.\nThe Big+Quiet is more pricey When it comes to price, both the Pure Cool and Hot+Cool come at a cheaper price point than the Big+Quiet. The question then becomes, are the Big+Quiet’s additional features worth the extra money?\nIs the Dyson Big+Quiet worth it? Now, the million-dollar—or rather, thousand-dollar—question. Is the Dyson Big+Quiet worth its steep price?\nIf you’re someone who is specifically worried about formaldehyde in your living space, the Big+Quiet offers unique value. The solid-state sensor and the catalytic filter that never needs replacing can justify the higher cost over time.\nHowever, if you don’t have these specific needs, I would argue that it’s difficult to justify the expense. The Big+Quiet doesn’t clean the air any more effectively than other air purifiers with HEPA 13 filters.\nAnd when you consider the lack of necessity for the cone aerodynamics and adjustable airflow angles, along with its sub-par noise level, it’s hard to recommend the Big+Quiet to the general user - especially when competing brands offer similar specs for much less money.\nThat said, if money is no object, you’re concerned about formaldehyde, and you’re taken with Dyson’s design aesthetics, you may find the Big+Quiet to be a suitable investment.\nBut if you’re a budget-conscious consumer looking for value for money, you may be better served by exploring alternatives from other reputable brands like Coway or even other models within Dyson’s own range.\nSo, to sum up: the Dyson Big+Quiet is technically impressive, but you’ll need to weigh its unique features against its high cost to decide if it’s the right fit for you.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/dyson-big-quiet-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDyson recently launched the Big+Quiet air purifier.

Recently, Dyson launched its new product line, the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet, which costs just around $1,000.\nThat’s a huge price for an air purifier.\nSo, what’s so special about this thing?\nConsidering that Dyson has been selling air purifiers for ages, as features built into the Pure Cool and Hot+Cool models, are Dyson air purifiers worth the money?\nHi, my name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer. One of my favorite free time activities is to uncover marketing myths and publish them on this website. One of my most popular articles is about the alleged better energy efficiency of Dyson heaters, which turned out to be a huge marketing lie.\nToday, we’re going to check in-depth how Dyson air purifiers compare to regular air purifiers. And I sincerely hope that Dyson air purifiers are better, given their cost of $400 - $1,000.\nIn which ways do Dyson air purifiers excel, if any?\nQuick answer: Yes, Dyson air purifiers are worth the money for their detailed air quality monitoring features. On top of that, Dyson air purifiers look great. The Pure Cool and Hot+Cool models also have built-in fan and heating features. If you are looking for air purification only, a regular air purifier from Levoit or Coway is enough.\nThe major difference: Dyson air purifiers are (usually) multi-purpose The biggest difference between Dyson air purifiers and regular air purifiers is that Dyson air purifiers are hybrid devices.\nMost Dyson purifiers, except the Dyson Purifier Big+Quiet, is an air purifier only. Usually, the air purifiers are also fans. In fact, if I ask a random person on the street which products Dyson manufactures, I’d expect them to answer “fans”.\nThese Dyson fans are called Dyson Pure Cool or Dyson Purifier Cool.\nIf you spend more money on a Dyson fan, you also get a built-in heating function. These are called Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool.\nOne of Dyson’s most popular products, the Dyson Purifier Cool™ TP07 (click here to view it on amazon), is both an air purifier and a fan.\nThe Dyson Hot + Cool HP07 (click here to view it on amazon) is an air purifier, a fan, and a heater.\nI haven’t seen this all-in-one concept in any other major air purifier brand.\nDyson Hot+Cool fans with built-in air purification.\nPower usage: Dyson air purifiers consume more due to increased airflow resistance Having up to three products (air purifier, fan \u0026amp; heater) merged into one is great for marketing, but not so great for energy efficiency.\nThe Dyson TP07 air purifier and fan, for example, consumes the same wattage as other air purifiers, but arguably, it filters less air within the same time, simply because a Dyson purifier’s airways are very narrow.\nDyson, for example, advertises that their fans blow out air fast. To achieve that, they have to force the air through narrow slits. Dyson calls this “air multiplier technology”.\nFor a fan, that’s a great feature, because it indeed speeds up airflow. However, if you only want to purify air, that’s a drawback.\nThe narrow slits which Dyson air purifiers force air through increase air path resistance, which ends up increasing your electricity bill and decreasing the particle collection rate.\nAdditionally, air only enters through a comparably narrow band of air inlet holes at the base of the Dyson air purifier.\nA real air purifier has as large and open as possible air inlets to reduce airflow resistance as much as possible.\nDyson forces air through the thin loop amplifier. For a fan, that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing. For air purification, however, it is technically an inefficiency.\nFilter size: Comparison between a Dyson and a pure air purifier One example of a good air purifier is the Coway Airmega 400 air purifier(click here to view it on amazon).\nIt’s one of the rather premium air purifiers. I find Coway air purifiers very expensive (just like Dyson fans), but they are a great example for comparison in this case.\nAir can flow into it from all sides, and, in comparison with a Dyson air purifier, the HEPA filters are much larger. They are 14.37 × 11.02 inches!\nThat’s what a real air purifier should be like.\nFor comparison, the filter of a Dyson Pure Cool Link tower fan is 7.7 × 7.7 inches (height × diameter). So, a Dyson filter is just about 51% of the size of the total filter size used in a Coway air purifier (Coway uses two filters per device).\nThis is the Coway Airmega 400. It has much larger air intakes than any Dyson air purifier!\nSo, physically, it is impossible for a Dyson air purifier to compete with a pure air purifier in the same price range.\nThe easier air flows into an air purifier, the easier it is to pick up light particles suspended in the air.\nDon’t understand me wrong. Dyson air purifiers work just fine. However, the idea of merging a fan and an air purifier into one product has its drawbacks. You don’t get an ideal purifier.\nFilter replacement frequency: Do Dyson air purifier filters last longer? Dyson recommends replacing filters every 12 months. However, there have been experiments that show that a HEPA filter’s particle collection efficiency decreases by 50% after just 6 months.\nIf purification is important for you, you should replace air filters every 6 months, regardless of what Dyson says.\nI feel like Dyson recommends replacement every 12 months to not scare away customers.\nIn a note hidden within Dyson’s air filter information page, they admit that replacement should be every 6-12 months.\nAnd in polluted areas, replacement should be more frequent.\nIn the previous section, I compared Dyson’s total filter area with that of a Coway air purifier. Admittedly, Coway air purifiers tend to be larger devices. But their size offers one major advantage: Large filters have a much higher capacity to hold particles, so they last longer and get clogged slower.\nDyson’s filter area is comparable to that of a regular air purifier at the $100 price point. So, Dyson filters clog just as quickly.\nSo:\nDyson air purifiers need filter replacements as frequently as any other air purifier. Dyson air purifier filters do not last longer. Dyson’s filters are not special.\nFilter material: Are Dyson filters better than other HEPA filters? Dyson says their filters are made of “borosilicate microfibers”. That’s the same material used in many other HEPA filters.\nSo, especially when it comes to filtering the air, Dyson Pure and Dyson Hot+Cool fans are no better than any regular air purifier.\nEven the contrary is true:\nMy favorite air purifier, the Levoit Core 300 (click to read my review) comes with basically the same two-stage air filters (HEPA + activated carbon).\nActivated carbon is the filter material that absorbs odors from the air.\nDyson air purifier filters are the exact same filters found in many other air purifiers. While they filter particles and odors well, you can get the same air purification effect from a much cheaper regular air purifier.\nEven my cheap Levoit Core 300 air purifier has a two-stage filter. The outer layer is HEPA, and the inner layer is activated carbon.\nWhat’s really nice: Dyson Air Purifier features that beat the competition After all that criticism, let’s have a look at what Dyson air purifiers do better than other air purifiers.\nOne thing stands out to me:\nDyson air purifiers provide a much better user experience than regular air purifiers.\nDetailed Air Quality Monitoring Dyson Pure Cool air purifiers have a built-in LCD display that shows you real-time air quality measurements.\nYou get measurements for:\noverall air quality (via the Indoor Air Quality Index display) pollen and dust levels (via the Particulate matter PM 10 display) smoke, bacteria, and allergen levels (via the Particulate matter PM 2.5 display) nitrogen dioxide levels (via the NO2 display) volatile organic compound gas levels (via the VOCs display) With a Dyson Purifier model, you always know about your room’s indoor air quality.\nMany regular air purifiers don’t provide air quality monitoring at all. And those that do, are usually more expensive.\nI have seen some air purifiers (such as the larger Levoit Core models) around the $200 mark which come with built-in particle sensors (PM 10 and PM 2.5), but I haven’t seen any air purifiers with built-in gas sensors.\nWith its detailed air quality monitoring, Dyson beats even the premium air purifier brands such as Coway and Levoit.\nThe green line indicates great air quality. When air quality decreases, the line moves upward toward the orange and red segments.\nFilter life display: Minimizes filter replacement cost Almost all air purifiers have a display, or an indicator light, indicating when to change filters.\nDyson air purifiers take a slightly different approach:\nDyson filters are composed of two stages, an outer HEPA filter and an inner activated carbon filter.\nA Dyson purifier shows you exactly how much filter life remains for each side of the filter.\nWhich is really nice.\nAfter all, the two filters could have two vastly different lifespans depending on the air composition in your home.\nThis way, you can replace carbon and HEPA filters separately and minimize filter replacement costs.\nYou only replace each filter stage when you need to.\nBackward airflow mode What I really like about Dyson Pure and Dyson Hot+Cool air purifiers and fans is their “backward airflow mode”.\nYou don’t have to run them in fan mode the entire time. When you don’t want your Dyson fan to blow air into the room, you can turn on “backward airflow mode”.\nWith the press of a button, your Dyson air purification fan inverses air flow direction (using a special air valve) and blows out air through the back of the device.\nThis feature is unique to Dyson fans.\nAnd it shows that although Dyson builds a hybrid product (air purifier, fan and heater), they really care about the user experience of the individual features.\nRegular air purifiers can only blow air in one direction. Oftentimes they blow air upwards, toward the ceiling.\nSo, naturally, they don’t disturb you. Regular air purifiers can also run on very low fan speeds. So low that you can’t really hear them.\nA Dyson air purification fan in backward mode tries to mimic this real air purifier behavior.\nI like that.\nDesign: Dyson air purifiers look great Of course, one of Dyson’s number 1 selling points is their design. And they really do look great.\nMuch better, in fact, than many other regular air purifiers.\nIt’s hard to say for me as an engineer, but Dyson air purifiers are a status symbol.\nThey are fun to talk about when someone visits your home and asks about the features.\nAnd they blend in well in most rooms.\nI believe that more people buy Dyson fans because of their design than their actual technical features.\nWhich is not, per se, a wrong thing to do. But design can mislead you.\nIn a Dyson fan, the design does not mislead you.\nDyson fans deliver. They are great products. Although, admittedly, their price is relatively high.\nBut if you use them for a long time, they may be well worth it.\nDyson fans just look great.\nRecommended Dyson Pure models My personal favorite Dyson Purifier model is the Dyson Pure Cool TP07 (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt comes with all the features we discussed in this article, and it looks great.\nIf you want a Dyson purifier that can also heat I recommend getting the Dyson Pure Hot+Cool HP07 (click here to view it on amazon).\nConclusion: Are Dyson Air Purifiers Worth the Money? If you want a high-end, stylish device that can serve as a fan, heater, and air purifier, Dyson is a good pick.\nTheir extra features like real-time air quality monitoring are cool but come at a high cost.\nFor just air purification, they\u0026rsquo;re not the best value for money.\nYou pay a premium for the brand and design.\nBut if those things matter to you, go for it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-dyson-air-purifiers-worth-the-money/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre Dyson air purifiers worth the money?

They even have an entire savings page dedicated to how much you can save if you use a Vornado heater.\nIn this article, we’re going to check Vornado heater energy efficiency and how much you can really save with a Vornado heater.\nHi, I am Daniel, an electrical engineer. And I’ve been debunking heating myths on this website for 4 years. So, let’s take a deep dive.\nQuick answer: Yes, Vornado heaters are energy efficient. While they are technically equally as efficient as any other space heater, it is possible that you perceive more warmth due to the focused stream of hot air.\nLater, I’ll also tell you which Vornado heaters I recommend. So, stick out!\nAre Vornado heaters more energy efficient than other space heaters? Investigating energy efficiency in space heaters is always tricky because technically, any space heater is 100% efficient.\nThe reason is that all energy is eventually converted to heat.\nEnergy efficiency, by definition, is\nenergy efficiency = useful energy ÷ input energy\nBecause, as we’ve just seen, all energy eventually ends up as heat, useful energy, and input energy always have the exact same value in a space heater.\nSo, every space heater is technically 100% efficient.\nWhich renders a comparison between different models pointless. After all, all space heaters have the same efficiency metrics.\nVornado heaters use the same amount of energy as any other space heater. You can achieve the same energy savings with any space heater .\nPerceived energy efficiency: Vornado heaters use a vortex stream to focus heat From everyday experience, we all know that different heaters feel different. Some produce whole-room heat, such as oil-filled radiators. Other heaters produce a focused beam of heat such as infrared heaters.\nEven though all of these different heaters have the exact same energy efficiency, they feel different.\nSo, what really matters in a space heater is not how much heat it outputs vs. how much it consumes (which reflects classical technical energy efficiency), but how it distributes heat in a room.\nPerceived energy efficiency measures how well a heater heats you.\nVornado heaters produce a stream of hot air across the room. They heat the whole room, but within the vortex stream temperature is elevated.\nVornado heaters create a vortex that blows air throughout the entire room.\nVornado heaters are both able to\nheat whole rooms and focus the heat in any direction you want Even though they work purely based on convection (the distribution of hot air), I’d say a Vornado heater is more similar to an infrared heater (which is very efficient due to its focused heat distribution).\nBut instead of beaming hot infrared rays through a room, Vornado heaters blow a stream of hot air into the room.\nIn real life, Vornado\u0026rsquo;s vortex does not look like the perfect spiral depicted in the image above, due to obstructions and air movement. But in general, Vornado heaters are able to blow a focused stream of air into the room.\nFor most people, Vornado heat feels more pleasant than infrared heat.\nVornado are the best of both worlds.\nWhat’s the best Vornado heater? I can recommend two Vornado heater models. Let’s have a look:\nSimple \u0026amp; sturdy: The Vornado MVH Vortex Heater This one is my personal favorite:\nThe best Vornado space heater for most people is this Vornado MVH Vortex heater (click to see it on amazon).\nIt’s a very simple space heater with heat and fan speed settings. And that’s what makes it great.\nThe Vornado MVH excels in simplicity: There are no fancy features that stop working. It’s a solid heater that will last you decades. You even get a 5-year guarantee!\nOf course, it also comes with all the safety features you need, including tip-over and overheat protection.\nA great, solid heater.\nHigh-end with remote: The Vornado TAVH10 Another great Vornado heater is this Vornado TAVH10 (click to see it on amazon).\nIn addition to the sturdiness and heating power of the MVH Vortex heater, the Vornado TAVH10 comes with multiple advanced features.\nIt has a built-in thermostat that allows you to control room temperature to a degree’s precision. And additionally, you get a remote control.\nThe LCD screen makes this heater look much more modern.\nWhich Vornado heater would I get? Personally, I like simplicity \u0026amp; sturdiness and I don’t need the advanced features at all. So, I’d get the simpler Vornado MVH Vortex heater.\nBoth heaters produce the exact same amount of heat. So, spending more money does not result in better heating.\nThe Vornado TAVH10 is a great heater, no question. But for most people, the simpler model without all these high-end features is more than enough!\nMy philosophy is: Heating \u0026amp; safety first. Everything else is just a bonus.\nYou can even try the simpler Vornado MVH heater first. And, if you like it and you really miss a remote control and precise thermostat, get the TAVH10.\nFact check: Saving heating expenses with a Vornado heater On their website, Vornado makes some statements about energy savings. Which is very practical since we can fact-check them.\nThe basic idea is correct: Instead of heating the whole house with a central heating system, you can reduce overall temperature by 5°F.\nThen, you can supply heat with a space heater in the rooms you use.\nIn one of my investigative articles, I already did all the calculations: Do space heaters save you money?\nDepending on your house’s size, you can even save up to $400 a year on your heating bill (if you turn down central heating a lot and supply only a little heat with one space heater).\nNow, deduct the cost of running a space heater\nInterestingly, both Vornado and I get very similar results.\nVornado states that you can save $176.09 on your annual heating bill.\nHowever, there’s one fundamental flaw: Vornado assumes that one Vornado heater is enough for a whole house.\nThis is only true if you live alone or if most people are in the same room most of the time.\nMy result (accounting for the true circumstances in a home):\n“Space heaters will only save you money if you reduce your central heating’s temperature by more than 8°F (or 4.4°C) and use 2 or fewer space heaters to supply heat in your home.”\nspace heater money saving guide\nApply this to Vornado heaters:\nYes, you can save money with Vornado heaters if you turn down central heating. With one supplemental Vornado heater you can save $176.09. If you supply heat with two heaters, you’ll save $103.18.\n( Each Vornado heater costs $72.91 per heating season according to Vornado )\nThe more Vornado heaters you run to supply heat, the lower your savings.\nSo, you can only save money using Vornado heaters if you have to supply just one, two or three rooms with heat.\nAfter that, it gets unprofitable.\nWhich heaters are even more efficient than Vornado heaters? Vornado heaters are not the most efficient heaters if you compare them with infrared heaters.\nInfrared heaters radiate heat throughout a room without heating the air. So, they only heat the objects they radiate at.\nWhich is why you can usually run an infrared heater at reduced power and still feel just as hot as when you use a regular convection-based heater such as a Vornado heater.\nFor example, I can run my infrared heater at a 400 Watt power setting and feel the same overall warmth as if I run my other space heaters at ~1000 Watts.\nInfrared heaters really cut down heating costs. Especially when you optimize infrared heater placement (e.g. place them as close as possible to you).\nSo, if you really want to get the most efficient space heater, I recommend getting an infrared heater over a convection-based heater.\nMy recommendation: This Dr. Infrared heater (click to see my review).\nInfrared heaters are even more efficient than Vornado heaters. But their heat is not as comfortable to many people.\nNot everybody likes how infrared heaters feel. They emit hot infrared rays that feel very “dry” (as an engineer I feel ashamed calling radiation “dry”, so sorry my dear colleagues).\nI’d say:\nVornado heaters produce the most comfortable form of heat since they heat the entire room evenly. Infrared heaters produce the most efficient heat because they focus their heat output in one direction.\nConclusion: Are Vornado Heaters Energy Efficient? To summarize, Vornado heaters are as energy efficient as any other space heater in terms of converting electrical input to heat output. This is a characteristic of space heaters in general, as they operate at nearly 100% efficiency.\nWhere Vornado differs is in the distribution of heat. Their vortex technology effectively circulates hot air throughout the room.\nThis leads to a perception of increased efficiency because the heat is more evenly distributed and may feel more comfortable to most users. I call that a “high perceived efficiency”.\nRegarding the potential savings on heating costs, Vornado’s claim of an annual saving of $176.09 is not inaccurate, but it is based on specific conditions.\nThis level of savings is most achievable if you are heating a limited number of rooms with just a single Vornado heater.\nAdditional Vornado heaters used in the home reduce the overall savings.\nIn essence, Vornado heaters provide a balanced blend of reliable heat output and effective heat distribution.\nThey are good quality, reliable heaters and always blast out a nice amount of heat whenever you need it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-vornado-heaters-energy-efficient/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eVornado claims their heaters are energy efficient.

In this article, we’re going to check how well Vornado fans really perform and whether they are worth the money.\nHi, I am Daniel! I am an electrical engineer and I investigate electric devices in-depth.\nI don’t care about the Vornado brand and I am not affiliated with it.\nSo, everything you read in this review is 100% independent information.\nQuick answer: Yes, Vornado fans are worth it. They blow a focused stream of air, optimized for cooling people. Their build quality is superior to most other fans. A Vornado fan can easily last you 10-20 years.\nStick out to the end of this article, where I recommend my two favorite Vornado fan models (a floor fan model \u0026amp; a pedestal fan model).\nBackground: The internet is filled with rigged Vornado reviews I decided to write on this topic because I read a totally biased “expert” review on Vornado fans and how they even replace ACs on reviewed.usatoday.com.\nThe article lacks any technical information. There is no comparison with regular fans. No depth at all.\nIt’s obvious they simply want to sell you the fan. And that’s something I noticed with many Vornado reviews.\nEverybody tries to sell you a Vornado fan. Why?\nThe expert who wrote this top-ranking article studied media production and screenwriting. Wow.\nAnd since he’s ranked #1 (currently), this means Google thinks a screenwriter writing a sales text on Vornado fans is the best source for indoor ventilation advice.\nThat’s impossible.\nAs an engineer, I can stand that fact. Let me do it better! So, let’s have a look. A real look.\nVornado offers tons of different fan models, from floor fans to pedestal fans. We\u0026rsquo;ll check the basic working principles and marketing claims of all of them since they all work exactly the same!\nWhat’s so special about Vornado fans? The number 1 selling point of a Vornado fan is the “vortex” airflow.\nVornado says the following:\n“Vornado\u0026rsquo;s signature Vortex air circulation [moves air] more effectively throughout the entire room.”\nBut what does Vornado mean by “more effectively”? What is air circulation effectiveness in their eyes?\nFrom an engineer’s point of view, airflow effectiveness can be either of the following:\nmore airflow than comparable fans (high technical energy efficiency) better control of direction, a focused airflow (high perceived energy efficiency) Let’s check both of them.\nDo Vornado fans have a stronger airflow than comparable fans? (Technical efficiency) To find out how much airflow Vornado fans provide, we first have to get data.\nAirflow speed \u0026amp; volume is measured in cubic feet (of air) per minute (CFM).\nSurprisingly, Vornado does not provide CFM ratings on amazon. Luckily, they provide the technical specifications on the official Vornado website.\nOtherwise, I’d have something angry to say. I found that brands that advertise “special” features and that cost more than others tend to hide technical specifications (*cough* Dyson \u0026amp; Coway).\nSo, supplying full technical airflow specifications is a good thing!\nVornado apparently really cares.\nSo, let’s use the data to compare Vornado fans with comparable fans.\nVornado’s fiercest competitor is Dreo. If I search for “Vornado fan” on amazon, Dreo fans are the first result. Dreo apparently pays to pop up when someone searches for Vornado.\nVornado and Dreo must hate each other.\nComparable models are the Vornado 660 (click to view it on amazon) and the Dreo CF714S (click to view it on amazon).\nThe Vornado consumes 46 Watts and the Dreo fan consumes 48 Watts of power. So, they are the same class of fans. They even look the same.\nSo, I’d expect similar airflow.\nOn the highest setting, the Vornado fan has an air throughput of 1638 CFM, while the Dreo fan throughputs 1082 CFM.\nAt the same power setting, Vornado throughputs 51% more air than its closest competitor.\nTo be fair, the Dreo fan is a smart fan with smart home integration. So, it spends a part of its power on computation.\nStill, if we look at energy efficiency alone, Vornado fans are indeed good.\nThe vortex airflow a Vornado fan creates. In practice, the airflow is never a perfect vortex (as we\u0026rsquo;ll see later). But the idea is great.\nDo Vornado fans cool better than regular fans? (Perceived efficiency) The perceived efficiency of a fan largely determines how much cooler you actually feel when you run it.\nA fan with a lot of air throughput volume (CFM) is useless if you don’t feel colder.\nHere’s what makes you feel colder when running a fan:\nThe airflow from the fan is very focused, meaning you can point it at you from across the room. The airflow blows away hot air from your skin faster than your body can re-heat the skin These two factors largely determine the cold you feel.In both of these categories, Vornado fans are much better than regular fans:\nVornado fans excel in creating a focused stream of air, which stretches across the room. And the airflow is strong enough to cool you down from a distance.\nRegular fans don’t focus the airflow. Usually, their goal is to move your room’s air as a whole. Which is not what makes you feel particularly cold.\nVornado fans are great for cooling people.\nSo, in comparison to regular fans, Vornado fans are great.\nBut other fan brands such as Dreo and Dyson can also create focused streams of air.\nSo, yes, Vornado fans are better than regular fans. But other premium brands such as Dyson and Dreo cool similarly well.\nVornado’s competition: Do other brands have a vortex airflow? Vornado is not the only brand that advertises a directed airflow. Dreo, Vornado’s closest competitor, for example, calls their airflow technology “Turbosilent X”, which is essentially the same thing as the Vorndao vortex airflow.\nHeck, even an Amazon Basics fan copies Vornado’s design (and therefore its airflow properties), just at a much, much lower quality.\nThe vortex technology is not unique to Vornado and is relatively easy to copy. So, Vornado does not really have an edge over the competition here.\nVortex airflow: Do Vornado fans even create an actual vortex airflow? The “vortex” airflow in Vornado fans is more of a marketing buzzword than a description of the actual airflow.\nThe air doesn\u0026rsquo;t spiral like a tornado within the room, but the Vornado fan does create a high-velocity airflow.\nIn pictures on Vornado’s sales page, the air spirals across the room giving the impression that Vornado fans can create beams of air.\nWhile that is partially true (as there is indeed a strong airflow), the air does not spiral as depicted.\nThere are many factors that can disturb the airflow, including room shape, obstructions like furniture, and other sources of air movement like ventilation systems or open windows.\nEven if one could create a brief spiral flow using specialized equipment, it would likely not be stable for extended periods and would probably not circulate air effectively throughout the room as intended.\nTherefore, while it\u0026rsquo;s theoretically possible to create a spiral of air along a horizontal axis under controlled conditions, doing so in a practical, real-world setting like a room would be quite challenging.\nThe \u0026ldquo;vortex airflow\u0026rdquo; described by Vornado doesn\u0026rsquo;t literally create a stable spiral of air along a horizontal axis; rather, it\u0026rsquo;s designed to create a high-velocity airflow that circulates air effectively throughout the room.\nIs vortex airflow something you should care about? Vortex airflow is nothing that you really need to care about. The point of a fan is to either cool you down directly by carrying away hot layers of air from your skin or to improve general air movement within your room.\nAny regular fan can do that.\nWhile with a vortex airflow, you might be able to reach distant pockets of hot or cold air within your room more easily, it does not make a real noticeable difference to you as a person standing in that room.\nVortex airflow is a nice feature, but usually, you don’t need it.\nCooling power: Do Vornado fans really replace ACs? I’ve seen people claim that their Vornado fan replaced an AC. And, to be honest, I believe that’s true.\nVornado fans create a really strong airflow that covers the whole room.\nIf pure airflow is all you need to cool down, then don’t wait and get your Vornado fan.\nBut, as an engineer, I have to emphasize one thing: In contrast to ACs, Vornado fans can’t reduce room temperature.\nYou can only ever reduce the temperature by extracting heat energy from a room and blowing it out of the window or through some other opening in the wall. That’s what all air conditioners do.\nVornado fans (and all other fans) can’t do that. They can only circulate the air in your room.\nThis can make you feel colder. But it won’t reduce the temperature in your room.\nIf feeling colder is all you need, then go ahead and get your Vornado fan.\nHowever, if you need to reduce room temperature and extract humidity from your room, I recommend getting a portable air conditioner instead.\nSee my article on the most powerful portable air conditioners.\nReliability: Does Vornado build quality fans? Quality matters. Quality is one of my top priorities on this website. If you pay good money for a product, you better get a product that’s worth that money.\nVornado fans are generally built with a combination of plastic and metal components, offering a balance between durability and lightweight design.\nThe plastic used doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel cheap or flimsy, and the metal parts add a layer of robustness to the structure.\nFull-metal designs are not necessarily better in fans. I have a fully made of steel floor fan at home. It’s a great fan, no question. But it’s heavy. Carrying it around actually hurts.\nVornado fans are light enough to carry around easily. But they still feel very solid.\nI like that.\nThe assembly is usually precise, with no gaps or misalignments.\nPerhaps the best indicator of Vornado\u0026rsquo;s confidence in its build quality is the warranty, which often extends for five years or more depending on the model.\nI’ve seen people online saying Vornado fans easily last 10-20 years.\nBuying one good fan and using it for a decade is always better than buying a new fan every two years because fan blades or bearings wear out.\nVornado fans are high-quality products, are solidly built and last you a long time.\nPrice: Are Vornado fans worth the money? A Vornado fan, specifically a Vornado 660, will set you back around $100 as of my last check.\nSome Vornado models, such as the large standing fans even range up to $200. Small room and desk fans are usually around $50.\nIn contrast, the Dreo CF714S, its closest competitor, costs around $80. The Amazon Basics version costs even less at $30. Although the low-quality Amazon Basics fan is possibly the worst comparison for a Vornado fan I could make.\nSo: Sorry Vornado for comparing you with Amazon Basics. But it’s for science\u0026rsquo;s sake. And for the people!\n**BrandModelPriceWattageAirflow (CFM)****Warranty (Years)**Vornado660$10046W1638 CFM5DreoCF714S$8048W1082 CFM1AmazonBasics version$3045W950 CFM1\nWhen we break it down, the Vornado fan costs approximately $0.06 per CFM, while the Dreo fan costs about $0.07 per CFM. The Amazon Basics version costs the least per CFM at $0.05.\nWhile Vornado is more expensive upfront, it delivers higher airflow and comes with a much better warranty, thereby justifying its price.\nMy favorite Vornado floor fan: The Vornado 660 My favorite Vornado floor fan is the Vornado 660 (click here to view it on amazon). Here’s what people say about it:\nAmazon Customer: “This one takes the cake and will blow way more air…It gets the job done. I don’t feel like I wasted money.” K2: “Very Effective Air Circulation! When the fan is on Level 4 it very effectively circulates the air…We’re very happy with this fan and would highly recommend it.” Lifeguard Station: “More powerful than a 20-inch Lasko WindMachine…I was skeptical at first, but it really does work well.” Nicole M: “They really do cool down my 2500 square foot home about 15 degrees if not more…This is not a ‘fan,’ it moves the air around my home.” Steve: “THIS FAN IS A GAME CHANGER! It’s 103° outside right now…74° in my MBR!!! INCREDIBLE!” The Vornado 660 floor fan\nThe Vornado 660 is the best allrounder Vornado fan. It can cool any room, no matter how large it is.\nOkay… there is a limit. It’s probably useless for industrial applications or building sites. But for any regular living space, the Vornado 660 does the job.\nBecause it is compact, it is relatively easy to carry around. So, you can use it in the bedroom, in the living room and in the garage whenever you need to.\nMy favorite Vornado pedestal fan: The Vornado 783 While the Vornado 660 is already a great choice for most people, the Vornado 783 (click here to view it on amazon) does even better in most aspects!\nBecause it is a pedestal fan (the objectively most effective type of fan), it can create a whole-room vortex across your room much better than the Vornado 660, which stands on the floor (where it faces obstructions).\nSo, if a corner in your room is free \u0026amp; you can afford it, I highly recommend getting the Vornado 783.\nHere are some reviews:\nHomewerk: “This fan moves a large volume of air QUIETLY…It’s worth the money.” brandon: “Extremely powerful fan that lives up to its price tag.” Dim: “After a decade plus, had to replace a Vornado fan. This is definitely an upgrade…Would recommend.” Jessi Brown: “Best fans I’ve owned. Sturdy and heavy duty and not too loud.” debra bogard: “I now have 3 of these fans…They’re energy efficient and well worth the price. Thank you VORNADO!” Critical feedback:\nDebra: “For such a big fan you would think it could move some air, but not what was expected.” I have no idea how some people can be astonished by the strong airflow, but then another comes around the corner and says the exact opposite.\nProbably, in that case, the Vornado fan was faulty (which can happen due to transport damages).\nOr the expectations were way too high. Remember, you’re getting a premium fan, not a jet engine!\nStill, as you can see the general impression is very positive. I’d even say people are thrilled \u0026amp; enthusiastic.\nNoise Level: How Loud Are Vornado Fans? Based on my measurements, the Vornado 660 has a noise level of around 52 dB at its highest setting. In comparison, its closest competitor, the Dreo CF714S registers at 50 dB.\nSo, while the Vornado is slightly louder, the difference of 2 dB is hardly noticeable to the average human ear and is well within the acceptable noise level range for residential use.\nEnergy Consumption: Are They Energy Efficient? At 46 watts, running a Vornado fan for an hour would consume 0.046 kWh.\nIf your electricity rate is, let’s say, $0.13 per kWh (which is above average in the US), it would cost you around $0.006 per hour to operate this fan. So, it’s almost free.\nEven over the course of a month, this cost is negligible compared to running a (portable) air conditioner.\nConclusion: So, Are Vornado Fans Worth It?

Space heaters can catch a fire if you use them incorrectly. But will they explode?\nThat’s important because an explosion could stun you and limit your ability to take action.\nHi, I am Daniel, an electrical engineer, and in this article, we’re going to check whether space heaters can explode and the fascinating engineering behind explosion-proof space heaters.\nLuckily, space heaters don’t explode. In fact, it’s impossible for a space heater to explode. Let’s have a look.\nQuick answer: Space heaters can’t explode by design. Explosion always requires pressure buildup that quickly releases. Only oil-filled radiators can build some pressure when the oil heats up. But the pressure is too low to cause an explosion. Other space heaters such as ceramic heaters or infrared heaters can’t explode.\nBut why can’t space heaters explode? They start fires. So why are there no explosions?\nIn addition to answering these questions, I\u0026rsquo;ll also list my recommended explosion-proof space heater at the end of this article!\nWhy space heaters never explode First of all, let’s have a quick look at space heaters that obviously never explode. No question about it:\nElectric heating elements are explosion-proof Simple electric space heaters such as ceramic heaters or coil heaters can’t possibly explode.\nThey produce heat purely by forcing an electric current through a resistive heating element, for example, a ceramic heating element or a metal coil.\nExplosions are impossible in these heaters since an explosion would require an extreme release of energy. Which is not the case here.\nIn these space heaters, no significant amount of energy builds up. Sure, there is a heating element inside which gets quite hot.\nBut what’s the worst thing that can happen to a hot piece of ceramic? Ceramics can withstand temperatures up to 3,600°F (approx. 2,000°C ).\nAlso, ceramic is very temperature shock resistant. So, it won’t crack, even if the space heater heats it to high temperatures instantly.\nThe same is true for coil-based or carbon-based heating elements. All of those are simple electric resistances with physical properties that allow them to withstand high temperatures and high currents and have high shock resistance.\nOil in an oil-filled radiator makes it explosion-proof Oil-filled radiators, on the other hand, not only drive current through a heating element. There is another “layer” of engineering:\nThe heating element is embedded in a fully sealed metal heating body. No oil can ever leave this metal body since it is perfectly sealed.\nI am pointing my laser thermometer at the oil-filled metal body of my oil-filled radiator! Because of the finned design, heat disperses quickly and pressure can\u0026rsquo;t build up inside! Additionally, oil does not boil at these low temperatures, which is why it doesn\u0026rsquo;t build pressure.\nNow that’s where many would expect potential for explosion.\nIf the heating element heats up the oil inside an oil-filled radiator, the oil expands, pressure builds up and the metal body containing the oil explodes.\nBut that’s not how it works!\nIn fact, the oil inside the metal body is used precisely because it does not build significant pressure if you add heat to it.\nIn contrast, if you replace the oil in an oil-filled radiator with water, the radiator will explode!\nOne of the main reasons is the expansion of water with increasing temperature. Water initially expands only slowly.\nThink of a pot of hot water - the water level doesn’t rise noticeably if you heat water from room temperature to 100°C (boiling point).\nBut as soon as water starts boiling, it vaporizes and the amount of space water takes up (in its gas form) explodes!\nOil on the other hand has a much higher boiling point at around 570°F (300°C). And below that boiling point, it does not expand much.\nSince the oil in an oil-filled radiator constantly absorbs heat from the heating element and distributes it into your room, the oil can never overheat and thus never explode.\nOil-filled radiators are the safest space heaters.\nHow temperature control makes space heater explosions impossible (overheat protection \u0026amp; thermostat) Modern space heaters often use a two-point control system for temperature regulation.\nTwo-point control is the simplest form of a thermostat that has both an “on” and an “off” setting at specified temperatures, ensuring that the heater neither overheats nor becomes too cold.\nTwo-point control explained Upper Limit: Once the heater reaches a predetermined maximum temperature, the two-point control system shuts off the heating element, ensuring that the device does not overheat. Lower Limit: If the temperature falls below a certain level, the control system automatically turns the heating element back on to maintain a comfortable environment. Automatic Monitoring: This system constantly monitors the temperature, ensuring it stays within these two points, thereby maintaining a stable and safe temperature range. A thermostat keeps the space heater’s temperature in a safe range.\nSpace heater surface temperatures are safe Space heaters generally operate within a range of temperatures well below what would be required to cause materials like metals or plastics to become unstable or combustible.\nTypically, electric space heaters can get as hot as 150 to 600 degrees Fahrenheit (65 to 315 degrees Celsius), depending on the model and settings.\nThere’s one exception: Infrared heaters can generate much higher surface temperatures of up to 900°F right in front of the heating elements.\nDue to their design, infrared heaters have to expose their heating elements.\nHowever, due to the nature of infrared radiation radiating away from the heater and not heating the air, these temperatures only occur when you place an object right in front of the heater.\nSo, infrared heaters are also safe if you use them correctly.\nInfrared heaters heat up objects right in front of them. So, keep the space in front of an infrared heater free!\nMaterial Safety Flame-Retardant Plastics: Most space heaters with plastic casings use specialized, flame-retardant plastics that are stable at the temperatures generated by the heating elements. Heat-Resistant Inner Components: The inner components that actually generate the heat are usually made of materials that are very good at withstanding high temperatures, such as certain metals or alloys. These are kept well isolated from the external plastic casing. No Explosive Fuel: Electric space heaters don’t contain any form of combustible fuel like propane or gasoline, eliminating the risk of an explosion due to fuel leak or combustion. By using flame-retardant and heat-resistant materials and a simple temperature control like the two-point control, modern space heaters are designed to operate safely within their specified temperature ranges, virtually eliminating the risk of an explosion.\nThere is no place in a space heater where pressure can build up An explosion always follows pressure build-up. But there is no space in a space heater where pressure can build up and cause an explosion.\nSpace heaters are fundamentally different from pressurized containers or systems like gas cylinders, boilers, or certain types of engines where pressure can accumulate.\nIn fact, the exact opposite is true. The fundamental point of a space heater is to distribute heat away from itself. To do that, it must allow airflow exchange.\nA closed space where pressure can build up in a space heater would make absolutely no sense.\nSpace heaters are too simple to explode A space heater is too simple a device to explode. They don’t have chambers that explode. And they don’t contain sensitive parts that suddenly explode.\nI’d even argue that space heaters partly are explosion-proof because they are so simple .\nAfter all, every space heater is just a device that transforms electricity into heat.\nAside from a thermostat and a few safety features, there is nothing inherently complex in a space heater.\nCan any part inside a space heater explode? Capacitors inside a space heater could burst under extreme conditions like high-voltage surges.\nPractically, however, this is unlikely, since testing laboratories only certify space heaters that can withstand voltage surges (as we see later in the article).\nIt’s important to note that a “bursting” capacitor is not a true explosion; it generally results in a popping sound and some smoke, without catastrophic damage.\nImmediately after a capacitor pops, a space heater usually turns off. So, there is no risk inherent to it.\nAdditionally, built-in safety features like fuses and overvoltage protection make such incidents highly unlikely.\nAnd even if such a voltage surge damages your space heater, that’s not the space heater’s fault. Voltage surges come from your neighborhood’s power grid, not from your space heater. And if you get such a surge, likely other devices get damaged as well.\nSo, this is not a risk specific to space heaters.\nHow to reduce the chance of exploding capacitors in a space heater The risk of capacitors bursting in a space heater is already minimal due to built-in safety mechanisms like fuses and overvoltage protection. However, you can further reduce this risk by:\nUsing a surge protector to absorb voltage spikes. Regularly inspecting the space heater for signs of wear and tear, particularly in the electrical cord and plug. Unplugging your space heater when you don’t need it. In summary, while the term “exploding” is technically not accurate for what happens to capacitors under extreme conditions, the risk is minimal and can be further mitigated through proper usage and precautionary measures.\nDo you need to worry about space heater safety?\nDo space heater safety standards check for risk of explosion? Nowadays, space heater manufacturers go through extensive standardized testing. A space heater with a safety certification just sells much better.\nOne of the most widely recognized safety certifications for space heaters in the United States is the UL (Underwriters Laboratories) standard.\nUL Standard tests for explosion safety Here are some of the relevant tests they execute:\nTemperature Test: This test ensures that the space heater operates within a safe temperature range and doesn’t overheat, thereby eliminating the risk of explosion due to overheating. Flammability Test: This test checks that the materials used in the heater, often plastics or metals, are flame-retardant and do not contribute to fire or explosion risks. Dielectric Voltage-Withstand Test: This test is designed to ensure that the space heater can handle potential voltage spikes without breaking down, which could otherwise cause a capacitor to burst (as discussed earlier). Abnormal Operation and Fault Tests: These tests simulate malfunctioning conditions to make sure that the space heater has appropriate safety mechanisms, like thermal cut-offs, that engage to prevent hazards including possible explosions. Safest UL-certified explosion-proof space heater I’ve already written articles on the safest space heaters, so feel free to have a look!\nArticle: What is the safest space heater?\nIn summary:\nThe safest space heater that is also UL-certified is this De’Longhi oil-filled radiator (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt comes with all the safety features you need. And, as an oil-filled radiator, it is safe by design.\nConclusion Space heaters can’t explode. By design, space heaters make explosions impossible.\nThey have no chamber or system where pressure could build up. They are equipped with high-grade materials that can withstand high temperatures, as well as robust temperature control systems to prevent overheating.\nEven components like capacitors, which could theoretically burst, are not explosion risks in the conventional sense.\nFor those still concerned, always look for heaters that are UL-certified, as these have been tested to ensure they operate safely and effectively, even under voltage surges.\nUsing a surge protector can further minimize the already non-existent risk of a space heater explosion.\nStay warm and stay safe!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-space-heaters-explode/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan space heaters explode?

In this article, we’re going to find out which space heaters are engineered, designed, or manufactured in the US.\nInterestingly, the rabbit hole is deep. While many space heater companies started manufacturing in the US, their manufacturing plants often left the country due to globalization.\nQuick answer: There are no space heaters that are 100% made in the USA, but some are engineered, designed, or assembled in the country. Brands like Vornado, Mr. Heater, and Lasko are American. My favorite American space heater is the Dr Infrared DR-968 .\nWhich Space Heater Brands are American? The best American-owned space heater brands are:\nVornado Mr. Heater Dr. Infrared Lasko Let’s have a look at where they manufacture.\nAre they \u0026ldquo;Made in the USA\u0026rdquo;? And if not, where do they manufacture? Let’s have a look at how those space heater companies operate. Where do they manufacture and how do they market their space heaters?\nI am going to pick Dr Infrared as an example for investigation. Any of the other space American space heater brands probably use the same tricks.\nDr Infrared, for example, advertises\n“USA Engineered - Designed \u0026amp; Engineered In USA, Laboratory Tested For Safety”.\nDr Infrared heaters\nSo, based on that sentence alone we learn that the design process is done in the US, while we don’t know anything about the testing and manufacturing locations.\nI found this badge on one of Dr Infrared’s sales pages:\n“Designed \u0026amp; serviced in the USA”-badge from the Dr Infrared sales page with a US flag\nThey really try to force the impression of an American product.\nBut the reality is different.\nI was really stunned by this question someone asked on Amazon:\nQ: Is it made in China?\nA: Supposed to be made in the USA. If I recall, there was a big USA flag on the box.\na question on Dr Infrared on Amazon - answered wrongly\nSo, the psychological manipulation really works… Just because someone put a USA flag on the box doesn’t mean it’s made in there!\nInstead, if you have a close look, the box says “Made in China”.\nI found the same situation with Mr Heater.\nAnd actually, all the remaining brands’ heaters are manufactured in China as well:\nVornado: Though an American company, their space heaters are “Made in China” Mr. Heater: Based in Cleveland, Ohio, but “Made in China” Dr. Infrared: The design is American, but is “Made in China” Lasko: Has manufacturing plants in the U.S., China, and Taiwan. Made in China does not mean bad American brands often meet rigorous quality control and safety standards. However, quality and innovation are not exclusive to American-made products.\nSo, although all of the popular American space heater companies manufacture in China, they don’t automatically produce inferior products.\nManufacturing in China can go very well for a company if they still have good quality control in place.\nFor example, a space heater is objectively good if it fulfills Underwriters Labroratories (UL) testing standards, regardless of where it’s manufactured.\nIt doesn’t matter where a space heater is produced as long as it meets certain quality and safety criteria.\nMany international space heaters earn the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) certification and may also comply with U.S. EPA ENERGY STAR program.\nTherefore, many overseas brands meet or even exceed American testing standards.\nThe backside of my Mr Heater Buddy propane heater where the \u0026ldquo;Made in China\u0026rdquo; label is printed on: Mr Heater Buddy heaters are among the safest propane heaters. As American-branded heaters, they are still manufactured in China.\nWhich overseas brands produce good quality space heaters? There are also several high-quality space heater brands from outside the US. And I don’t mean cheap Southeast Asian brands, but rather well-engineered brands that meet or even exceed American quality.\nThe best overseas space heater brands are:\nDyson (from the UK - produce good, but very expensive heaters) Pelonis(from China - affordable \u0026amp; good quality, I’ve been recommending Pelonis oil-radiators on this website over and over) De\u0026rsquo;Longhi(from Italy - they produce the safest oil-filled radiators) When Can a Company Call a Space Heater “Made in the USA”? According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for a product to be called “Made in USA,” it must be “all or virtually all” made in the United States. This includes not only the final assembly but also the origin of the components.\nSince no company manufactures 100% of the parts in the US, no company can put the “Made in the USA” label on their heaters.\nSome parts, such as wires, gas hoses, and electronics are simply cheaper to mass-produce overseas.\nThis doesn’t make the product any less American.\nIt is just not “Made in the USA” by law.\nSimilarly, if you eat a BigMac anywhere in the world, it’s still an American product. It’s just not made in the USA.\nStill, the idea is American, the quality is American, and it looks American.\nRecommended American Space Heater: Dr. Infrared DR-968 My favorite American space heater is this Dr Infrared DR-968 infrared heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nThe Dr Infrared DR-968 is durable, solid, and well-built. It fulfills the American UL standard and you get customer support with servicing in the US.\nAmerican Engineering This unit is designed and engineered in the USA, adhering to strict quality controls.\nWhile the production is overseas, the design, and quality of this product are all-American. And, of course, all profits go to an American-owned company.\nFulfills the American \u0026amp; Canadian UL safety standard Rest easy, as the DR-968 is listed by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in both the U.S. and Canada.\nIt comes equipped with built-in Overheat and Tip-Over Protection, along with a 12-hour automatic shut-off timer.\nThe UL certification badge.\nBacked by Exceptional Warranty and Support The Dr. Infrared DR-968 doesn’t just come with promises, it comes with an exceptional 3-year limited warranty.\nTo top it off, customer support and servicing are readily available, with a U.S.-based address for your convenience.\nWhere to Buy Earlier I linked the Amazon sales page of the Dr Infrared DR-968. But oftentimes you can get Dr Infrared heaters in hardware stores or even used on US online marketplaces (ebay, craigslist or facebook marketplace).\nConclusion: How American are American Space Heaters? “Made in the USA” is a complicated term in today’s global economy.\nMany brands, like Vornado, Mr. Heater, Dr. Infrared, and Lasko, design \u0026amp; engineer their products in America.\nYet, they leverage international manufacturing to keep production costs down.\nThis does not necessarily compromise quality; it’s a byproduct of the interconnected world we live in.\nThese brands meet American quality and safety standards, often through the UL (Underwriters Laboratories) certification\nTherefore, whether “Made in China” or designed in the U.S., what really matters is the quality, safety, and performance of the product.\nMy top recommendation for an American space heater is the Dr. Infrared DR-968. But all of the companies we checked in this article produce great quality space heaters.\nSo, feel free to get any space heater you like.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-any-space-heaters-made-in-the-usa/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve been looking for a space heater made in the USA for ages.

Most workplaces either prohibit or limit the use of space heaters. And if space heaters are allowed, they have to fit certain size criteria.\nAll these rules can get very annoying.\nSince it\u0026rsquo;s practically impossible to heat an office to a temperature that suits everybody, space heaters can be a practical solution.\nHi! My name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer by profession and I write about space heaters every day!\nIn this post, we will explore the best space heaters for various office setups, including cubicles, open-plan offices, and personal offices.\nFor offices where space heaters aren’t allowed at all, I am going to tell you about my favorite space heater alternative for offices.\nAnd in the end, we’re going to also have a look at how to get your space heater approved!\nSo, let’s have a look:\nWhat are the best space heaters for offices? Offices are very diverse environments with people having different temperature preferences.\nIf you get a too large / too loud or too whatever space heater, someone might complain.\nSo, the decision-driving question is:\nWhich type of office are you working in? Are there other people?\nLet’s have a look at different office setups and which space heaters are best for heating them:\n1. Personal Office (corporate, or at home) The by far simplest situation is a personal office. You don’t have to consider anyone else but you. And, ideally, you are at home or you don’t need anyone’s approval.\nOr, you need someone’s approval in theory but nobody is enforcing rules on you in practice.\nTo heat a personal office any space heater will do.\nHere are my recommendations:\nRecommended infrared space heater for home offices For home offices or for anyone in a high position, where people don’t question you, I highly recommend getting an infrared space heater.\nInfrared heaters provide heat instantly. You don’t have to wait more than a few minutes for an infrared heater to output heat at full capacity.\nMy favorite infrared heaters are Dr Infrared heaters. They are not technically superior to other infrared heaters. But Dr Infrared has a long track of producing quality infrared heaters that are very durable and last you a long time.\nThere’s nothing more annoying than having to buy several space heaters because your initial choice was poor quality. Also, a single space heater is easier to write off as an office expense than multiple space heaters.\nSo, get a good space heater right away.\nMy recommended infrared heater for personal offices is the Dr Infrared DR968 (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis infrared heater comes with a remote (so you can control it from your desk) and is strong enough to heat even large offices.\nDr Infrared also offers a more extravagant model, the Dr Infrared DR998 Elite (click to see it on amazon), which has a built-in fan and humidifier. So, this one can be a good choice in dry areas.\nBut in general, my first recommendation (the first Dr Infrared heater linked) is more than enough for most personal offices!\nRecommended space heater for corporate offices In many corporate offices, bringing a space heater might raise eyebrows among coworkers. Especially, if it’s an infrared heater that glows red.\nTo avoid time-wasting conflict / discussion when someone spots your space heater, I recommend getting a space heater that does not scream “I am glowing red hot and can put Linda from HR’s documents on fire!” like an infrared heater.\nInstead, my recommendation is to get a very safe space heater where you don’t see that it’s heating. You could call it a stealth heater.\nThe safest and most inconspicuous heater is this De’Longhi oil-filled radiator (click here to view it on amazon). It outputs a lot of heat and is very reliable. It does not even make a sound!\nBut this heater is heavy. So, carrying it into the office can be annoying. If possible, you can order it directly to your office.\nA light stealth space heater is this Vornado MVH Vortex heater (click to view it on amazon). However, this one will make some noise because needs the built-in fan to distribute heat.\n2. Cubicles \u0026amp; Open-plan offices In cubicles and open-plan offices, heating can be troublesome. Multiple people share the same room, some feel warm, others feel cold. Everybody has different temperature preferences.\nRecommended space heater for cubicles and open-plan offices For these offices, I recommend getting a smaller-size infrared heater you can place under your desk.\nMy recommendation is this Dr Infrared DR-978 heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis one is a good choice, because it is easy to transport, outputs the same amount of heat as the strong heaters linked earlier (if you run it on the highest setting), and it fits neatly under your desk.\nAnd on top of that, since it’s an infrared heater, you can run it at low power settings and still feel warm instantly.\nYou don’t have to get this specific infrared heater model. Any small infrared heater will do.\nI like the Dr Infrared DR-978 however, because it’s so unsuspicious.\nI have a cheap infrared heater at home that heats just as well at half the price. But it’s much larger and the glowing heating elements will trigger uneducated coworkers who are afraid of heat.\nSo, I’ll never bring it to the office.\n3. Offices where space heaters are prohibited “The only way that I ever got anyplace was by breaking some of the rules”.\nArnold Schwarzenegger\nAnother famous quote from Arnold is “break the rules, but not the law”.\nSo, if you don’t explicitly find a policy you personally signed on space heaters (or power electronics in general), but you heard Steve from IT spreading rumors that you can’t bring space heaters, you can do the following:\nObey the rules and don’t bring a space heater to the office: Recommended alternatives If you are afraid of challenging rules, you shouldn’t bring a space heater. Even so, don’t listen to some random engineer on the internet (me) pushing you toward rule-breaking behavior.\nAfter all, you have to pay your bills, not me.\nIf you are not allowed to bring a space heater, get a heating pad for your chair. Heating pads consume just a fraction of the power a space heater needs (75 Watts instead of 1,500 Watts), are much safer, and don’t violate office policies.\nI recommend getting this heating pad(click here to view it on amazon). But to be honest, heating pads are all equal, and it doesn’t matter which option you go for.\nHeating pads heat through contact (instead of distributing heat “through the air”, where much of it is lost) and, therefore, run on much lower power requirements.\nAlso, with a heating pad you will not heat the entire room. So, you will not disturb anyone’s temperature preferences.\nIt’s the ideal minimal-invasive heating solution for most offices with strict rules.\nIn fact, heating pads consume less power than many laptops. So, if you can plug a laptop into the wall outlet, you can surely plug in a heating pad.\nIf that’s not allowed, your workplace is nuts.\nIgnore the rules and bring a space heater Sometimes ignoring rules is the best way forward. Sometimes space heater prohibition just doesn’t make sense.\nFor example, when your office is relatively new, solidly built, and there are dozens of computers running at the same time (indicating the electric circuitry can withstand high power requirements).\nIn this case, get any of the space heaters recommended earlier.\nStill, I’d say: Run the space heater on low power settings. Keep the space heater to yourself and don’t showcase it. And always turn it off when you leave.\nYou are fully responsible for all damages done.\nRule-proof wearable neck heaters for offices One heater that does not violate any office rules is a wearable neck heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nThese neck heaters are battery-powered and rechargeable. So, you can charge yours at home, heat in the office, and bring it home with you again.\nThis way, it does not count as office equipment and, normally, you don’t need to get approval.\nOn top of that, you don’t even draw electricity from your office, which makes them even safer than heating pads.\nIt’s a wearable just like a watch or a smartphone.\nNobody ever questions these things.\nHow to get your space heater officially approved If your workplace has a policy that strictly regulates the use of space heaters, you’ll need to get approval from the relevant authorities before you can start warming up your personal office space.\nHere are some strategies to help you get your space heater officially approved:\nArguments to give your employer to allow space heater Energy Efficiency: Make the argument that modern space heaters are energy-efficient and can actually save the company money in heating bills, especially if the main heating system is generally cranked up to keep everyone warm (I’ll provide you specific calculations later) Productivity: You perform better in environments where you are comfortable. Being cold is a distraction that can affect productivity, which effectively decreases your employer’s profits. Safety Features: Explain that modern heaters come with safety features like tip-over protection, overheat protection, and timers. Personalized Comfort: Emphasize that a space heater allows for personalized temperature control, meaning the central heating system doesn’t have to work as hard to meet a broad range of temperature preferences. Space Heater Certifications Employers love hearing that your electronic devices have proper safety certifications, for example, one of those (depending on where the heater is manufactured):\nUL (Underwriters Laboratories) CSA (Canadian Standards Association) ETL (Intertek) All the heaters recommended in this article have at least one of these certifications!\nQuote:\n“The Dr Infrared Heater is certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and Canada, ensuring the highest safety standard.”\nDr Infrared Heater sales page\nThe UL certification badge is printed on the packaging of safe \u0026amp; tested space heaters. Also, you can find out on the sales page of a heater whether it has this certification.\n( Except for the space heater alternatives: The neck warmer and the heating pad don’t have special certifications aside from the CE standard certification, since they are both low-power devices )\nSafety Tips for Using a Space Heater in the Office Keep it Away from Flammable Materials: Always make sure the heater is at least 3 feet away from flammable materials like paper, cloth, or furniture.\nI did an experiment on infrared heater ignition capability and found that infrared heaters can ignite plastics that are closer than 1 foot distance from the heating elements. Use on a Flat Surface: Always place your heater on a flat, hard surface to minimize the risk of it tipping over.\nCarpeted floor is fine for space heaters as well. I did an in-depth analysis of space heater heat distribution and different carpet material ignition temperatures before and found that space heaters can’t ignite carpets.\nCertainly, they can’t harm the thinly carpeted floor in a typical office. Never Leave it Unattended: Always turn off your space heater when you leave your workspace.\nSpace heater fires usually start in the absence of people. Leaving your heater running is inconsiderate both for the safety and the electricity bills of your workplace. Regular Inspection: Regularly inspect the heater for any wear and tear, including the power cord. If the power cord looks worn or even gets hot, stop using it immediately. Conclusion Finding the right space heater for your office environment can be challenging but is well worth the effort.\nFrom personal offices to cubicles and open-plan setups, there’s a space heater to fit your needs and preferences.\nIf your office prohibits the use of space heaters, consider alternatives like heating pads or wearable neck heaters, which offer a compromise without violating company policies.\nGetting your space heater approved may require some effort on your part, including presenting a compelling case to your employer.\nSafety should always be your top priority, so make sure to choose a space heater with the appropriate certifications and always adhere to safety guidelines.\nRemember, the key to a comfortable and productive work environment is making it suit you, and a space heater can be a step in that direction.\nDisclaimer: Always consult your workplace’s rules and regulations regarding the use of electrical devices.

Not only does a lot of heat rise to the ceiling and is effectively wasted, but additionally, most space heaters are not very strong.\nIn this article, we’re going to explore how to properly heat rooms with high ceilings with just space heaters.\nThere are two fundamental approaches: Either get a very strong heater or get a heater that effectively distributes heat into your room and away from the ceiling.\nOf course, just one of those approaches is energy-efficient. And one type of heater excels!\nAfter checking out the physics of heating rooms with high ceilings, I am going to recommend you two heaters that are perfect for your situation.\nQuick answer: The best space heaters for rooms with high ceilings are wall-mounted infrared heaters that radiate heat downward into the room (away from the ceiling). These heaters keep heat in the floor area and minimize the heat rising to the ceiling.\nIf that’s already enough of an explanation for you, feel free to skip to the recommendation section!\nFor anyone interested, let’s check the physics of heating rooms with high ceilings.\nThe Two Approaches to Heating Rooms with High Ceilings Everybody knows that hot air always rises while cold air always settles. Ironically, this is exactly the opposite of what we need when heating a room with high ceilings.\nUnfortunately, we can’t change the physics of convection (the movement of hot air).\nSo, based on this fundamental truth, there are two approaches to heating a (large) room with high ceilings:\n1. Full Room Heating with High Power The first approach to heating rooms with high ceilings is to use a strong space heater that outputs a lot of heat.\nIn this case, you simply accept that a lot of heat rises to the ceiling. The only way to counter this effect is through pure force:\nThe more heat your heater outputs, the warmer your room gets overall.\nAdmittedly, this approach probably ensures the most comfort. Your room is evenly heated.\nBut a lot of heat lingers around the ceiling and waits to dissipate through the imperfectly insulated ceiling or through walls. So, all heat that rises to the ceiling is effectively wasted.\nAdditionally, heating the entire room is the most expensive approach to heating. Not only do you pay the electricity cost of your space heater running on full power, but you also pay for heat that you don’t even use…\nHot air lingering around the ceiling is always a waste of money and energy inefficient.\n2. Optimizing Heat Distribution with the Right Heater Type The second approach to heating a room with a high ceiling using a space heater is to control heat distribution.\nIf there is a way to direct the heat and keep it in a part of your room, you can run your space heater at lower power but still feel the same warmth.\nIn rooms with high ceilings, you always want the heat to stay around the floor area (from floor to 8 feet above the ground). That’s the space in which you can feel the heat. Much higher than that and the heat is wasted.\nUnfortunately, heat always rises. So, you can’t physically keep all of the heat down.\nBut luckily, there are still ways to control where the heat goes.\nDifferent heaters distribute heat differently. For example, ceramic heaters, oil-filled radiators, and most other electric space heaters distribute most of their heat using convection, the natural movement of hot air.\nSince hot air always rises, these types of heaters are a poor choice for high-ceiling rooms.\nOn the other hand, infrared heaters use radiation to distribute heat.\nSimilar to a flashlight, they “shine” in just one direction, so you can decide where the heat goes.\nOf course, the heat rays are not as focused as the light rays in a flashlight. The opening angle of infrared heater radiation is around 90°, so it can oftentimes (depending on its placement) cover an entire wall from corner to corner.\nA space heater that can focus heat toward a specific space in a room is ideal in a room with a high ceiling.\nHow infrared heaters work \u0026amp; why they excel in rooms with high ceilings Infrared heaters are perfect for rooms with high ceilings. An infrared heater emits infrared radiation.\nThe infrared rays travel through the air without heating it or interacting with it in any way.\nWhen infrared rays hit an object, the object absorbs them and converts the radiation to heat.\nIt’s the exact same way the sun heats the Earth: Sunrays travel long distances through empty space, pass through the atmosphere and then hit you. And you feel warm.\nThis effect is very noticeable on a mild day in spring, where the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays are warm, but the air is still cold.\nEventually, since infrared heaters heat up all the objects and people in your room, the air also heats up. Infrared heaters turn all the objects in your room into tiny heat radiators.\nThe best thing about infrared heaters is, as we’ve already seen, that you can decide where the heat goes.\nAnd on top of that, infrared heaters heat within a matter of seconds.\nInstead of waiting for your entire room with a high ceiling to heat up (which can take ages in large rooms), infrared heaters heat instantly.\nAnd the key to running an infrared heater efficiently is proper placement.\nProper infrared heater types \u0026amp; placements in rooms with high ceilings In a room with a high ceiling, you generally have three options to place your infrared heater.\nRegular infrared heater radiating along or at floor level: Most portable space heaters stand on the floor. Accordingly, they heat the floor area, usually with a slight upward tilt to heat up \u0026amp; into the room.\nUsually, that’s a good thing. But in rooms with high ceilings, other infrared heater placements are better. Electric infrared patio heater mounted to the ceiling: You can get an electric infrared patio heater (I will recommend one later) that hangs from the ceiling like a lamp.\nThis form of infrared heater is ideal in a room with a high ceiling since it heats the entire room evenly and radiates the heat downward. However, the installation effort can be high, depending on how high your ceiling is. Wall-mounted infrared heaters: Wall-mounted infrared heaters hit the perfect balance point of easy-to-install \u0026amp; radiating heat downwards and into the room. They don’t hit a room as evenly as an infrared patio heater hanging from the ceiling. And certainly, they are not as easy to install as a portable infrared heater standing on the floor. But, I’d say, a wall-mounted infrared heater is the best type of infrared heater for rooms with high ceilings. Recommended Space Heater for Rooms with High Ceilings Here are my favorite infrared heaters for the different mounting options we just checked (wall-mounted, hanging from the ceiling, free-standing).\nWall-mounted infrared heater My first recommendation is this wall-mounted Dr Infrared DR-238 heater (click to view it on amazon).\nI really trust Dr Infrared as a brand. The best thing: They don’t just cycle through products, trying to sell the next best heater over and over.\nThe Dr Infrared DR-238 is a years-old model that is time-tested and that works reliably.\nIt currently has well over 4,000 positive reviews on amazon.\nIt’s the #1 wall-mounted infrared heater. My recommendation for most people!\nDr Infrared DR-238\nHanging infrared heater This is interesting… I could not find a single hanging infrared heater that is as good as the wall-mounted Dr Infrared recommended in the previous section.\nThere are plenty of ceiling-mounted infrared heaters. The only one that’s acceptable is this hanging infrared heater (click to see it on amazon).\nTheir downside is: They usually don’t come with a remote (which makes controlling them very annoying).\nAnd on top of that, people complain that hanging patio heaters only heat the top of the head. Apparently, you shouldn’t heat directly from above, but rather at a slight angle, so that heat is distributed better in your room.\nLet’s pass on hanging patio heaters. They are good in principle, but not in practice.\nRegular infrared heater If you don’t have the skills or tools to mount a wall-mounted infrared heater, I recommend getting this free-standing Dr Infrared infrared heater (click to read my review).\nActually, this infrared heater is my all-time favorite infrared heater in general. I love its wooden case. And it can output a lot of heat.\nFor rooms with high ceilings, wall-mounted infrared heaters are generally still better.\nBut this one will do the job as well!\nConclusion The most important learning from this post is:\nGet an infrared heater.\nWhether you get a wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, or free-standing infrared heater is only slight optimization.\nThe fundamental principle for effectively heating a room with a high ceiling is to let as little heat as possible rise upwards.\nAll infrared heaters accomplish that by radiating the heat exactly where you need it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-space-heaters-for-rooms-with-high-ceilings/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHeating a room with high ceilings with only space heaters can be challenging.

The cold season is approaching and there are plenty of space heater myths and misconceptions that make you stop and hesitate.\nIf space heaters really burn oxygen, maybe you should find another way to heat. Should you?\nLet’s stop the speculation and get right to the core of the matter. Here’s the answer:\nElectric space heaters never burn oxygen, since the source of the heat is not a chemical reaction. Only fuel-burning heaters such as propane heaters or kerosene heaters do burn oxygen. However, due to tiny oxygen inflow streams from outdoors through gaps and creeks, and the built-in oxygen depletion sensor many fuel-burning heaters are absolutely safe to use indoors.\nIn this article, we’ll later also have a look at which models you can safely buy that never burn oxygen.\nAnd, we’ll also look at the safest indoor gas heaters that come equipped with oxygen-depletion sensors to keep you safe.\nWhat causes a space heater to burn oxygen? The air in your room contains many chemical elements, including a large portion of oxygen.\nIn an open room (let’s say with an open window), oxygen levels can never deplete, since the airflow entering your room continuously refills oxygen levels.\nOf course, in the cold season, preferably you keep the window closed. Essentially, you can think of your room as a closed system then.\nIn this closed system, new air can’t enter, and “old” air can’t leave. So, how does oxygen deplete in a closed room?\nCombustion transforms oxygen in a chemical reaction The truth is: Oxygen never “disappears”. You can only transform it by bonding it with other elements.\nOne such transformation is combustion.\nCombustion is a chemical reaction between any substance in your room and oxygen, which produces heat and light.\nThe most familiar combustion processes are regular fires, from wood or candles, which “burn” oxygen during the combustion process.\nIn fact, fire does not burn oxygen, but it merely is an ongoing chemical reaction that bonds oxygen with carbon (from wood or candle wax).\nFires burn on oxygen and deplete oxygen levels.\nDo all forms of heat burn oxygen? Fire burns oxygen, since it’s a chemical reaction. But many other forms of heat don’t burn oxygen.\nIt’s not the heat that burns oxygen. It’s the chemical reaction that is the source of heat that burns oxygen.\nThere are other sources of heat, such as electric, geothermal, solar, etc.\nNone of these forms of heat run on oxygen.\nElectricity creates heat by shaking around atoms in wires. The electricity itself creates heat without consuming oxygen.\nActually, if we look at the entire universe as a whole, heat from chemical reactions is rather rare. Almost all of the heat comes from fusion reactions in stars, or gravity inside planets creating friction and heat. None of these things needs oxygen.\nEven the sun burns without oxygen!\nSo, no, only heaters that run on fuel-burning combustion need oxygen.\nWhich space heaters burn oxygen? Now that we know that only fuel can burn oxygen, we can divide space heaters into two categories:\nElectric space heaters Most household space heaters are electric space heaters. Electric space heaters convert electrical energy to heat.\nThey do that by drawing high electric currents from your wall outlet and forcing them through a heating element.\nThe heating element can be a well-engineered special infrared heating element. Or it can be a simple wire or a piece of ceramic acting as an electric resistance.\nIn any case, as the electric current passes through the heating element, it heats up.\nNo chemical combustion is needed here.\nRecommended indoor-safe space heater The safest space heater that never burns oxygen is this De’Longhi oil-filled radiator (click here to view it on amazon).\nIf you really care about indoor oxygen levels and general space heater safety, definitely get such an oil-filled radiator. They are the safest type of space heaters.\nOil-filled radiators also don’t emit other harmful gases such as carbon monoxide. And due to their large surface area, they are not as hot to touch and can’t ignite things nearby.\n( For comparison: I did an experiment with a small infrared heater - it was able to ignite paper )\nFuel-burning space heaters On the other hand, fuel-burning space heaters such as propane, natural gas, or kerosene heaters burn oxygen.\nBut there is little reason to hesitate using an indoor-certified quality fuel-burning space heater indoors.\nThere are plenty of good fuel-burning space heater brands that manufacture propane or natural gas heaters that meet indoor safety standards and come with several safety features.\nThe most important safety feature is an oxygen depletion sensor that immediately turns off the heater when the air in your room lacks oxygen.\nAlso, they come with overheat protection and tip-over protection.\nSo, even though fuel-burning space heaters do burn oxygen, they are not nearly as dangerous as you think. In fact, because they don’t draw incredibly high currents from your wall outlet, fuel-burning space heaters can even be safer than electric space heaters in older homes!\nHere’s an article about the safest propane heater.\nThere are three space heaters in this picture: A propane heater (which burns oxygen), and an infrared heater and an oil-filled radiator (both of which are electric and therefore don\u0026rsquo;t burn oxygen)\nPut in practice: Using an oxygen-burning propane heater indoors I have a Mr. Heater Buddy propane heater at home which technically burns oxygen. In my living room, I can run it for hours and I don’t notice any change in the room’s air.\nOf course, I don’t notice anything. The human body can’t differentiate between breathing oxygen-rich and oxygen-depleted air.\nLack of oxygen always results in headaches and other bodily symptoms. But the breathing itself is unaffected.\nSo, am I risking my health when running a Mr. Heater Buddy propane heater? No!\nThere have been plenty of experiments measuring oxygen and carbon monoxide levels after running these modern propane heaters for a long time.\nOne I remember in particular is from Taylor Dzaman who locked his Mr Heater Buddy in an RV and ran it overnight.\nThe result:\nA modern indoor propane heater does not deplete oxygen levels or emit carbon monoxide.\nBut why?\nTechnically, it has to burn oxygen in order to burn.\nHowever, practically, no room is perfectly sealed. So, as soon as an indoor propane heater burns oxygen up, it draws in more oxygen from the outside.\nThese tiny air drafts are imperceptible to us humans. But chemically, they stabilize the relative proportion of the constituents of the air in your room.\nMy experience with oxygen depletion sensors The oxygen depletion sensor in a propane heater is a small jet flame that is aimed directly at a thermocouple. A thermocouple is a small thermometer that can withstand high temperatures.\nWhen oxygen levels decrease, the jet flame can’t burn at its ideal temperature anymore. It cools down. The thermocouple notices the cooldown and immediately shuts off the gas valve of the heater.\nThe oxygen depletion sensor is a great piece of engineering. Simple, safe, and reliable.\nIt is impossible for a propane heater to deplete your indoor oxygen levels significantly because the oxygen depletion sensor will automatically shut off the heater before that happens.\nHowever, running my propane heater in my apartment, the oxygen depletion sensor never triggered. Apparently, the oxygen burn rate of propane heaters is very low. And likely, tiny gaps around my windows and below the doors let fresh oxygen enter the room.\nIn practice, you likely never need the oxygen depletion sensor.\nThe absolute safest indoor fuel-burning space heaters Portable propane heaters, although they are very safe (as you’ve just seen), have their shortcomings.\nDue to propane combustion, they increase room humidity (one side-product of propane combustion is water, interestingly). And depending on how well-sealed your living space is, they might still affect oxygen levels, although not dangerously.\nIf you’re worried about that, I highly recommend checking out vented gas heaters.\nThese are regular heaters, but they are vented. So, they have a connection to the outdoors where they can vent all the combustion waste gases.\nVented gas heaters are incredibly safe and can output a lot of heat. The downside is that they are not portable.\nHow to keep oxygen levels up when using a space heater Ventilation: Ensure proper ventilation if using fuel-burning space heaters. This replenishes oxygen and vents out any harmful gases.\nAlso, ventilation gets rid of the humidity your propane heater’s combustion creates. CO Detectors: Always have a working carbon monoxide detector when using fuel-burning space heaters. I recommend this CO detector (click to view it on amazon).\nAlthough modern heaters burn so safely that they won’t produce CO, it’s better to have a CO detector and not need it than to not have one and need it. Conclusion Based on everything we checked, you now know that electric space heaters do not consume or burn oxygen, making them a viable option for most indoor settings.\nHowever, if you are using fuel-burning space heaters, you are indeed dealing with devices that consume oxygen, albeit at a slow rate.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s crucial to understand that this doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically render them dangerous.\nMany modern fuel-burning heaters come equipped with built-in safety features, such as oxygen depletion sensors, to ensure they shut off before oxygen levels drop to concerning levels.\nIf you prioritize indoor safety and oxygen levels, electric heaters, particularly oil-filled radiators, are the safest choice.\nThey not only preserve indoor oxygen but also eliminate the risk of harmful gas emissions like carbon monoxide.\nTo stay safe when using a fuel-based space heater ensure proper ventilation and have a working carbon monoxide detector in place.\nIn conclusion, the debate on whether space heaters burn oxygen can be summarized simply: electric heaters don\u0026rsquo;t burn oxygen while fuel-burning ones do burn oxygen.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/do-space-heaters-burn-oxygen/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDo space heaters burn oxygen?

Or did you lose your Dyson remote control?\nThen, you’re in the right place!\nMy name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer, and I’ve been writing about Dyson products for quite a while.\nThis is a quick guide on how to control a Dyson Hot + Cool without the remote.\nAlso, we’re going to cover how to fix your remote not working, or in case you lost it, how to replace your remote.\nThere are two possible reasons for you having to control your Dyson fan without a remote.\nEither your remote control stopped working. Or you lost it. In any case, the easiest solution is to just get a new Dyson Hot + Cool remote.\nQuick answer: You can control your Dyson Hot + Cool without a remote by pressing and holding the standby button on the device. Your Dyson then cycles through the different temperatures until you release it. Long-term this is time-consuming, so you should get a replacement remote soon.\nThere are 3 things to do when your Dyson Hot + Cool is not working:\nIf you lost your Dyson remote, buy a replacement remote. If your Dyson remote is not working, try replacing the battery. Until the problem is sorted out, control your Dyson without a remote. We’re going to cover all these aspects in this post. So, let’s start with getting a replacement remote control in case you lost your remote:\nReplacing a Lost or Non-Working Remote To control your Dyson Hot + Cool, you don’t need the original remote.\nThe easiest way to control your Dyson Hot + Cool again is to buy a replacement remote.\nOf course, you can control your Dyson Hot + Cool using the button on the device (as explained later in this article), but that’s a hassle to do long-term.\nSo, sooner or later, you will need a replacement remote.\nI recommend getting this replacement remote for all Dyson Hot + Cool heaters (click here to view it on amazon).\nOn the product page, select the right remote control for your Dyson Hot + Cool model.\nOr, alternatively, use the following model-specific links:\nDyson AM04, AM05 Dyson AM06, AM07, AM08 Dyson AM09 Dyson AM11, TP01, TP0 These replacement controls all work without programming or synchronizing with your Dyson heater fan.\nHow to control a Dyson Hot + Cool using the Standby button (without a remote) While you’re waiting for your replacement remote control to arrive, you are limited to turning the heater on and off, and adjusting temperature.\nHere’s how:\nFor each of the following settings, you have to use the standby ON/OFF button on the bottom part of your Dyson fan (below the target temperature display).\nTurn ON: Push the button once. Turn OFF: Push the button again. Adjust the temperature: Press and hold the button. The target temperature cycles from 0°C up to 37°C and then back down.\nSo, to lower the temperature, you have to wait for the target temperature to pass 37°C. Switch to Cooling mode: Press and hold the button until the temperature decreases below 0°C. Release the button once the red indicator light ring around the button turns blue. What you can’t control without a remote Without a remote control, you can’t set fan speed and oscillation.\nTo set airspeed and oscillation, you need either the original Dyson remote or one of the replacement remotes recommended earlier.\nTroubleshooting: How to fix a Dyson remote not working If you still have your Dyson Hot + Cool remote, but it isn’t working, likely something is wrong with it.\nHere are the most common problems with Dyson remotes:\n1. Battery needs replacement The most likely reason for your Dyson remote not working is an empty battery.\nHow to check it: You can verify that your Dyson remote control is empty by pointing the top side (where the signal comes out) at your phone’s camera.\nOpen the camera app and press buttons on the remote. You should see the (normally invisible) infrared light lighting up and blinking if the batteries are full.\nIf you don’t see any signal coming from your Dyson remote, its battery is empty.\nHow to fix it: To fix it, you have to open your Dyson remote, take out the original battery and replace it.\nMake sure to use a properly sized screwdriver to avoid damaging the screw.\nDyson originally uses these Panasonic CR 2032 3V replacement batteries (click to view them on amazon).\n2. Signal emitter blocked The top part of your Dyson remote control contains a “signal emitter”. That’s a component that sends the commands from your remote to your Dyson fan.\nHow to check it: Check the signal emitter and check that it’s clean. For example, someone could have taped over it. Or there might be dirt on it.\nYou can use the smartphone camera test from the previous section to check whether you can see a signal.\nHow to fix it: Ensure that all sides of your Dyson control are clean. Especially the top side, which emits the signal, can’t have any obstructions. You can use glasses cleaning wipes or rubbing alcohol to thoroughly clean your Dyson remote.\n3. Dyson fan broken Another possible reason for your Dyson remote not working is that the Dyson Hot + Cool fan itself is not working.\nHow to check it: Try turning on your Dyson Hot + Cool without the remote using just the Standby button.\nIf it doesn’t turn on by pressing the Standby button, your Dyson heater is broken.\nHow to fix it: Possible reasons for your Dyson heater not working are a powerless wall outlet, a broken extension cord, or clogged filters or air inlet holes.\nHave a look at this article: How to fix a Dyson heater not turning on\n4. Dyson fan not oscillating And yet another potential issue with Dyson fans is when they are not rotating. So, even if you try to set oscillation via the remote control, your fan doesn’t oscillate.\nUnfortunately you can’t set oscillation via the standby button.\nBut if rotation is not working, this does not necessarily mean that your remote isn’t working.\nHow to check it: Check whether your remote can turn the heater on and off. If that works, the problem is not in the remote.\nHow to fix it: Possibly there is tape on the split section or your Dyson fan is not properly assembled. Have a look at this article on how to fix a Dyson heater not rotating.\nConclusion Being without the remote for your Dyson Hot + Cool can be inconvenient, but as we\u0026rsquo;ve outlined, it\u0026rsquo;s not impossible to still control the device.\nThe standby button offers a temporary solution, allowing you to manage the basic functionalities of turning on and off the device and adjusting the temperature.\nHowever, to fully experience all the features of your Dyson Hot + Cool, you need a remote.\nWhether you\u0026rsquo;ve lost your original remote or it has stopped working, replacement options are readily available.\nIt’s straightforward to buy a replacement remote or replacement batteries.\nIf your remote is malfunctioning, common issues such as depleted batteries or blocked signal emitters can often be resolved with simple troubleshooting.\nIn the end, while the standby button is a helpful interim solution, securing a fully functional remote will ensure you get the most out of your Dyson Hot + Cool device.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-use-dyson-hot-cool-without-remote/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDid you end up trying to turn your Dyson heater on, or change temperature settings, but apparently the remote doesn’t react?

Others give off plastic smells.\nIn this article, we’re going to check where your space heater smell comes from, whether it is dangerous, and, of course, how to eliminate the smell.\nMy name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer, who worked in the heat sensing industry. I love solving simple, day-to-day electronic problems. Not the abstract stuff you study at university.\nSo, let’s check your space heater smell together and find out what to do.\nUnderstanding Why Space Heaters Smell There are several reasons for a space heater smelling. Let’s have a look at some of them.\n1. Plastic / Chemical Smell: New heater “burn-in” phase First and foremost, let’s start with a brand-new space heater. New space heaters usually have plastic casings (except some oil-filled radiators).\nAnd even if yours has a wood or metal case, usually it has a protective coating on it.\nThere is always some artificial material on your space heaters.\nPlastic materials and protective coatings contain VOCs (which stands for Volatile Organic Compounds). VOCs are (usually) unhealthy chemicals that evaporate from the plastic at room temperature.\nThe room temperature evaporation explains why these gasses are called “volatile”.\nVOCs are a side-product of plastic production. For example, they are part of new PVC, which is one of the most commonly used plastic materials.\nThese VOCs cause the typical plastic smell. And it takes time for them to outgas.\nThe hotter the plastic gets, the faster it outgasses. This is very practical since we’re dealing with space heaters which naturally get hot.\nSpace heater plastic smell is expected in new space heaters, but not healthy.\nLater on, we’ll check how to get rid of the unhealthy plastic smell fast.\nBut first, let’s have a look at the next smell.\n2. Burning Smell: Dust and debris accumulation If your space heater smells like burning, that’s likely due to dust accumulation on the space heater’s heating elements.\nIt can also smell like burning hair, or other burning smells, depending on the type of debris on the heating elements.\nIn fact, this happened to me just yesterday, where I turned on my infrared heater for the first time in a long while.\nAfter turning the heater on, it smelled like something’s burning. The smell, however, faded within a minute.\nSo:\nDust, hair and other particles settling on your space heater can cause a burning smell. The burning smell, however, has to fade within a short time after turning the heater on.\nCloseup view of my infrared heater: Can you spot the dust that settled on it? All this dust will cause a burning smell.\nIn case the burning smell remains, even after many minutes of running your space heater, you should turn your space heater off.\nSkip to the next section to find out what to do to fix it.\n3. Fishy / Burning / Smoky Smell: Electrical or mechanical issues Any burning smells that are persistent, even after running your space heater for many minutes are very likely due to electrical or mechanical issues.\nThis also includes fishy smells. Some electronic components, especially capacitors, smell fishy when they blow up.\nIf your space heater’s burning smell does not fade within a short time, please check if your space heater even turns on. If it doesn’t turn on, there’s definitely a blown electric component inside.\nPlease check the next section on how to fix a broken space heater.\nStep-by-step Guide to Eliminating Heater Smells Let’s have a look at how to fix your space heater smell.\n1. Plastic smell: Run your space heater on full power To fix a new space heater smelling like plastic (due to outgassing), you can simply run your space heater on full power for a couple of hours.\nThe VOC gasses that cause the plastic smell evaporate at room temperature. But the higher the temperature, the more they evaporate and the faster the smell fades.\nSince VOCs are not healthy, I recommend running your space heater in a room you don’t use. Also, vent the room you use for outgassing regularly to get rid of all the chemicals.\nNew space heaters should smell a lot less like plastic after a couple of hours of running time.\n2. Plastic smell: Clean the heater’s exterior and vents If the plastic smell still remains after running your space heater at full power for a couple of hours, I recommend cleaning your space heater.\nPossibly, there is some residue from the manufacturer on the casing which causes all of the smell.\nYou don’t really need to use a special cleaner. A wet wipe with water should be enough.\nBut, of course, cleaners can help as well. However, to prevent your space heater from smelling like a cleaner, I recommend using a neutral cleaner or something that fades quickly, such as rubbing alcohol.\nRubbing alcohol is very good for removing any oily and greasy residue that can cause a plastic smell.\nI am cleaning my infrared heater with a simple wet wipe.\n3. Burning smell: Clean the heater’s heating elements. Usually, the burning smell fades within a minute or two. If the burning smell fades away quickly, there is nothing to worry about. Likely, it was just dust or hair on a heating element.\nIf the burning smell from your space heater doesn’t subside, there could be some sticky residue on it.\nThis only applies to space heaters with exposed heating elements, i.e. infrared heaters and ceramic heaters, and all other heaters where you can see the heating elements glowing.\nOil-filled radiators have embedded and sealed heating elements. So, they can’t cause any smells.\nUsually, the heating elements are protected by a safety grid. So, you have to disassemble parts of your space heater first. Once, the grid is off, you should be able to access the heating elements for cleaning.\nFor cleaning heating elements, you can use rubbing alcohol or plain water.\n4. Burning smell: Check the space heater’s power cord Another possible source of a burning smell is your space heater’s power cord.\nIf it gets too hot, it can give off strange smells. Overheating space heater power cords are a safety hazard.\nIf your space heater cord gets too hot, please check out this guide on fixing a space heater cord getting hot first.\n5. Burning smell: Checking and replacing faulty components If your space heater keeps giving off a burning smell, please shine a light at it and have a close look at whether you see smoke coming out of your space heater.\nIf your space heater is smoking, unplug it immediately, disassemble it and see which part broke.\nOnce you know the broken part replace it. You likely need a soldering iron for that.\nBut also if your space heater gives off a burning smell without any visible smoke, I recommend checking out the this space heater troubleshooting guide: How to fix a space heater not getting hot\nAlso, oftentimes, if your space heater has some electronic issue, it makes buzzing, screeching, or similar noises. If your space heater makes any kind of noise, you should also check out this guide on fixing space heater noises (with sound examples).\nTips to Prevent Future Odors in Your Space Heater To avoid encountering those unpleasant odors again, follow these practical and effective steps to ensure your space heater remains fresh and efficient:\n1. Occasional cleaning and air purification Like any other electronic equipment, space heaters require routine maintenance.\nDust and debris can accumulate quickly, especially if you use your heater frequently.\nBurning smell from dust accumulation is very common.\nOne thing that can significantly reduce indoor dust and improve air quality at the same time is using an air purifier.\nMy personal favorite air purifier is the Levoit Core 300 (see my review). And on top of preventing any future dust buildup, air purifiers actually reduce odors.\nWith the right HEPA + carbon filter, air purifiers are even able to pick up the plastic smell-causing VOCs from the air. So, they are perfect for the “burn-in” phase of your space heater.\n2. Proper storage during off-seasons To further limit dust and residue accumulation on your space heater, store it in a dust-free space, such as a storage room or the attic.\nIdeally, cover it with a cloth or keep it in its original box.\n3. Using heaters in well-ventilated spaces While using your space heater, especially for the first time after a purchase or after a long time, ensure that the room is well-ventilated.\nThis will help the VOCs and other odors to dissipate faster and ensure you breathe cleaner air.\n4. Don’t use a poor-quality space heater The cheaper your space heater is, and the more plastic it contains, the higher the likelihood of your space heater smelling.\nReally cheap space heaters don’t just outgas in the beginning. Over time, a cheap heater’s plastic casing melts near the heating elements which creates further plastic and burning smells.\nSo, please do yourself the favor and use good quality space heaters. They pay for themselves and can even save you money in the long run.\nWhat to do if your Space Heater doesn’t stop smelling If your space heater doesn’t stop smelling, I recommend simply getting a new one. Something is seriously off with your space heater.\nEither it’s a broken electronic component, a short circuit that causes overheating, or simply bad build quality.\nIn this case I recommend replacing your space heater with a high quality infrared heater.\nI recommend getting this Dr Infrared heater (click to see my review). Due to its wooden case material, it does not smell at all.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-space-heater-smell/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAfter turning on a new space heater or a space heater that was long unused, it is very common to notice strange smells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome space heaters smell like something’s burning.

I love solving simple, day-to-day electronic problems. Not the abstract stuff you study at university.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"How to Fix Space Heater Smell (Plastic, Burning)"},{"content":"Your space heater’s power cord is getting hot and you have no idea whether you should worry about it?\nIn this guide, we are going to check your space heater’s cord together.\nMy name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer, and I have two space heaters at hand of which I am going to check cord temperatures.\nOne cord is getting hot, the other stays cool. But that\u0026rsquo;s normal. A space heater power cord getting hot is not necessarily dangerous.\nIn fact, some heat is expected. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out why and what to do about it.\nThere are dozens of websites spreading panic about space heater cords overheating. Let’s approach the whole situation with a calm and rational mind.\nLet’s have a look.\nHow hot should a space heater cord get? I have two electric space heaters at home, an infrared heater, and an oil-filled radiator.\nAll of them work just fine.\nSo, let’s see how hot their cords get.\nSpace heater****Cord temperature (after 10 minutes)****DescriptionInfrared heater (800W)75.3°F (24°C)Not hot at allOil-filled radiator (2,500W)94.4°F (34.7°C)Feels warmSpace heater cord temperature measured with a Bosch laser thermometer\nAs you can see, the cord of my oil-filled radiator space heater gets significantly hotter than the infrared heater’s cord.\nBut none of them is hot.\nWhy do space heater cords get hot? In the experiment above, I showed that some space heater cords get hot while others don’t.\nFor the measurements, I used one 800W space heater and one 2,500W space heater.\nThe more powerful 2,500W space heater’s cord is warmer than the weak space heater’s cord.\nElectric current heats up the power cord Too much electricity in a power cord causes heat buildup. Electrons charge from your wall outlet to the space heater’s heating elements, passing through the metal wire inside your power cord.\nThe more current your space heater draws from the wall outlet, the more electrons flow, and the more these electrons bump into the wire’s metal atoms, shaking them around and creating heat.\nA typical American 1,500W space heater draws 12.5 Amps from a 120V US wall outlet. That’s a lot for a regular power cord and, therefore, heat buildup is normal.\nAs you can see in the experiment table, the stronger a space heater is, the hotter the power cord gets.\nMeasurement of the 2,500W heater power cord temperature: 94.4°F\nHeat coming from the space heater heats the power cord While measuring my space heaters’ temperatures, I noticed one interesting thing.\nThe infrared heater’s cord temperature was very low. One explanation is the lower wattage of that particular heater model.\nHowever, another reason the cord did not heat up as much is the directional heat of infrared heaters.\nInfrared heaters emit most of their heat as infrared heat and a small part of their heat through convection (hot air rising from the heater).\nNone of the heat from the infrared heater radiates toward the power cord.\nOn the other hand, the oil-filled radiator’s cord gets a lot warmer. But the higher power consumption (2,500W vs. 800W) is not the only explanation.\nI noticed parts of the cord getting warm, simply because the oil-filled radiator also radiates heat toward the power cord.\nThe black power cord absorbs a lot of the heat and heats up.\nTo make sure the oil-filled radiator’s heat is not the only reason for the cord heating up, I measured the temperature across the power cord.\nThe cord was warm everywhere, which explains the heat up due to the electric current.\nBut the closer I measured to the heater, the hotter it got.\nSpace heater power cords can also get hot because the heater radiates heat directly at the cord. Large currents passing through the cord and external heat exposure add up.\nIs my space heater power cord getting hot safe? If your space heater meets your wall outlet’s power specification, your space heater power cord getting hot is safe and expected.\nIn the measurements performed earlier, I can guarantee that the wall outlet specs fulfill the space heater’s power requirement.\nSo, a space heater cord getting warm is expected.\nLarge currents will always heat a power cord. And external heat exposure from the space heater radiating a part of its heat at the power cord is expected as well.\nAttention:\nA space heater power cord getting warm is normal. But overheating is not expected and is always unsafe.\nSafety checks for a space heater cord getting too hot Your space heater’s power cord has to fulfill all of the following tests. If it passes each test, you can safely continue to use your space heater.\n1. Body temperature check: Follow this rule of thumb:\nYour space heater’s power cord should never be hotter than your armpit (which is about body temperature).\nBody temperature is a good reference since it roughly matches the temperature of the strong 2,500W space heater’s cord from the experiment performed earlier.\n2. Heat fading away after turning space heater off check: Turn your space heater off, but leave it plugged into the wall outlet. If the power cord remains hot, the space heater is drawing power from the wall outlet.\nThis indicates a short circuit or a broken part in the space heater’s internal electronics.\nIf the power cord remains hot after turning the space heater off, unplug it immediately and get a new space heater.\n3. Wall outlet heat up \u0026amp; discoloring check: White power cords discolor over time. Here’s one simple question to ask yourself:\n“Is your space heater power cord turning brown?”\nIf yes, then your space heater cord is getting too hot. Either the cord is bad quality, or due to an electric fault, it carries too much current.\nPlease note:\nDiscoloring can also occur due to light exposure (UV, sunlight) or due to regular material aging. Another factor that supports cord discoloring is indoor air pollution and household chemicals.\nIn this case, however, the power cord usually doesn’t turn brown. Rather, it gets a beige-to-yellow tint.\nHow to fix a Space Heater cord getting hot A space heater cord getting too hot is usually straightforward to fix if you have soldering skills.\nIf you don’t have the skills and tools to solder, skip to the next section!\nFirst of all, you should get a heavy-duty extension cord. I recommend getting this Clear Power heavy-duty extension cord (click here to view it on amazon).\nDisassemble your space heater: First, open the space heater’s side where the power cord connects to. Locate the cord\u0026rsquo;s attachment, and desolder the old wires. Cut the female end off the heavy-duty cord \u0026amp; strip the ends of the wires. Solder the new extension cord in place. Reassemble your space heater. Replacing the space heater’s original power cord with a heavy-duty extension cord fixes overheating due to poor cord quality.\nHowever, it will not fix your cord overheating due to electronic issues. So, if the issue persists after the cord replacement, I recommend the following:\nWhat to do if you can’t fix your space heater cord getting hot If you can’t fix your space heater cord getting hot, I recommend getting a new heater.\nThe safety risk of running a potentially faulty space heater is just too high.\nOf course, you can also get your faulty space heater fixed. But this is both expensive, and, if something ever goes wrong and the fixed heater starts a fire, you’ll get problems with your insurance. They don’t like fixed space heaters.\nLuckily, there are hundreds of safe and affordable space heaters on the market.\nMy personal recommendation is this DeLonghi oil-filled radiator(click here to view it on amazon).\nIt comes with many built-in safety features, including overheat protection.\nAlso, DeLonghi oil-filled radiators last a very long time. Potentially decades. So, you don’t have to worry about buying replacement space heaters ever again.\nConclusion A warm power cord on a space heater is a common occurrence, especially for units with a higher wattage (1,200 Watts and more).\nHowever, it’s crucial to distinguish between a cord that’s merely warm and one that’s dangerously overheating.\nArmed with the knowledge from this guide, you’re well-prepared to make that call.\nHere’s a quick recap: Expect Some Heat: A little warmth in the cord, especially if you’re using a high-wattage heater, is to be expected due to the flow of electric current and potential heat radiation from the heater itself. Check for Danger Signs: If your cord exceeds body temperature, becomes discolored, or doesn’t cool down shortly after turning off the heater, these could be red flags.\nDiscoloration, especially if it turns brown or black, can be due to excessive heat or, in some cases, household chemicals. A wall outlet that heats up or discolors is also a concerning sign. Fixing the Issue: Using a heavy-duty extension cord or replacing the existing cord are viable options. Get a new heater: If you’re not comfortable with soldering or working with electronics, just get a new space heater.\nThis is the easiest way to be 100% safe.

After all, I can describe all the sounds space heaters make, but you still can’t be sure whether the sound your space heater is making is safe or needs repair.\nIn this article, I want to take a different approach.\nFor each sound, I will embed a real-life noise sample you can play and listen to.\nThis way, you can be absolutely sure about each noise type.\nQuick answer: Space heaters making clicking or humming noises are safe and expected. Rattling indicates loose parts. Screeching, squealing, or buzzing noises indicate electric issues. Fix or replace your heater.\nSpace Heater making noise: Safe or replace? Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the different noises space heaters make, whether they are safe and what to do about each noise.\nFor each space heater noise, I included a sound recording!\nClicking noise Clicking noises in a space heater are usually safe and expected.\nClicking noise sound recording:\nYour browser does not support the audio element. Explanation:\nWhen a space heater heats up, its surface material expands, which builds up tension. When that tension releases, a clicking sound occurs.\nMy infrared heater always makes a clicking sound after 10 - 15 minutes of heating.\nThat same clicking noise also occurs when I shut the infrared heater off. When the heater cools down and contracts, materials have to resettle in place and click when they release tension.\nAnother explanation for the clicking noise in a space heater is the built-in thermostat. Most space heaters that have a basic built-in thermostat make use of a so-called “two-point control”.\nTwo-point control is the simplest of all control mechanisms: It’s a switch switching the heater on and off automatically depending on the room’s temperature. Two-point control also switches to protect the space heater from overheating.\nIn space heaters with built-in thermostats, clicking noises are expected and perfectly safe.\nHumming noise Humming noise in a space heater is usually safe.\nHumming noise sound recording:\nYour browser does not support the audio element. Explanation:\nWhen your space heater draws power from the wall outlet, it has to transform the high alternating voltage to a lower voltage which the built-in electronics can handle.\nFor this, space heaters contain a transformer, which is a common electric component. Transformers work only with alternating currents and voltages.\nAnd the alternating currents coming from your wall outlet cause the transformer to make a humming noise.\nSimilarly, the humming noise can also come from the heating elements if your space heater just forwards the electric power to the heating elements without a transformer.\nThe electric power causes the heating element to vibrate and make a humming noise.\nScreeching noise Screeching noise is usually not safe and indicates a problem in the heater’s electronics.\nScreeching noise sound recording:\nYour browser does not support the audio element. Explanation:\nSpace heaters make screeching noises when there’s a loose or broken connection, or when a part is about to fail.\nUsually, the source of the screeching is fixable. However, since space heaters are power electronics, I recommend only fixing them yourself, if you have solid electronics knowledge and you have good soldering skills.\nHiring a technician is also an option. However, the cost of hiring someone is oftentimes higher than simply replacing the space heater with a new one.\nSo, if your space heater makes a screeching noise, I recommend getting a new one.\nSquealing noise Squealing noises indicate an electric failure and possibly a broken heating element.\nSquealing noise sound recording:\nYour browser does not support the audio element. Explanation:\nAlso, squealing noises can come from a capacitor in the built-in circuitry. In any case, it means that your space heater is broken and not safe to use.\nIf your space heater makes a squealing noise, replace it.\nBuzzing noise A space heater making a buzzing noise can be either safe or unsafe to use.\nBuzzing noise sound recording:\nYour browser does not support the audio element. Explanation:\nThe buzzing can come from the transformer (similar to the humming noise). In this case, it is likely safe.\nHowever, buzzing can also be a sign of an electronic fault.\nFor example, when there’s a short circuit or a blown part, the transformer might not be able to deliver all the power from the wall outlet to the heating elements. This superfluous power in the space heater can cause the buzzing.\nIn this case, the buzzing noise indicates a problem that needs to be fixed.\nI recommend getting a new space heater since it’s usually the easiest and fastest solution.\nUsually, it’s easy to distinguish safe buzzing from unsafe buzzing by asking yourself the question\n\u0026ldquo;Did your space heater make a buzzing noise when it was new?”.\nA new space heater making a buzzing noise is likely safe. However, if your space heater was quiet initially and only started making a buzzing noise later, it is unsafe and needs fixing or replacement.\nRattling noise Rattling noises usually come from loose moving parts in your space heater.\nRattling noise sound recording:\nYour browser does not support the audio element. Explanation:\nOne example is the built-in tip-over protection in many oil-filled radiators. When you move your space heater around, it makes a rattling noise, because, by design, the tip-over switch switches when you move your heater.\nIf that’s the case for you, the rattling is perfectly safe.\nAnother possible cause of a rattling noise can be a built-in fan inside your space heater. Broken bearings or loose parts can cause a continuous rattling sound.\nYou can disconnect your space heater from the wall outlet, disassemble it and check whether the fan sits firmly in position.\nAnother phenomenon is intermittent rattling. That’s when your space heater rattles for a few seconds or minutes after turning on. Then the rattling noise fades away.\nPossibly, the rattling returns later.\nThis can be the case when your space heaters\u0026rsquo; heating elements or a transformer, or other high-power components don’t sit in place firmly and vibrate during power surges.\nIntermittent rattling is not dangerous. But it is not expected in a well-working space heater either.\nAlthough you can possibly keep running your rattling space heater, I recommend getting a new one just to get rid of the annoyance.\nMore space heater noises If your space heater makes a strange noise, please record it (or describe it) and send it to me: daniel@heatertips.com\nI will check it personally and send you an explanation plus what to do about the noise within 24 hours (for free of course)!\nIn fact, that’s why I included the section about the rattling noise:\n“You didn\u0026rsquo;t cover rattling noise but mine is intermittent and it seems to have gone away after warming up. It just started rattling/clacking (I guess?) [How to describe sounds lol] but I\u0026rsquo;m hoping once I blow out the dust it will be okay.”\nHayle\nSo, feel free to reach out to me!\nRecommended replacement heater If the noise your space heater makes is screeching, squealing, or buzzing, you should get a new space heater.\nI recommend getting this infrared heater or this oil-filled radiator (click to read the reviews).\nBoth are great products. Oil-filled radiators are, however, safer and cheaper than infrared heaters.\nOn the other hand, infrared heaters heat a lot faster. And, the glowing red heating elements look nice!\nDecide however you prefer.\nIs your space heater making noise safe?

Which one is more energy efficient and produces the most heat for the least cost?\nWhen it comes to heating up your space, especially in those colder months, making an informed decision about which heater to use can save you both energy and money.\nWith many options available, two popular choices often come up: ceramic and infrared heaters.\nBut which one is more energy efficient? Is there even a difference efficiency-wise?\nThere are two kinds of efficiencies:\ntechnical energy efficiency (\u0026hellip; boring) perceived energy efficiency (how much you actually feel) In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll break down the true efficiency of these heaters. I’ll try to spare you all the technical jargon about Watts and whatsoever and get straight to the answers.\nAfter this explorative post on ceramic and infrared heater heating efficiencies, you’ll know exactly which heater to get and why.\nAnd to answer one of your most urgent questions right away…\nQuick answer: Ceramic and infrared heaters have the exact same technical energy efficiency. However, their perceived heating efficiency differs. Ceramic heaters need time to heat up the air, while infrared heaters immediately emit focused heat rays. Ceramic heaters need insulation to trap the hot air, infrared heaters don\u0026rsquo;t.\nRecommended infrared heater Based on all the things we’re uncovering later, here is my single top recommendation (to spare you the time).\nFor 99% of people, a good infrared heater far outperforms a ceramic heater in both heating efficiency and durability.\nMy all-time favorite infrared heater is this Dr Infrared Heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nI’ve already written a complete “best infrared heater” review about this particular model.\nI like this infrared heater because it heats a lot, it heats quickly, and it lasts you a lifetime.\nIf you were just looking for a good, solid heater, you can stop reading this article here, get the Dr Infrared, and continue living a happy life.\nBut, of course, this is heatertips.com, the most authentic and honest home heating website you’ll ever see. I am not making things up.\nSo, let’s have a very close look at both ceramic heaters and infrared heaters. Let me show you exactly how ceramic heaters and infrared heaters differ so you understand why you should rather get the infrared heater.\nThe Dr Infrared heater is my all-time favorite infrared heater!\nComparison of ceramic and infrared heaters Here’s a table with all the important properties of ceramic heaters and infrared heaters. If you understand the contents of this table, you’ll already know more about heaters than 90% of the population.\nIf some things are unclear, don’t worry, I’ll clarify everything in the section afterward!\nFeature/AspectCeramic HeatersInfrared Heaters****Heating principleHeats up ceramic plates to warm the air (which is good when multiple people are around)Emits focused infrared rays which heat whatever the heater is in front of the heater (ideal for individuals)Energy ConsumptionEqual: Usually 1,500 WattsEqual: Usually 1,500 WattsPerceived EfficiencyProduces warm air (like a hairdryer)Direct radiation (feels like the sun or fireplace)Heat-up time10 minutes or longer depending on room sizeA few secondsBest PlacementAreas where warm air can be trapped (e.g., under a desk, or in a small room)Wherever you need it, works everywhere (even outdoors is possible)Distance FactorPlacing a ceramic heater closer to you increases warmth, but a lot of heat passes by youPlacing an infrared heater closer to you increases warmth exponentially (since infrared rays are more focused at a small distance)NoiseOften have built-in fans, which create noisePerfectly silent, no noise at all\nEnergy efficiency vs perceived energy efficiency When talking about the energy efficiency of heaters, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to differentiate between technical energy efficiency and perceived energy efficiency.\nWhat’s technical energy efficiency? Technical energy efficiency describes how much electric energy you have to invest in order to get a certain amount of heat energy from of a heater.\nSome physics basics are enough to know everything about technical energy efficiency:\nAccording to the first law of thermodynamics, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another.\nIn the case of heaters, they work by converting electrical energy into thermal energy (heat). All electrical energy consumed by a heater is transformed into heat.\nAnd actually, this is the case for anything. Energy input will always result in heat (sooner or later).\nFor example, when you turn on a lightbulb, it produces light and heat. The light part of the energy eventually becomes heat as well.\n“In most devices, heat is waste energy”\nIn a heater, luckily, producing heat is exactly what we want. This means that none of the energy input in a heater is wasted.\nAnd since there is zero waste, heaters are always 100% efficient.\nHence, if two heaters are rated at the same wattage, they\u0026rsquo;ll produce the same amount of heat.\nBoth ceramic and infrared heaters are 100% efficient in their energy-to-heat conversion.\nHowever:\nTechnical energy efficiency is meaningless since it does not account for where the heat energy goes!\nWhy perceived energy efficiency is much more important I honestly don’t know if this term actually exists, possibly I invented it.\nPerceived efficiency is how we feel and experience the heat generated by a heater.\nThis perception can vary depending on how the heat is distributed, where the heater is placed, and how it interacts with our surroundings and us.\nOne simple example:\nImagine you have two infrared heaters. Now, you place one heater 10 feet away from you, and the other heater you place 1 foot in front of you.\nBoth heaters have the same technical efficiency of 100%. But the heater standing 1 foot in front of you feels incredibly hot, while you barely notice the other.\nSo, perceived energy efficiency is all about how much heat you actually feel. Perceived energy efficiency is what really matters.\nHow ceramic heaters distribute heat and how it feels like Ceramic heaters mainly produce hot air. They use a ceramic plate to heat the air, which then circulates around the room.\nThis means the hot air rises, displacing the colder air, creating a cycle that gradually warms up the entire room.\nA ceramic heater increases room temperature by blowing hot air into the room.\nCeramic heaters distribute the heat evenly within a room.\nWhile they might take a bit longer to make you feel warm compared to infrared heaters, they are good at heating enclosed spaces where the warm air can be trapped, like under a desk or a small room\nWhile writing this, there’s one thing I noticed:\nBasically, there is no difference between a ceramic heater and a hair dryer.\nI just had a quick Google search and, indeed, there are dozens of hair dryers advertising “ceramic technology”.\nI doubt the ceramic heating industry will like this, but:\nThere is no technical difference between a hair dryer and a ceramic space heater.\nJust like a hair dryer, ceramic heaters blow air over a ceramic heating element.\nSince ceramic heaters emit a stream of hot air, the heat coming from a ceramic heater is very dry. It dries out your skin, hair, and plants.\nLooking at this ceramic heater from the back side, you can see the built-in fan.\nDry heat is not necessarily bad! Especially, if you live in a humid environment, dry air sucks away superfluous moisture from your home.\nBy the way: here’s an article about 3 space heaters that don’t dry the air.\nAnd here’s one for the science about space heaters and humidity.\nAnyways:\nDo you use your hair dryer to heat your room? Likely not, because hair dryers are loud and the hot air quickly cools down as it mixes with the cool air in your room.\nAnd that’s exactly the problem with ceramic heaters.\nHow infrared heaters distribute heat and how it feels like Infrared heaters primarily use radiation as their method of heat distribution.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re in front of an infrared heater, the sensation is similar to the direct warmth you feel from the sun on a sunny day or sitting in front of a fireplace.\nThe heat targets objects and people directly without first warming the surrounding air.\nSo, infrared heaters even work outdoors. The wind can’t blow infrared radiation away. And if you stand in front of an infrared heater, whether indoors or outdoors, you feel heat.\nInfrared heaters are incredibly quick to heat up. After turning mine on, I notice heat within just a few seconds. And after a minute it is outputting heat at full capacity.\nCurious about the science behind this? Find out why infrared is hotter than visible light.\nBecause infrared heaters emit radiation, they don’t need a built-in fan. Infrared heaters are perfectly silent.\n“The infrared heater doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a fan because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t heat the air, the energy travels through space and heats any solid objects that are in its path (line of sight) as the sun does. It warms ONLY what it\u0026rsquo;s pointed at and that object then re-radiates the heat.”\nbtuhack\nA standout benefit of this method is the immediacy of the heat. There’s no waiting for the air to warm up; the moment you turn on an infrared heater, you can feel its heat.\nThis makes them exceptionally effective in larger or draftier spaces where air-based heating might be less efficient.\nBut that doesn’t mean they’re limited to large rooms. You can just as well use an infrared heater in a small room, under a table to warm your feet, in your bedroom, living room, etc.\nThey’re also beneficial in areas where quick, targeted heat is desired, like a chilly garage or a patio during a cold evening. If you’re wondering about their placement, here’s a guide on where to place an infrared heater.\nHowever, it’s worth noting that the heat can be quite directional. If you’re outside the heater’s direct path, you might not feel as warm. It’s essential to position these heaters strategically to maximize their effect.\nHere’s something where many people stop. They just assume “an infrared heater heats just in one direction, and the air remains cold”. That’s wrong!\nRemember how in the section on “technical energy efficiency” we discussed how all energy eventually ends up as heat?\nSo, even though an infrared heater emits directional \u0026amp; immediate heat rays, it will over time (just like a ceramic heater), heat the room’s air and raise room temperature.\nIn fact, when I hold my hand above my infrared heater, I feel hot air rising. That’s why it has hot-air escape slits on top.\nHow to optimize a ceramic vs infrared heater’s heating efficiency Based on everything we know about ceramic heaters and infrared heaters, let’s have a look at the best things you can do to maximize their perceived heat efficiencies!\nHere’s how to get the most heat out of your ceramic and infrared heaters:\nHow to maximize ceramic heater efficiency Ceramic heaters produce hot air which naturally tries to mix with the cold air in your room.\nThe only way to increase a ceramic heater’s efficiency is, therefore, to trap the hot air it emits!\nTrap hot air in small spaces Ensure your ceramic heater is placed in an area where its warmth can be effectively trapped, for instance, under a desk or in a smaller room.\nUnder a desk, you could even install a blanket to the front side of your desk to improve the hot air trapping. Just make sure the blanket doesn’t get too close to the heater’s hot air output.\nAlso, avoid air drafts from outdoors! For example, close the gap below your door. I recommend getting an under-door air draft blocker (click here to view one on amazon).\nReduce distance Placing the heater closer to where you sit or work can drastically increase the perceived warmth.\nIt’s a simple trick, but moving your heater a bit closer can make a world of difference in comfort.\nUse in rooms with multiple people Ceramic heaters are not only bad. So far, I’ve highlighted their shortcomings in comparison to infrared heaters. But there’s one occasion where ceramic heaters perform relatively well:\nCeramic heaters are great for heating rooms with multiple people, for example, family or guests.\nWith an infrared heater on the other hand, you’d overheat one person in direct line of sight in front of the heater, and the other people would sense indirect heat largely.\nCeramic heaters are very good at evenly heating a whole room which feels much more pleasant when you have guests around.\nEfficiency-wise, a ceramic heater in a crowded room maximizes the average perceived heating efficiency per person.\nHow to maximize infrared heater efficiency Let’s have a look at how to optimize an infrared heater’s perceived heating efficiency.\nPlace directly in front of you Because of the way radiation spreads, the energy density of the rays decreases the farther you are from the infrared heater. This intuitively makes sense.\nSo, place your infrared heater as close as possible to you. The closer you place it, the hotter it gets.\nI did an experiment with a laser thermometer in my post “Are infrared heaters safe indoors?”. And, according to the measurements, the temperature coming from an infrared heater rises exponentially with decreasing distance.\nAccordingly, you can increase efficiency exponentially by placing the heater closer to you.\nAvoid Obstructions Obviously, if you place anything between you and your infrared heater, the obstruction blocks off the heat.\nEnsure there’s nothing blocking the heater’s path.\nHowever, energy is not wasted! After some time, room temperature will rise (remember: All energy eventually ends up as heat).\nSo, you essentially transform your infrared heater into a regular convection heater by doing that.\nMake use of infrared rays instead!\n“The most efficient infrared heater placement is immediately in front of people.”\nquote from the guide: Where to place an infrared heater?\nHow to make a ceramic and an infrared heater more efficient Some things apply to all heaters, regardless of whether they are ceramic or infrared:\nInsulation: One of the most effective ways to maximize heat efficiency in any space is to minimize the amount of heat that leaves the room. You can do that using insulation.\nProper insulation reduces the amount of heat lost, allowing your heater to do its job without overworking.\nYou don’t need to renovate your whole home to see results. A regular air draft blocker below the door and carpets already help! Turn off the heater when you leave the room: While it might seem obvious, only use the heater when you need it. If you’re leaving a room for an extended period, consider turning the heater off or reducing its power.\nIf you run your heater in your absence, you essentially invest energy but get zero heat perception for it. So, running a heater when you are in a different room causes its perceived heat efficiency to drop to zero. Power consumption of ceramic and infrared heaters Almost all space heaters consume 1,500W of power. I’ve tested 21 different heaters and their power consumption, and the result is almost always the same.\nThere are some exceptions, such as small desk heaters or larger industrial-grade heaters.\nBut almost every space heater for home-use consumes 1,500W.\nThis includes both ceramic heaters and infrared heaters. There is absolutely no difference.\nThe reason is not that 1,500W is some magical number that maximizes heat efficiency or whatever.\n1,500W is simply the maximum power a US wall outlet can reliably output.\nA standard US wall outlet runs on a voltage of 120V.\nAnd the smallest US circuit breaker trips at 15 Amps.\n120 Volts × 15 Amps = 1,800W\nSo, 1,800W is the maximum power every US wall outlet supports. To not trip the circuit breaker and to allow other devices to run simultaneously, heater manufacturers make their heaters consume 1,500W. The 300 Watts difference is basically a safety margin.\nBoth infrared heaters and ceramic heaters consume 1,500 Watts of power on their highest setting.\nAnd again, here\u0026rsquo;s the fundamental point: when it comes to energy consumption, a ceramic heater and an infrared heater with the same wattage will consume exactly the same amount of energy and create exactly the same amount of heat.\n\u0026ldquo;Electric space heaters are ALL THE SAME! (With same wattage.) All 1,200 watt space heaters will put out the SAME amount of heat. Does not matter if they are oil filled, look like a fireplace, or whatever. It is the \u0026ldquo;watts\u0026rdquo;.”\nBilly_J\nThe efficiency difference between ceramic and infrared heaters has nothing to do with how much power they consume. It’s all about how ceramic heaters and infrared heaters distribute heat differently.\nAnd, in most cases, with an infrared heater, you have better options to maximize efficiency, since you don’t have to “trap” hot air.\nInfrared radiation just feels warm. There’s no need to trap heat.\nAre ceramic heaters or infrared heaters better for saving energy? Both ceramic and infrared heaters consume the same amount of power. But it’s easier to run an infrared heater at the lowest setting and still feel warm.\nInfrared heaters are better for saving energy. You can run an infrared heater on the lowest power setting and still feel warm immediately after turning it on. Meanwhile, a ceramic heater first has to heat the entire air in your room.\nIn a poorly insulated room, a ceramic heater possibly can’t even keep up with the heat loss.\nSo, in the worst case, a ceramic heater’s energy is fully wasted when you run it on the lowest setting.\nSo, infrared heaters are a much better choice than ceramic heaters for saving energy.\nMy recommendation is this Dr Infrared Heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nConclusion In almost all cases, infrared heaters have a better heating efficiency than ceramic heaters.\nCeramic heaters are only worth it if you want to evenly heat a room and you have a lot of time.\nBest use cases for ceramic heaters:\nMultiple people around, preferably even heat distribution: At parties, family gatherings, in a tent with multiple people Ironically, these are the times when you don’t really care about electricity costs.\nHowever, as soon as you’re alone, and you want localized heat (that eventually turns into whole-room heat), infrared heaters are by far the best choice.\nBest use cases for infrared heaters:\nWorks for both individuals and when multiple people are around: To heat in large rooms, to heat your family sitting on the couch, outdoors, in a shed, in the garage, in a workshop, in your bedroom, etc. I’d pick an infrared heater over a ceramic heater every day. They are much more versatile. I can use mine anywhere I like and I don’t have to pre-heat the room with an infrared heater.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/ceramic-vs-infrared-heater-efficiency/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCeramic heater or infrared heater?

Just recently, I noticed tower fans are trending.\nBut what are the differences between tower fans and pedestal fans? Are they better in any way?\nAnd what makes them so popular?\nIn this article, we’re going to take a dive into understanding tower fans and their purpose.\nAfter all, what’s the gap a tower fan fills that makes people want to buy them?\nQuick answer: Tower fans are not better than pedestal fans. Even the opposite is true. Looking at design, airflow, and safety, modern pedestal fans are just as good or even better than tower fans.\nStick out to the end of this article for my buying recommendations!\nTower Fans: An Overview Design: Typically slim, vertical design. Tower fans use very little space. They do not have a large fan attached at their top. Air Flow: Some tower fans oscillate, and some don’t. Tower fans produce a very directional stream of air, similar to that of a Dyson fan. Features: Modern tower fans come with features like timers, remote controls, and multiple speed settings. Noise Level: Generally quieter due to very stable and low-disturbance airflow. Similar to the noise level of a domestic air conditioner set to “fan”-mode (without cooling active). Safety: Inherently safe because the fan is embedded and not accessible. Price Range: Everything from cheap to expensive. Due to high competition, tower fans are very affordable. Many people believe them to be expensive, but you can get a good model that lasts you many years for as low as $60.\nBut of course, you can also go overboard and get an expensive tower fan for many hundreds of dollars (Dyson fans are a typical example, although they come with built-in air purification, etc.). Where is the fan inside a tower fan and how does it work? The first question I asked myself when I first saw a tower fan was: “Where is the fan inside that thing?”\nI could not wrap my mind around how something can blow air without having a fan.\nThe fan inside a tower fan is very interesting. It’s a squirrel-cage-type drum that spins vertically (instead of horizontally) inside the tower fan’s case.\nThis rotating drum has many fins that scoop air up and force it out in a narrow stream of air.\nThis is actually the same principle that is used in common air purifiers, which have these long slits and blow out a thin, long stream of air.\nBecause the air stream is so “perfect” (for techies: it’s a laminar flow), it causes very little turbulence around it. This, in turn, means that tower fans are exceptionally silent.\nPedestal Fans: An Overview Design: Stand on an adjustable pedestal (hence their name) and are height-adjustable. Usually, they have a large base or feet to stand on, since their center of mass is so high due to the oscillating fan on top.\nWithout the wide base or feet, a pedestal fan is prone to tip over. Air Flow: Can oscillate and cover a wide angle. Pedestal fans usually can move more air volume in a given time (meaning the airflow rate is high) due to their open design.\nBut since the airstream is not as narrow as that of a tower fan, it is slower (according to Bernoulli’s principle). Features: Contrary to popular belief, pedestal fans don’t have fewer features. Just like tower fans, pedestal fans have airspeed settings, timers, and remote controls.\nThis Dreo PolyFan(click to view it on amazon) even integrates with WiFi (for smart homes) and features voice control. Noise Level: Can be noisier than tower fans, especially at higher speeds. The reason is that most pedestal fans create more turbulence.\nAlthough, modern pedestal fans improved recently due to optimized fan designs. Safety: Blades are typically covered with grills, but there’s still a risk for kids/pets if they stick their fingers through.\nUsually, the fan protection is sufficient. I think the bigger safety issue is the risk of the fan tipping over. Price Range: From very cheap to expensive. Pedestal fans are not necessarily cheap, even though every blog post I read online indicates that (probably in order to sell them).\nI’d say a good pedestal fan costs about as much as a good tower fan. There is no significant price difference. Comparing Tower Fans and Pedestal Fans I’ve already hinted at some differences and similarities between tower fans and pedestal fans in the previous sections. But let’s have a proper look.\nDesign Here are my 2 cents on fan design nobody wants to hear:\nEverywhere online I see people writing “Tower fans look more modern”, arguing that this makes them better.\nSolely looking at the design, however, I prefer when the look of a device matches its intent.\nWhen I see a lengthy plastic tower, I can’t tell whether it’s a tower fan! It might as well be a tower heater or an air purifier.\nAnd I am not making this up. These 3 totally different devices all look exactly the same.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an image of an air purifier, a tower heater and a tower fan:\nMaybe you know the answer. But you get the point: Tower fans are not easy to recognize.\nOn the other hand, when I see a pedestal fan, I instantly recognize it as a fan. I like that.\nSo, my (personal) favorites in this regard are pedestal fans.\nAirflow \u0026amp; thrust Thrust is the force with which a fan shoves air through the room. The more thrust it has, the better the airflow is.\nPedestal fans usually win this comparison. However, there are strong tower fans that blow as much air as strong pedestal fans.\nI’d say airflow depends more on the CFM (cubic feet per minute) airflow rating of the fan than on the fan type.\nBy the way, the Dreo PolyFan has 4 times higher thrust when compared to a Dyson fan.\nSpace Saving Oftentimes tower fans are marketed as “space-saving”. But is that actually true?\nIf I compare a modern tower fan with a modern pedestal fan, there is not a big difference.\nLet’s have a look at two up-to-date models from Dreo:\nThey are both about equal in size. There is no significant difference. Of course, the pedestal fan takes up more volume at its top.\nNow, let’s compare a classic \u0026amp; cheap tower fan with a classic \u0026amp; cheap pedestal fan:\nAs you can see, the size difference is much more significant in low-end fans.\nI’d say:\nBoth modern tower fans and pedestal fans take up little space. Cheap pedestal fans, however, are usually larger than cheap tower fans.\nAirflow oscillation There are some oscillating tower fans. But here I have to give the point to pedestal fans right away.\nPedestal fans are the ultimate air distributors. We all associate pedestal fans with their oscillating movement.\nI’d argue, the oscillation is the single reason why pedestal fans are so popular, even after decades, as compared to non-oscillating floor fans.\nThe oscillation is simple yet effective. Oscillation is the key feature of a pedestal fan.\nIf you want oscillation, you have to get a pedestal fan. It’s just the right thing to do.\nThe engineering behind the fan’s oscillation is flawless: video\nFeatures \u0026amp; Controls Again, instead of following the crowd crying “tower fans are more modern and have more feature”, let me reveal the truth:\nTower fans have not a single feature advantage over pedestal fans.\nJust like tower fans, pedestal fans come with remote controls, airspeed settings and timers. Some pedestal fans even integrate with smart home \u0026amp; WiFi systems such as Alexa.\nSome pedestal and tower fans even have their own control apps.\nIf you ever hear anyone saying that pedestal fans lag behind tower fans technologically, that’s just nonsense.\nWhy would a pedestal fan company not integrate up-to-date software features in their fans?\nBoth tower and pedestal fans come with all features you need. Pedestal fans are in no way inferior to tower fans.\nNoise Tower fans are usually quieter because of their laminar airflow, which causes little turbulence.\nHowever, laminar airflow comes at the cost of general airflow thrust and oscillation.\nYou could even argue because tower fans tend to be weaker than pedestal fans, they are less noisy.\nIn real life, I don’t really notice a difference between a tower fan’s and a pedestal fan’s noise level. Only with a dB-meter, you can measure slight differences.\nThe noise difference is not significant.\nSafety For adults, safety-wise tower fans or pedestal fans don’t make a difference. If you are the type of person to shove your finger through the safety grid, so be it. Both tower fans and pedestal fans will hurt you.\nFor any sufficiently intelligent being, neither tower fans nor pedestal fans pose any safety risks.\nIf you have small kids or pets at home, arguably a pedestal fan is even safer since the blade is out of reach.\nIn a tower fan, the blade starts just a few inches above the ground. So, a small child, a puppy or a cat can easily reach it.\nPedestal fans are height adjustable, so you can easily adjust the fan to be out of reach.\nChildren can tip pedestal fans over. But they can tip anything over, including your wardrobe, a standing lamp, your TV or anything else standing around.\nArguably, pedestal fans are safer than tower fans, because their fan blades are out-of-reach for small children and pets. If you have children or pets, you need a pedestal fan.\nPrice There is no significant price difference between pedestal and tower fans given they both provide the same features.\nGood pedestal fans cost as much as good tower fans cost.\nAnd bad pedestal fans cost as little as bad tower fans cost.\nIf you’re looking for the cheapest possible fan (most airflow for smallest price), you should not get a tower or pedestal fan anyways.\nThe cheapest possible fan is a floor fan (click to view one on amazon). Floor fans get you the most airflow for the least money.\n6. Recommendations: Which One to Choose? You probably already made up your mind whether you prefer a tower fan or a pedestal fan.\nSo, here are my two recommendations:\nMust-have pedestal fan The Dreo PolyFan (click here to view it on amazon) is the nicest pedestal fan ever built. It’s got all the features a tower fan has, but it\nlooks awesome (it’s an absolute eye-catcher) feels awesome (flawless touch, remote, and app controls) and keeps even the largest homes ventilated This fan stops sweaty \u0026amp; smelly family gatherings. Plus, I guarantee, every time someone visits, they will comment on the fan.\nSee how the Dreo PolyFan blends in. It looks much nicer than a weird tower.\nRecommended tower fan My favorite tower fan is this Vornado OSCR37 tower fan (click here to view it on amazon). It has everything you’d ever need in a fan. If you pick the “Alexa Enabled” version, you’d even get smart home integration to automate everything.\nConclusion: How to pick In almost any case, I’d pick the pedestal fan over the tower fan. Although, admittedly, both are very sleek models.\nI just like the pedestal fan’s strong airflow that can wipe my morning bedroom smell out the window within a couple of minutes.\nAnd, additionally, pedestal fans look like actual fans. Which sounds stupid, but it simplifies my home.\nAt the beginning of this article, I opened with the question: “What makes tower fans so popular?” (as compared to pedestal fans).\nThe answer is: It’s plain marketing and novelty.\nTower fans are in no way superior to pedestal fans. Manufacturers try to sell you on the novelty.\nA new design does not mean a product is better. It’s just a new design.\nAnd because pedestal fans are still technically superior, they are still around, reliably ventilating homes for over a century.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-tower-fans-better-than-pedestal-fans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre tower fans better than pedestal fans?

Air Quality Indicator Light Coway air purifiers have a built-in pollution sensor. Based on the sensor’s readings, the air purifier changes the air quality indicator light color.\nDepending on the model, the air quality indicator light changes as follows (according to the official Coway Airmega 300 / 400 user manual):\nAir Quality400S / 300S400 / 300GoodBlue and greenBlueModerateGreen and yellowPurpleUnhealthyYellow and pinkPinkVery UnhealthyPink and redRed\nAs you can see, the 400S/300S models use two colors, while the 400/300 models use just one color.\nIn all models, blue indicates good air quality, while pink and red indicate bad air quality.\n2.

Usually, blinking indicators are expected and harmless.\nAfter plugging the air purifier into the wall outlet After plugging a Coway air purifier into a wall outlet, all indicator lights blink.\nIn the Coway Airmega App In the Coway Airmega app, a blinking filter icon means that the filter needs replacement.\nA red filter icon means that the remaining lifetime is 20%. In this case, you can continue running the air purifier until the filter icon starts blinking.\nHow to fix persistently blinking Coway air purifier indicators If your Coway air purifier’s indicator lights keep blinking without stopping, there is a fault in the air purifier.\n1. How to fix individual indicators blinking (Pre Wash, Max2 Change) Usually, the Pre Wash or Max2 indicators stop blinking after you wash or replace the respective filter, reinsert it and press and hold the Pre Wash or Max2 button for 3 seconds.\nIf that’s not the case, I’d try the following:\nReplace the filter again: Take out the filter. If there is leftover dust, clean it properly. Reinsert it. Hold the respective button for 3 seconds again. Turn the air purifier off and on: Sometimes the easiest fix may “unstick” the blinking indicator light. Contact Coway for a fix or replacement: If you are still within Coway’s 2 year warranty, contact Coway support and have them replace your device. 2. How to fix all indicators blinking at once Usually, all indicators blink at once right after plugging your device into the wall outlet. If the blinking doesn’t stop after a few seconds, there is likely a fault in the air purifier’s power electronics.\nIn this case, I highly recommend you have a look at this post: How to fix an air purifier not turning on\nThere, we have a closer look at how to inspect an air purifier and how to fix the built-in electronics.\nIf you don’t have the skills to fix your Coway air purifier yourself, I recommend contacting Coway support.\nThis really shouldn’t happen.\nTemplate mail to contact Coway support regarding blinking indicator lights Here’s a template mail you can use to get a replacement air purifier from Coway:\nTo: info@coway.com\nSubject: Request for Air Purifier Replacement under Warranty\nDear Coway Support,\nI\u0026rsquo;m reaching out regarding my Coway air purifier, which has persistently blinking indicator lights.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve made sure to properly clean the pre-filters and replace the filters, and I\u0026rsquo;ve tried resetting the air purifier by turning it off and on.

After all, Dyson fans are not cheap.\nIn this article, we’re going to have a quick look at the 5 most common issues with a Dyson fan not cooling.\nQuick answer: A Dyson fan is usually not cooling because of blocked airways (air filter, air inlet holes). Also, check the set target temperature, and ensure your Dyson cooling fan does not run in backward airflow mode.\nUsually, the issues are relatively easy to fix. I will guide you through.\nBut first of all, one important note.\nDyson fans don’t cool by reducing the temperature A Dyson fan, regardless of whether you got a simple Dyson Cool (such as the AM07), or a Hot+Cool model, never cools.\nAt least not in a physical sense.\nDyson Cool fans can’t reduce your room’s temperature and blow cold air. They are simple fans.\nThe reason is that they don’t work like actual air conditioners, which have to be vented outside.\nInstead, Dyson Cool fans recirculate and distribute the air within your room. Because they don’t vent the heat outside, there is no way for the heat to leave.\nA Dyson cooling fan cools by carrying hot layers of air away from your skin. This creates a cooling effect but does not reduce room temperature.\nThis is a frequent misunderstanding.\nIf your Dyson creates a strong airflow, it is working perfectly fine.\nCauses and fixes for your Dyson fan not cooling If your Dyson fan, however, doesn’t blow air, there can be no cooling effect. Here are the most common causes and fixes:\n1. Clogged air filter The Dyson Pure Cool models have built-in filters. If the filter is clogged, it blocks proper airflow.\nHow to check: Turn off and unplug your Dyson fan. Remove the filter and run the fan.\nIf it blows cold air when running without a filter, then the clogged filter is the cause of the problem.\n“If your Dyson heater blows [\u0026hellip;] air when running it without a filter, you can tell for sure that the air filter is the cause of the problem.”\nDyson Hot+Cool repair guide\nHow to fix: Clean or replace the air filter.\nFor cleaning, refer to the user manual for specific instructions, which typically involve vacuuming the filter or washing it with water.\nAfter cleaning, ensure the filter is completely dry before placing it back into the fan.\nIf the filter is damaged or overly saturated with dirt and debris, it\u0026rsquo;s best to replace it with a new one.\nAlternatively, you can also simply run your Dyson without the air filter. This saves you a couple bucks in filter replacement costs.\nWithout a filter, Dyson cooling fans blow much more air, which creates a better cooling effect.\nBut beware: Running a Dyson fan without a filter voids the warranty. And, of course, without a filter, there is no air purification effect.\n2. Clogged air inlet holes In order for a Dyson cooling fan to blow out air, it first has to suck it in. All air passes the so-called air inlet holes (at the base of the fan).\nIf these are clogged, your Dyson fan can’t blow air.\nHow to check: Look at the air inlet holes and check if there are any visible obstructions or a buildup of dust.\nIf there are, this could be hindering airflow.\nHow to fix: Use a soft brush or vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to gently clean the inlet holes.\nMake sure the fan is turned off and unplugged while doing this.\nThese are the air inlet holes!\n3. Clogged internal parts The third (and last) place of dust accumulation is a Dyson fan’s internal parts. Over the months, a Dyson fan can accumulate a lot of dust on its inside.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve already checked the air filter and inlet holes and the fan is still not working, the issue might be with clogged internal parts.\nLet’s have a look at that.\nHow to check: Open your Dyson cooling fan’s case. The built-in electronics sit right between the air filter (at the bottom) and the fan (at the top).\nHow to fix: Use compressed air or a soft brush to clean the internal parts, ensuring you don\u0026rsquo;t damage any components.\nDon’t use water here! Water can damage the electronics.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how much dust accumulates in a Dyson over time.\n4. Target temperature set too high (for Dyson Hot+Cool) For Dyson Hot+Cool models, there\u0026rsquo;s a thermostat that allows users to set a desired room temperature.\nIf your fan isn’t cooling, it may be because the target temperature is set higher than the room\u0026rsquo;s current temperature.\nHow to check: Check your Dyson fan’s temperature setting (if available). Not all Dyson fans have this. But Hot+Cool models usually have it.\nHow to fix: Set the lowest possible temperature and see if your Dyson fan blows cold air now.\nIf it works now, the temperature was merely set too high. You can adjust the temperature setting from here.\n5. Dyson set to backward airflow mode Dyson Pure Cool fans have a backward airflow mode. In backward airflow mode, the airflow is close to imperceptible, and as a result, it won’t blow any cold air.\nIn fact, the point of this mode is to have air purification without cooling.\nHere’s how Dyson describes backward airflow mode:\n“ Backward airflow mode. Purifies without cooling you. In backward airflow mode, the unique Dyson air valve projects air through the back of the machine, while maintaining effective purification.”\nDyson Pure Cool features page\nHow to check: For the Dyson Pure Cool and Dyson Humidiy+Cool models that have a backward airflow mode, the airflow will be directed away from you.\nThe air isn\u0026rsquo;t blowing toward you even when the fan is running.\nThe highlighted lower left button is the \u0026ldquo;backward airflow mode\u0026rdquo; button.\nHow to fix: Change the fan\u0026rsquo;s airflow direction mode using the remote control or the button on the fan, switching it from backward airflow mode to its regular mode.\nThis should allow the fan to blow air in your direction, giving the cooling effect.\nYour Dyson is still not cooling? If, after checking for all these potential issues, your Dyson fan is still not cooling, I recommend the following:\nCheck if you still have the 2 years warranty. Dyson might replace or repair your fan.\nAlternatively, instead of relying on Dyson for help, you can sell your broken Dyson cooling fan.\nThere are hundreds of electronics hobbyists online, looking for Dyson products with these exact problems to fix and flip them for a profit.\nThey’ll compete to win the bid and you’ll get a fair price, even though you sell the device as defective.\nMeanwhile, expecting money to come in soon, I recommend getting a new Dyson cooling fan, such as the Dyson Hot+Cool HP01 (click here to view it on amazon).\nConclusion Usually, fixing a Dyson fan not cooling is easy. Mostly, it’s just clogged airways, for example, a filter that needs replacement, clogged air inlet holes, or clogged internals.\nAlso, oftentimes, it’s just a wrong choice of settings. Dyson fans don’t blow cold air when their target temperature is set too high, or when you run them in backward mode.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/dyson-fan-not-cooling-fixes/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA Dyson fan not cooling (anymore) can be very frustrating.

Naturally, I have to take care of her.\nHowever, as an HVAC blogger, I have all kinds of devices at home, including an air purifier.\nSo, how did things turn out?\nDid the dog survive the air purifier? (\u0026hellip; joking)\nIn this article, I am going to guide you through using air purifiers with pets.\nAfter reading this, you’ll know exactly:\nwhether you can use an air purifier in the presence of a pet which air purifiers you can use with a pet and which you can’t (yes, there are a couple of air purifiers that have negative health impacts) my personal pet-safe air purifier recommendation how to pet-proof your air purifier how to air-purifier-proof your pet Quick answer: Yes, air purifiers are generally safe for pets. However, ensure you’re using a HEPA air purifier. Never use an ionizing air purifier or an ozone generator. These purifiers create unhealthy ozone and can sicken your pet.\nFirst of all, let’s have a list at a list of pets and whether you can use an air purifier with them:\nDifferent pets and whether air purifiers are safe for them **Pet****Are Air Purifiers Safe for this Pet?**Grown dogsGenerally safe, but avoid ozone-producing purifiers.PuppiesSafe, but limit access to the purifier’s power cordCatsGenerally safe, but avoid ozone-producing purifiers. Place the air purifier on a low surface (since cats like to climb and tip-over things)BirdsUse with caution. Birds have sensitive respiratory systems. Avoid ozone and ensure good ventilation.Fish (in an aquarium)Generally safe. Ensure the purifier’s airflow doesn\u0026rsquo;t disturb the water\u0026rsquo;s surface tension or produce ozone.Hamsters/GerbilsGenerally safe, but ensure proper ventilation and avoid ozone-producing purifiers.Guinea PigsGenerally safe, but ensure proper ventilation and avoid ozone-producing purifiers.RabbitsGenerally safe, but ensure proper ventilation and avoid ozone-producing purifiers.Reptiles (lizards, snakes, etc.)Generally safe. Ensure proper ventilation and avoid direct airflow that could affect the habitat\u0026rsquo;s temperature.Amphibians (frogs, newts, etc.)Generally safe. Ensure the purifier doesn\u0026rsquo;t alter the habitat\u0026rsquo;s humidity or produce ozone.Tarantulas/InsectsLimited data. Keep air purifiers at a distance and ensure no strong drafts.\nWhich air purifiers you can use with a pet and which you can’t use Air purifiers are generally safe for pets as long as they only remove particles from the air.\nLess pollution directly leads to better health ( source), for humans and for pets. And higher pollution levels do the opposite: They have a negative health impact.\nSo, using an air purifier is generally a good idea.\nHowever:\nA certain type of air purifier, a so-called ionizer, does the exact opposite. Even though ionizers are apparently marketed as air purifiers, they can even increase air pollution levels according to a study from H. F. Hubbard from the University of Texas ( source).\nAlso, ionizers indirectly generate ozone, a gas that increases the chances of lung diseases, sore throats, coughing, and asthma attacks ( source).\nIf ionizers are bad for you, they can’t be healthy for your (much more sensitive) pet.\nSo:\nDon’t get an ionizing air purifier.\nEven worse are so-called ozone generators, which are normally used to neutralize odors in the absence of humans. But some people run them at home, which is not a good idea.\nAvoid ionizers and ozone generators at all costs.\nMy personal pet-safe air purifier recommendation Instead, I recommend getting a regular air purifier that does not blast electric charges or ozone in the air. Any regular HEPA filter air purifier will do.\nHEPA filter air purifiers merely blow indoor air through a filter, which picks up particles. HEPA filters cause zero indoor emissions.\nMy favorite HEPA air purifier is this Levoit Core 300 air purifier (click here to see it on amazon).\nIt is pet-safe and, due to its round design, has no sharp corners.\nBut you don’t have to follow my recommendation. Get any air purifier you like. As long as you can spot the word HEPA and not the word “ionizer”, or “ozone” on the sales page, you are safe.\nOf course, you can also go and pick up an air purifier at a local hardware store.\nSpecial air purifier recommendation for birds The Levoit Core 300 (and other air purifiers in the Core series) blow air upwards, which may confuse your birds.\nIn nature, vertical airflows actually mimic the air lifting right before a thunderstorm.\nBirds are weather-sensitive and I think it’s not wise to create pre-thunderstorm conditions indoors.\nSo, for birds, I recommend getting an air purifier with a vertical airflow:\nI recommend this Germ Guardian air purifier (click here to view it on amazon) for rooms with birds How different pets react to air purifiers (and what to consider for safety) Grown Dogs Depending on the temperament of your dog, he may care or not care about the air purifier. Usually, there are absolutely no issues running an air purifier near a grown dog.\nIf your dog finds the fan noise annoying, he will leave the room. Usually, it’s safe to just try it out.\nPuppies While air purifiers are safe for young pups, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to protect those curious little ones from potential chewing hazards like power cords.\nEven though air purifiers consume very little power, the power cord will carry your wall outlet’s voltage (in the US, that’s 120V), which is potentially life-threatening to a puppy.\nSo, either run your air purifier in a separate room or place your air purifier on an elevated surface your puppy can’t reach and use an unreachable wall outlet.\nCats Cats will benefit from an air purifier, but remember they\u0026rsquo;re climbers!\nPosition your air purifier on a low surface to prevent air purifier fall damage, and, of course, always avoid ozone-producing models.\nBirds Our avian companions have particularly sensitive respiratory systems.\nAccording to the study \u0026ldquo;The Canary in the Coal Mine: The Sensitivity of Avian Species to Environmental Contaminants\u0026rdquo; ( source), birds can be especially susceptible to pollutants.\nSo, air purifiers will greatly enhance your bird’s quality of life. After all, in nature, birds are always able to breathe fresh air flying at great heights.\nEnsure your air purifier used is ozone-free.\nIn a bird forum, one member writes:\n“I have a Germ Guardian [..] and two Levoit H13 (one small for the bird room with night cage and the other large for the living room with day bird cage) [..] The Levoits are great and also affordable. I bought these separately at different times for various rooms and would probably pick a higher-end full-house one if I could and had it to do all over again.”\nIsabelle\nThe pet-safe full-house air purifier she refers to is probably the Levoit EverestAir (click to see it on amazon).\nThis parrot enjoys his Levoit Core air purifier!\nFish (in an aquarium) Using an air purifier near your aquarium is generally safe.\nHowever, ensure the purifier\u0026rsquo;s airflow doesn\u0026rsquo;t disturb the water surface. Also, ensure that your air purifier doesn\u0026rsquo;t emit ozone, since water dissolves ozone.\nHamsters/Gerbils These little rodents will appreciate clean air. When using an air purifier, make sure the space remains well-ventilated and that the device doesn\u0026rsquo;t emit ozone.\nGuinea Pigs Just like hamsters, guinea pigs thrive in clean, well-ventilated spaces. Use ozone-free air purifiers to keep them comfortable.\nRabbits Your hopping friend prefers a clean environment. An air purifier can help, but always maintain proper ventilation and avoid those producing ozone.\nReptiles (lizards, snakes, etc.) Reptiles also benefit from purified air. But you do as well:\n“I use an air purifier in his room for snakes/geckos, you can still smell fresh poops when they have just been done but it definitely keeps general smells down”\nJamesJ from reptileforums\nHowever, be cautious about the purifier\u0026rsquo;s airflow, ensuring it doesn\u0026rsquo;t alter their habitat\u0026rsquo;s crucial temperature.\nAir purifiers normally don’t change temperature. But it could impact terrarium temperature by carrying heat away from it.\nAmphibians (frogs, newts, etc.) Keeping the air clean for your amphibians is a great idea, but be cautious. Ensure the purifier doesn\u0026rsquo;t mess with the humidity they love, and as always, avoid ozone.\nTarantulas/Insects The data is a bit sparse when it comes to our many-legged friends. I found one guy in a Tarantula forum, ozone doesn’t affect Tarantulas.\nBut still, it does affect you. Another tarantula guy writes:\n\u0026ldquo;I keep a HEPA filter running at all times in my spider room, but it\u0026rsquo;s not one of the ionic ones. It\u0026rsquo;s nice to keep the air circulating, and the filters are always nasty when I change them.”\nGoTerps\nWhy you should get an air purifier as a pet owner\nAfter digging through dozens of studies and through various pet forums, I found one common theme:\nEverybody recommends using air purifiers, regardless of which pet you have at home.\nAir purifiers do not only remove potentially harmful viruses and bacteria from the air.\nAs a pet owner, your immune system is probably better than average anyways, so why would you care?\nThe biggest advantage to using an air purifier is that air purifiers reduce pet smells.\nAir purifiers clear the air and make it a lot more pleasant for you to live together with your pets.\nAnd also, guests entering your home will not notice pet smells as much.\nHow to pet-proof your air purifier Here are a couple of things to do to make your air purifier 100% pet-proof.\nPositioning is Key: Place your air purifier in an area where it’s less likely to be bumped into or knocked over. This not only protects the machine but also ensures that your pet won’t be harmed if they’re too curious. For cats, consider placing the purifier on a sturdy, low table to reduce the chances of them knocking it over. For dogs, especially those with waggy tails, placing the purifier in a corner or against a wall may be beneficial. Conceal or Protect Power Cords: Many pets, especially young ones, have an affinity for chewing. Use protective sheaths or cord concealers to protect cords from curious mouths. Use Purifiers with Grilles or Mesh: If you have a pet that’s intrigued by moving parts, ensure that your air purifier has a grille or mesh that prevents paws or beaks from reaching the fan (such as the ones recommended earlier). Regular Maintenance: Pet hair and dander can accumulate in the filters more rapidly than you’d expect. Regular cleaning and replacement of filters ensure efficient operation and reduces any potential hazards from clogged filters. Stable Base: Some purifiers come with a wider base or anti-tip features. This is especially handy if you have larger pets or active pets that might knock things over during play. Noise Level: Some pets are sensitive to noise. Start the purifier on the lowest setting and observe your pet’s reaction before increasing the fan speed. How to air-purifier-proof your pet When you first introduce your air purifier into your pet’s space, be it a room your dog or cat spends a lot of time in, or an actual bird’s room dedicated to birds only, your pets will see the air purifier as an unknown object.\nHere’s how to handle the new situation:\nSlow Introduction: When introducing the air purifier, allow your pet to sniff around it when it\u0026rsquo;s turned off. Let them get used to its presence in their space before you switch it on. Associate with Positive Things: Whenever you turn on the purifier, give your pet a treat or play with them nearby. This helps them associate the sound and presence of the purifier with positive experiences. Monitor First Interactions: Watch how your pet interacts with the purifier the first few times. This helps in identifying if there are parts of the purifier that are particularly intriguing or bothersome for them. Training: For pets like dogs or parrots that can be trained, use commands like ‘no’, ‘leave it’, or ‘stay away’ if they get too curious about the purifier. Create a Barrier: If your pet remains overly curious, consider using a pet gate or pen to create a small barrier around the air purifier. Distraction: If your pet is overly focused on the air purifier, use toys or treats to distract them and redirect their attention. Conclusion All HEPA filter air purifiers are safe for pets. For dogs, cats, and most other pets, any HEPA air purifier works. For birds, I recommend getting an air purifier that creates vertical airflow.\nThe most important learning from this post:\nAlways use HEPA filter air purifiers - never use ionizers Pet-proof your air purifier by placing it out of reach and running it on low noise levels Air purifier-proof your pet through slow introduction, low fan speeds, and treats Relevant research: Indoor air pollution:\n“Respiratory health effects of indoor air pollution” ( source) “Association between indoor air pollution and respiratory disease in companion dogs and cats” ( source) Ozone-generating air purifiers:\n“Effects of an ozone-generating air purifier on indoor secondary particles in three residential dwellings” ( source) Birds:\n“Air pollution impacts on avian species via inhalation exposure and associated outcomes” ( source) “The Canary in the Coal Mine: The Sensitivity of Avian Species to Environmental Contaminants” ( source) ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-air-purifiers-safe-for-pets/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre air purifiers safe for pets? 4 months ago, my girlfriend got a puppy.

(Dogs, Cats, Birds, etc.)"},{"content":"The longevity of a 420lb propane tank varies significantly based on the heater you\u0026rsquo;re using it with.\nFor a smaller heating system, it might last you almost an entire season, but if you’re powering a strong industrial-scale heater, a 420lb propane tank can run out of gas in just a matter of days.\nQuick answer: A 420lb propane tank can last from roughly 60 hours up to an impressive 2,419 hours, depending on the heater\u0026rsquo;s BTU rating. With a standard household 9,000 BTU heater, it lasts for 805 hours (33 days) of uninterrupted heating. On the other hand, with an industrial-grade torpedo heater (120,000 BTU), it would last just about 60 hours.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s dive deeper to understand these durations.\nWhat’s the maximum fill level of a 420lb propane tank? Much like the 100lb tanks, 420lb propane tanks are not filled to their maximum capacity due to the properties of propane.\nAs the temperature fluctuates, propane expands or contracts.\nTo accommodate this change in volume and to ensure safety, propane tanks are typically filled only up to 80% of their total capacity.\nHence, a 420lb propane tank would contain up to 336lb of propane when filled to this recommended level.\nHow much energy is in a 420lb propane tank?\nUsing the known heat energy of propane, which is 21,594 BTU per pound:\n420 lb × 21,594 BTU per lb × 80% = 7,252,992 BTU\nThis value represents the total energy stored in a typically filled 420lb propane tank.\nHow much energy do various propane heaters consume? Just as we detailed in the 100lb tank post, the BTU ratings of propane heaters can be vast. From petite personal heaters to gigantic industrial units, the range is wide.\nThe table below provides a quick reference of various heater sizes and how long they would last with a 420lb tank:\nTo calculate how long a propane tank will last given a heater\u0026rsquo;s BTU/hr rating, we can use the formula:\nTank Capacity (in hours) = Total BTUs in Tank ÷ Heater\u0026rsquo;s BTU/hr\nWhere:\nThe “Total BTUs in Tank” represents the energy content of the propane in the tank. Heater\u0026rsquo;s “BTU/hr” is the rate at which the heater consumes propane. Given the total BTUs in the 420lb propane tank is 7,252,992 BTU (as derived earlier), let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the table:\n**Heating power (in BTU/h)****420 lb propane tank capacity (in hours)**3,000 BTU/h2,418 hours6,000 BTU/h1,209 hours9,000 BTU/h805 hours12,000 BTU/h604 hours15,000 BTU/h483 hours18,000 BTU/h402 hours21,000 BTU/h345 hours24,000 BTU/h302 hours27,000 BTU/h268 hours30,000 BTU/h242 hours33,000 BTU/h220 hours36,000 BTU/h201 hours39,000 BTU/h186 hours42,000 BTU/h173 hours45,000 BTU/h161 hours48,000 BTU/h151 hours51,000 BTU/h142 hours54,000 BTU/h134 hours57,000 BTU/h127 hours60,000 BTU/h121 hours90,000 BTU/h81 hours120,000 BTU/h60 hours150,000 BTU/h48 hours\nI rounded the above figures for simplicity. As you can see, the tank capacities decrease as the heating power of the device increases, which makes sense because the more gas you draw, the shorter a 420lb propane tank lasts.\nFor everyday use, you\u0026rsquo;ll most likely employ a heater with a rating around 9,000 BTU/h. Such a heater will run for 805 hours on a 420lb propane tank.\nOne example is the Mr. Heater Buddy portable propane heater.\nLarger heaters, such as vented propane heaters for garages and larger spaces consume up to 50,000 BTU per hour and more.\nPractical daily use of a 420lb propane tank Though the table illustrates how long a propane tank lasts for continuous running times, it\u0026rsquo;s rare for heaters to operate non-stop every day.\nThe following table shows how long a 420lb propane tank lasts, if you run a 9,000 BTU/h heater for just a few hours a day:\n**Daily heating duration (in hours)****How long does a 420lb propane tank last? (with a 9,000 BTU/h heater)**2 hours402 days4 hours201 days6 hours134 days8 hours100 days10 hours80 days12 hours67 days24 hours34 days\nHow to make your 420 lb propane tank last longer Increasing your propane tank’s life can be achieved through a few measures:\nAdjust the Heating: The most direct approach is to set a lower heat setting. Reducing the heating output will naturally extend the life of your propane tank.\nFor example, my Mr. Heater portable propane heater has two different heat settings, corresponding to 4,000 BTU/h and 9,000 BTU/h.\nSo, on the low setting, my propane tank lasts twice as long as on the high setting. Check for Leaks: Regularly inspect your propane tank, heater, and the connecting hose for potential gas leaks.\nAlso, I recommend getting a new propane gas hose every couple years to ensure there are no micro-leaks which you can’t detect.\nI recommend getting this PatioGem propane gas hose (click here to see it on amazon).\nThis not only ensures your safety but also makes certain that you aren’t losing gas unnecessarily. Also, I highly recommend you have a look at this article: Why is my propane heater using so much gas?\nThere, I list 8 different causes of high gas consumption and how to fix them.\nAnd additionally, you get more tips on further minimizing propane consumption through insulation.\nConclusion For a commonly used 9,000 BTU/h indoor heater, a 420lb tank can provide a full 805 hours of heating, translating to around 34 days of continuous heating.\nIn practical terms, with about 8 hours of daily heating, a 420lb propane tank can serve you for nearly three months.\nYou can maximize your tank’s longevity by ensuring you use a new hose without leaks and running your heater on moderate settings.\nAlso, check out the other posts in the series:\nHow long does a 20lb propane tank last?

In this article, we’re going to explore the art of using extension cords with air purifiers and how to stay safe at all times!\nExtension cords can pose a risk when not used appropriately. While air purifiers generally consume much less power than similar devices (such as portable air conditioners), safety precautions are still essential.\nMost extension cords can handle the little power an air purifier draws. But a very bad quality extension cord that can\u0026rsquo;t handle the required power can pose a risk of melting or even catching fire.\nThe risk with air purifiers is not the power, but the running time: Oftentimes, you run your air purifier for 4 to 8 hours a day, sometimes even longer. This can cause heat buildup.\nThat’s why you need the right-sized extension cord for your air purifier.\nQuick answer: Yes, you can use an extension cord for an air purifier. But make sure your extension cord supports the wattage and amperage of your air purifier. Otherwise, you risk a fire. Most air purifiers typically consume between 30W to 200W, translating to about 0.25 to 1.67 Amps. Your extension cord should safely accommodate this.\nNot sure if your extension cord at home can handle it? Keep reading. I will recommend a few extension cords you can buy that can handle typical currents for air purifiers.\nRecommended Extension Cord for Air Purifiers Before we dive into what makes an extension cord safe for air purifiers, I\u0026rsquo;ll share some of my personal favorite extension cords.\nFor air purifiers, I recommend this 25 ft. extension cord (click here to view it on amazon). It\u0026rsquo;s rated up to 13 Amps at 125 V. So, it supports 1625 Watts of power, more than enough for any household air purifier.\nIf you need an extension cord longer than that, consider this 50 ft. extension cord (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt’s always good to have a slightly longer cord for versatility\nBoth of these extension cords are absolutely bulletproof and 100% safe to run even the strongest air purifier.\nProbably you can also get a smaller-gauge extension cord. But I find that smaller gauges are harder to find. And, if you find one, they are neither cheaper nor do they look very trustworthy.\nSo, get a good extension cord. Then, you are also free to use that cord with any other device in the future.\nPrerequisites for Extension Cords for Air Purifiers All extension cords are not created equal. They vary in gauge (thickness of the wire) and the materials from which they\u0026rsquo;re made. Different cords are best suited for different devices.\nFor an air purifier, the extension cord must be rated to handle at least the amount of current the device uses. It\u0026rsquo;s good practice to leave some tolerance room.\nFor example, if your air purifier draws 2 Amp of current from the wall outlet, don\u0026rsquo;t opt for an exactly 2A-rated extension cord.\n( I am not sure if such small gauges even exist - at least not in the realm of extension cords )\nUsing an extension cord at its maximum limit consistently can risk damage.\nThe principle remains consistent: Always opt for safety. It\u0026rsquo;s better to invest in a quality extension cord than risk potential damage or danger.\nHow much current do Air Purifiers use? Air purifiers vary in their power consumption based on their size, capacity, and efficiency. A smaller purifier meant for a bedroom may only use 30W to 60W, while a larger unit for a spacious living room might consume 100W to 200W.\nTranslating this to current, most air purifiers draw between 0.25 to 1.67 Amps.\nHere’s how I calculated these values:\nPower Equation: The power (P) consumed by any electronic device is the product of the voltage (V) and the current (I) it draws. This relationship is given by the equation:\nP = V × I\nCommon Voltage Standard: In most households in the United States, the standard voltage is 120V. Using this standard, we can rearrange the power equation to solve for current:\nI = P ÷ V\nCalculating for Smaller Air Purifiers: Taking a smaller purifier that uses 30W as an example:\nI = 30W ÷ 120V = 0.25 A\nA 30W purifier draws a current of 0.25 Amps.\nCalculating for Larger Air Purifiers: For a larger purifier that uses 200W:\nI = 200W ÷ 120V = 1.67\nA 200W purifier draws a current of 1.67 Amps.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s essential to remember that these calculations provide a general estimate. Always refer to the specific product\u0026rsquo;s user manual or label to get the exact power and current values, as they can differ between various models and brands.\nAlways refer to your air purifier\u0026rsquo;s user manual to find its specific power and current ratings. When in doubt, it\u0026rsquo;s better to overestimate the power requirements to ensure safety.\nAir purifier peak currents on “High” fan speed Sometimes, air purifiers consume more power than their specification label indicates.\nFor example, the Levoit Core 300 (which is the air purifier I use), officially draws 33W. Here’s the proof:\nPower specs label of a regular Levoit air purifier.\nBut, according to power-meter measurements, that’s only the average wattage on the “Medium” fan speed setting.\nIf I run my air purifier at “High”, it consumes up to 47 Watts of power.\nThat’s 42% more than the specification indicates!\nSo, we have to account for that as well when using an extension cord with an air purifier.\nWhen a strong air purifier is rated at 200W, you can assume peak power usage on the highest setting to be 300W.\n( Which would draw a whopping 2.5 Amps from a US standard outlet )\nAdditional Safety Tips for Using an Extension Cord with an Air Purifier Even though most extension cords can easily handle an air purifier, you should get a quality extension cord to reduce the heat buildup. Air purifiers typically run for many hours a day, or even 24/7 . The risk is not power consumption, but running time and the corresponding heat accumulation over time.\nHere are a few things to remember when running your air purifier with an extension cord:\nUnroll the Extension Cord: This prevents heat buildup. Even if air purifiers don\u0026rsquo;t draw as much power as ACs, it\u0026rsquo;s still crucial to avoid bundling up the cord. Ensure a Proper Connection: Make sure the extension cord is firmly connected to both the air purifier and the wall outlet.\nA loose connection increases electric resistance and can result in a power cord meltdown. Choose the Right Length: An unnecessarily long cord can lead to increased resistance and potential tripping hazards. Opt for the length that suits your needs. Can you use a regular extension cord with an air purifier? Yes, you can use any regular extension cord with an air purifier. Most likely, the old leftover extension cord in your garage is capable of handling even a strong 200W air purifier.\nStill, before you use “any” extension cord, ensure it can handle the power requirements of your air purifier.\nI frequently run my air purifier with this messy surge protector (in the background). Everything works just fine.\nCheck the Amperage rating on the extension cord itself. You should find a print label on the power cord itself.\nFor most air purifiers, an extension cord rated for 3A or 5A should suffice.\nIf you don’t find a label specifying the gauge and amperage of the extension cord, I suggest you simply try to run your air purifier with the cord for a few hours in a safe place (outdoors, in a garage, etc.) to check that everything works.\nExtra safe extension Cords for heavy-duty appliances If you still are afraid of running your air purifier with a regular extension cord, you might consider an extension cord with a built-in surge protector.\nWhile not essential, it can provide additional peace of mind, especially during electrical storms or fluctuations.\nOr even better: Use a heavy-duty extension cord. My favorite heavy-duty extension cord is this Clear Power extension cord (click here to view it on amazon).\nThe best thing about these heavy-duty extension cords is that they support any electric device. You might not need them for your air purifier, but you can use them.\nAnd if you really need a heavy-duty cord one day (for example for an electric drill, a car charger, a portable air conditioner, or a space heater) you already have one at home.\nA heavy-duty extension cord is never wasted money!\nThere will always come a time when you need one.\nConclusion To conclude, using an extension cord with an air purifier is perfectly safe as long as you take the necessary precautions.\nEnsure the extension cord can handle the purifier\u0026rsquo;s power requirements, and always prioritize quality products.\nThis way, you can enjoy cleaner air without any worries.\nIf you want to be 100% safe, get a good heavy-duty extension cord. Even though a heavy-duty cord is way beyond what an air purifier needs, there will be a time in your life when you need such a heavy-duty cord anyways.\nSo, you’re versatile and already prepared!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-use-an-extension-cord-with-an-air-purifier/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you use an extension cord for an air purifier?

Whether it\u0026rsquo;s an indicator light, fan issue, or connectivity problem, we\u0026rsquo;ve got you covered.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s your comprehensive guide to troubleshooting the most common issues with Coway air purifiers.\nCoway air purifiers are incredibly overpriced.\nSo, a Coway air purifier not working is annoying and can also cut a huge hole in your wallet.\nYou probably don’t want to spend another $200 - $500 (or even up to $1,000 depending on the model) for a new Coway air purifier.\nAnd hiring someone is expensive as well.\nHow to fix Coway-specific air purifier problems Coway air purifiers have some features that regular air purifiers don’t have.\nFor example, they have built-in pollution monitoring that runs with 3 different automation modes (“smart”, “eco”, and “sleep”).\nThe Coway Airmega ProX air purifier even has two built-in fans.\n“Eco” or “Sleep” mode active If your purifier seems off or unusually quiet, it may be operating in one of these energy-saving modes.\nEnsure that the device is not set to either “Eco” or “Sleep”\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s in “Eco” mode, the purifier will turn the fan off after 30 minutes (if air pollution levels are low).\nThe “Sleep” mode, on the other hand, is designed for silent operation at night. You can manually change the mode or reset it to another preferred setting.\nHow to Fix It Ensure that your device isn\u0026rsquo;t set to either “Eco” or “Sleep”. While “Eco” mode runs the fan at reduced speeds to save energy, “Sleep” mode is tailored for quiet nighttime operation.\nYou can manually switch or reset to your preferred setting.\nAir quality indicator lit Coway\u0026rsquo;s advanced models (the Airmega 300 and 400) feature an air quality indicator that changes colors according to the quality of the surrounding air.\nIf this indicator is consistently lit, it signifies either very good (blue) or very poor (red) air quality.\nThis LED ring indicates air quality.\nIf you think the air quality indicators are not working, do the following:\nEnsure the sensors are clean, as dust accumulation might interfere with accurate readings. Regular maintenance of these sensors is crucial for optimal operation.\nHow to Fix It Keep the sensors clean, as dust can distort readings.\nRegular cleaning ensures the best performance.\nTo do so:\nLift the front cover of your Airmega 300 or 400 and, with a damp swab (according to the cleaning instructions label next to the dust sensor):\nClean the outlet Clean the lens Clean the inlet I put three big red arrows pointing, so you can\u0026rsquo;t miss them:\nCoway Mood Light turned off Some Coway models come with a mood-light feature.\nIf the light isn’t working, make sure it’s turned on in the settings.\nIf it’s on and not working, the bulb or LED might need replacement.\nHow to Fix It Ensure it\u0026rsquo;s activated. If still non-functional, the LED or bulb may need a replacement.\nPre-filter Cleaning Indicator Issue Users have reported that the indicator light that signifies the need to clean the pre-filter often doesn\u0026rsquo;t go off, even after they\u0026rsquo;ve cleaned the pre-filter multiple times.\nIn this case, you can’t really trust the accuracy of the indication and if the purifier is functioning effectively.\n\u0026ldquo;Then the light went on to clean it. Not the “replace filter”-light, but the “clean the pre-filter”-light. And I did. And the light wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go away. Did it some more. Nope. And more. Nope. Cleaned the sensor a few times. Nope. Still dirty.\u0026rdquo;\nNoodle Boodle in an amazon review of the Coway Airmega 250\nHow to Fix It Clean the pre-filters, and touch and hold the pre-filter indicator button for 2-3 seconds. This should reset the indicator.\nThe pre-filter button is this button with the text \u0026ldquo;Pre Wash\u0026rdquo; on it\nIf the pre-filter cleaning indicator issue also happens for you, possibly there is some issue with the sensor.\nThe air purifier should still work in general. This problem is merely annoying. But it does not interrupt the air purification.\nSo, you can either leave it and ignore the indicator light.\nOr you can replace the filter. Finding a replacement sensor might be hard, though.\nYou can harvest it from used, broken Coways air purifiers or maybe you can find a sensor online.\nRemote Control Issues (for models with remotes) Some Coway air purifiers come with a remote control. Of course, these can fail due to low batteries, obstructions, or sensor issues.\nHow to Fix It Replace batteries and ensure the remote\u0026rsquo;s infrared sensor is unobstructed.\nAdditionally, ensure that the remote is paired with the purifier and that there\u0026rsquo;s no interference or blockage between the remote and the purifier\u0026rsquo;s sensor.\nRemember, any solid obstacle can disrupt the remote\u0026rsquo;s functionality.\nTorn air filter The Airmegafine mesh pre-filters are designed to capture hair and heavy dust. Because Coway filters are so expensive, some people like to clean filters manually in order to reuse them.\nDue to their fine mesh, they can potentially tear if not cleaned with care.\nIf the air filter tears, it reduces the airflow resistance, which might disturb the fan’s electric control mechanism.\nHow to Fix It Avoid aggressive cleaning methods. Ideally, instead of cleaning the filters, get replacement filters.\nThey don’t have to be original. Original Coway filters are not necessarily better than other filters.\nI recommend getting these Airmega AP-1512HH replacement filters (click to view them on amazon) and these replacement filters for the larger Airmega 400 models.\nCoway doesn’t publicize its filter test data. But if we believe their marketing claims, original filters are merely 0.049% better than regular HEPA filters anyways ( source).\nReplacing filters on a Coway air purifier is easy:\n\u0026amp;ab_channel=HouseFresh\nWi-Fi Connectivity and App Issues Coway air purifiers sometimes have problems connecting to a 5GHz network.\nThe setup process doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow for direct network selection, as it defaults to the last Wi-Fi network the user was connected to, necessitating a connection to a 2.4GHz network for a smoother setup.\nAlso, the Android app version appears to be less stable than the Apple version, indicating it might have been a direct port without adequate adjustments and quality assurance for Android.\nInitial setup might require users to force restart the app to get it working properly.\nHow to Fix It Ensure you\u0026rsquo;re connected to a 2.4GHz network for a hassle-free setup. If using the Android app, force restart it for optimal functioning. An app update or patch from the manufacturer might be needed.\nCoway’s \u0026ldquo;Smart\u0026rdquo; Mode not automatically turning on the air purifier There\u0026rsquo;s a potential design flaw in the \u0026ldquo;Smart\u0026rdquo; mode feature. While it does automatically shut off to save energy under certain conditions (dark room, good air quality), it does not seem to turn itself back on when required. This defeats the purpose of a mode intended to intelligently respond to environmental conditions.\n“What\u0026rsquo;s the point of \u0026ldquo;Smart\u0026rdquo; mode if it just shuts off and will not restart again when needed?\u0026quot;\nangry reviewer\nHow to Fix It Manually intervene if the purifier doesn’t reactivate in changing environmental conditions, or avoid using \u0026ldquo;Smart\u0026rdquo; mode if this issue persists.\nBuilt-in fan rattling It can happen that your Coway air purifier\u0026rsquo;s fan begins rattling after just a month of usage. This indicates that something is seriously wrong with your fan. Possibly there’s an imbalance in the rotational axis or in the bearings.\nHow to Fix It Ensure the air purifier is on a flat, stable surface to rule out external factors causing the imbalance.\nClean the fan blades and surrounding area to remove any debris or dust that might cause the rattling.\nIf it doesn’t work still, trash the Coway air purifier and get a Levoit air purifier instead (these are my favorites).\nHow to fix non-Coway-specific air purifier problems (not turning on, fan not blowing air, weird noises, etc.) So far, we covered problems that only occur in Coway air purifiers. So, we covered mostly Coway-specific features.\nHowever, what if your air purifier simply doesn’t turn on? Or what if it turns on, but the fan doesn’t blow air.\nI’ve already covered most fixes for air purifiers not turning on in my guide: How to fix an air purifier not turning on\n( I highly recommend you read this - repair is guaranteed if you take the time, since this guide covers absolutely everything)\nAnd there are some useful fixes for noise-related problems in this guide as well: How to fix an air purifier making noise\nInstead of regurgitating everything that was said in those articles again, I highly recommend you have a look at them.\nHere is a breakdown of the most important air purifier issues:\nReasons for your Coway air purifier not turning on at all Blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker: Test: Check the electric service panels. Fix: Flip the tripped circuit breaker or replace the blown fuse. Defective wall outlet: Test: Plug the air purifier into a different outlet. Fix: Replace the faulty outlet. Faulty power cord: Test: Check by moving the cord while plugged in. Measure power arrival at the internal circuitry. Fix: Repair or replace the power cord. Power button fault: Test: Use a multimeter to check the power button’s functionality. Fix: Solder any broken connections or replace the power button. Fault in the electric circuitry: Test: Visually inspect for broken components or burn marks on the circuit board. Fix: Solder broken components back in place or replace damaged components. Remote control battery: Test: Check the remote’s infrared emission with a smartphone camera or replace the battery to test. Fix: Replace the remote’s battery. Reasons for your Coway air purifier turning on, but not blowing air Fan motor power supply not working: Test: Examine connections to the fan. Manually power the fan. Fix: Re-solder or replace defective parts. Fan is blocked: Test: Manually rotate the fan. Fix: Remove obstructions or replace the fan. Air purifier in locked mode: Test: Check if the “lock” icon is lit on the touch panel. Fix: Hold the lock icon for 10 seconds to unlock. Conclusion Some of the most common issues users face include malfunctioning modes like “Eco” or “Sleep”, persistent air quality indicator lights, and fan rattling sounds.\nFortunately, many of these problems can be addressed by ensuring correct settings and maintaining the cleanliness of sensors.\nIf can’t fix the problem, I recommend you get a new air purifier. This time, get a Levoit or Germ Guardian over a Coway.\nThese are just as good and cost you just a fraction!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-a-coway-air-purifier-not-working/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eExperiencing problems with your Coway air purifier?

And no HVAC company is safe from my bare honesty!\nAfter roasting Dyson cooling fans, today is the day where we check Coway Airmega air purifiers together and whether they are worth their cost.\nAnd instead of checking the specs one by one (as 99% of product reviewers do), we’re going to check\nwhether Coway lies and uses marketing tricks how Coway Airmega compares to other (regular) air purifiers if buying a Coway Airmega is worth it Coway Airmega air purifiers come in different sizes.\nThere’s the Airmega 200M, 300, 400, and ProX(click to view them on amazon), and many more (each model getting more expensive, ranging from $200 to $400 and up to over $800).\nCoway Airmega air purifier marketing claims (myth busted) All Coway Airmega models have one thing in common: A huge set of marketing claims.\nAnd it looks like Coway copy-pastes these marketing claims from sales page to sales page.\nThey merely adjust the coverage area.\nThat’s it.\nSo, let’s have a look at some of Coway’s marketing claims and see if they hold any substance.\nWhat the heck is a binary motor? The first thing I noted looking at the Coway Airmega ProX was Coway advertising a “binary” motor.\nSo, what the heck is a binary motor?\nAs an electrical engineer, I’ve never heard of that term.\nAfter checking Coway’s official ProX product page, I saw a simple image of the Airmega ProX containing two fans.\n“Wow, that’s great. Doesn’t that mean that it has twice the air purification power?”\nNo!\nHaving two built-in fans does not improve air purification. What matters is the built-in fan’s airflow. And the more power your air purifier has, the more airflow it provides.\nAs simple as that.\nSo, I decided to check the ProX technical specs and saw that it consumes 65W of power.\nThat’s nothing special. It does not matter whether an air purifier has two fans consuming a total of 65W of power, or a single fan, consuming that much power.\nIn fact, I’d argue a single fan might even be better since there are fewer moving parts (so, less chance of anything breaking) and less internal friction which causes power loss.\nThe binary motor is merely a cost choice. Most likely, Coway Airmega ProX reuses the fans from the smaller Airmega 300 and 400 models. Since the Airmega ProX needs something to “stand out”, Coway decided to use two fans and run each on reduced power.\nAnd here’s the funniest part: The Coway Airmega ProX does not even create more airflow than the Airmega 400, which consumes a similar 64W - 67W max.\nSo, there is absolutely nothing that makes a binary motor better than a single motor.\nCoway Airmega “binary” motors are pointless. They don’t improve air purification.\nThe “Designed to clean spaces up to … sq. ft.”-claim Every single Amazon Coway air purifier sales page starts with listing the “Coverage within 30 mins” as the most important first bullet point.\nApparently, that’s the room size a Coway air purifier can clean within 30 minutes of running.\nNow, let me list the coverage areas and the power consumption of a few Coway Airmega models. Something interesting is going on there:\n**Air Purifier model****Coverage area in 30 mins (in sq. ft.)****Power consumption (in Watts)**Coway Airmega 200M874 sq. ft.82 W (?)Coway Airmega 3001,256 sq. ft.57 WCoway Airmega 4001,560 sq. ft.66 WCoway Airmega ProX2,126 sq. ft.65 W (?)\nI’ve ordered the air purifiers by their coverage area. Now take a look at the power consumption (according to official Coway specs):\nThe Airmega 200M air purifier has the smallest coverage area and consumes the most power.\nMeanwhile, the Coway Airmega ProX allegedly covers an area of 2,126 sq. ft., while consuming less power than both the Airmega 200M and 400.\nTo me, this is counterintuitive. To cover larger areas, you need a higher airflow which directly translates to more power.\nSo, two things are likely going on here:\nEither Coway makes up the coverage area ratings, or the power specification is not correct. In either case, the customer is deceived.\nA third (unlikely) scenario is possible as well:\nThe ratings are correct, and the (small) Airmega 200M consumes 26% more power than the large ProX while covering a 59% smaller area because it is incredibly inefficient.\nCoway’s Dual Suction Purification The larger Coway Airmega models (300, 400, and ProX) advertise “Dual Suction Purification”.\nSounds fancy, but, in the end, the “dual suction purification” just means that there are two built-in filters: one on each side of the air purifier.\nOn Coway’s ProX product page, I find the following statement:\n“Dual-sided air intake pulls in contaminated air and pushes filtered air out to the top of the unit, cleaning the air you breathe faster and more efficiently.”\nProX product page\nSo, how do these “dual suction” air intakes help purification? Coway claims they are “cleaning the air [\u0026hellip;] faster and more efficiently”.\nAgain, this is a plain marketing statement.\nPhysically, it does not matter how many filters an air purifier has. The only factors for purification are (1) the total surface area of the filters, which determines the airflow resistance, and (2) the fan’s power consumption.\nAccordingly, a strong fan that blows air through a large filter does a better purification job than a weak fan forcing air through a small filter.\nThe physics are so simple…\nSo, I have to admit: Technically, dual filters are a good thing since they decrease airflow resistance.\nBut this reduction in airflow resistance does not stem from the “dual” filters, but rather from the simple increase in filter area.\nCoway’s double air intake is physically a good thing. I don’t like the imprecision they use in their marketing, however.\nA better statement would be “Dual air intakes improve airflow”.\nThe largest downside of dual filters There’s one thing I seriously don’t like about dual filters: Two filters cause “dual” replacement filter costs.\nWe will check the cost of replacement filters later. It’s horrible.\nIs the HyperCaptive filtration system any good? Coway advertises a HyperCaptive filtration system.\nHere’s what they say:\n“Coway’s network of diverse capture technologies takes purification to the next level, trapping and deactivating an unprecedented 99.999%¹ of particles down to 0.01 µm - smaller than most bacteria and viruses.”\nAirmega 300 product page\nLet’s break this marketing claim down and check the facts:\nTrapping an unprecedented 99.999% of particles Claiming to trap an unprecedented 99.999% of particles is one thing. But it is misleading.\nIn one study, researchers tested the particle collection efficiencies of HEPA filters with varying particle sizes.\nHere’s the result:\nAs you can see, the filtration efficiency is above 99.999%(for a regular HEPA filter) for particles smaller than 40nm and larger than 0.3µm.\nAt around 100nm, there is a minimum filtration efficiency of around 99.95%.\nAnd that’s what Coway is actually advertising:\nThey are saying:\n“In the worst possible range, where HEPA filters have “problems” picking up particles, we at Coway are doing 0.049% better.”\nreformulated actual Coway marketing statement (by me)\nBut of course, you don’t see them advertising this. Because it sounds pointless.\nThere is no reason to pay hundreds of dollars extra on a Coway Airmega air purifier (as compared to a regular air purifier) to justify 0.049% better performance for particles between 40nm and 300nm.\nAdditionally, I checked Coway’s disclaimers to see how they measured the 99.999% filtration efficiency: no study linked.\nEven though they put the superscript 1 (¹) after their claim (“99.999% ¹”), which indicates that there is data to back this claim up:\nNothing.\nAll I see is:\n“Coway air purifiers has been proven to trap dust, pollen, dander, viruses and bacteria in the air based on KCL (Korea Conformity Laboratories) testing.\u0026quot;\ndisclaimer section of Coway products\nThe testing standard is called “SPS-KACA 002”.\nHere’s what the only dust chamber testing for that standard looks like:\nHuanyi Chamber (Hong Kong) - Did Coway test their filters here?\nOne interesting thing I found here: The Huanyi testing chamber website describes the testing process. Here’s what they say is one testing step:\nTest step in Chinese testing facility: “Measure the reduction of particles with a particle size of 0.3µm”\nTo me, that sounds as if the testing procedure covers only 0.3µm particles.\nSo, what is going on? Coway links no test data validating their marketing claims.\nAll I can tell is that there have been tests, likely in Hong Kong, and we don’t get access to the actual test results.\nMerely a claim.\nAnd even if that claim was true, it’s just a 0.049% improvement over the standard.\nTrapping and Deactivating particles Coway’s filters trap and deactivate particles. Sounds nice!\nIt suggests that after trapping, their HEPA filters have some additional mechanism to “kill” particles.\nOf course, that is physically not possible. And I strongly wonder what Coway means by “deactivating”.\nHere’s what is actually going on in a HEPA filter:\nHEPA filters catch particles based on 4 different mechanisms:\nDiffusion: tiny particles shaking around in the air stream until the filter catches them by chance Interception: a particle bumps directly into the filter Inertial impaction: a heavy particle can’t follow the airstream (passing through the gaps in the filter) and bumps into the filter Electrostatic attraction: a particle bumps into the filter because of an electric charge All of these are different forms of “one particle bumps into the filter for whatever reason”.\nAside from trapping particles, there is no further mechanism in a HEPA filter.\nA HEPA filter does not “deactivate” anything.\nSuspiciously, there is no disclaimer about the deactivation part of Coway’s marketing statement.\nThis is a plain lie.\nReadvertising the same function as different features Coway Airmega air purifiers have built-in air pollution monitoring. They call it “24/7 air pollution monitoring”.\nThe “24/7” is redundant. Any electric device is a 24/7 device if I run it for 24 hours a day.\nFor example, my fridge is a 24/7 fridge. Just as my smoke detector is a 24/7 smoke detector.\nIt makes no sense.\nOn top of that, anything other than 24/7 would make pollution monitoring pointless. Why should it ever turn off? It’s a monitoring mechanism.\nImagine your home’s smoke detector turns of at certain hours.\nThis way, Coway makes something usual sound like it’s something special.\nBut that’s not it.\nThe 24/7 air pollution monitoring is “saving [you] energy when [the air purifier] is not needed”.\nWhen pollution levels are down, the air purifier turns off.\nNice. This adaptive air pollution-based airspeed control makes sense. Coway calls this “Smart Mode” (There is nothing smart about a regular electrical control circuit by the way. They are used everywhere).\nBut Coway apparently can’t stop there.\nThey have to bloat it (again):\nNow, on top of the air pollution-based “Smart Mode”, the Coway Airmega air purifiers have two more modes:\n“Eco Mode”: Monitors air pollution and turns the fan on or off accordingly “Sleep mode”: Monitors air pollution and adjusts fan speed when it’s dark In principle, all those three different modes do the same thing. “Smart Mode”, “Eco Mode”, and “Sleep Mode” all monitor air pollution and set the fan accordingly.\nThere are some slight differences. But is it really necessary to bloat these features up so much that they make up more than half of the product description on Amazon?\nCan’t you just say “Air pollution monitoring and automated fan speed control modes”?\nI mean it’s nice that Coway Airmega air purifiers monitor pollution levels. But they absolutely oversell it.\nUsually, it’s enough to just run your air purifier all the time and adjust settings as you need. Air purifiers consume next to no power, so adaptive air purification does not make that much sense.\nGas and odor removal Coway claims it removes 99% of Food smells, Cigarette odors, VOCs, Pet odors, and dander.\nLuckily this claim refers to a disclaimer, so I can check it.\nAnd, interestingly:\n“The concentration of ammonia, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid were proven to be removed [\u0026hellip;] It is not a demonstration result in the actual use space. Not all odors and gases may be supported.”\nAirmega 400 disclaimer section\nExplanation:\nCoway tested for 3 types of gases (ammonia, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid). But these chemicals are not directly related to their marketing claims.\nCoway claims that the Airmega models remove everyday smells. But they test it in a lab, with unrelated test tube chemicals. Not very authentic.\nCoway claims to remove 99% of food smells, cigarette odors, VOCs, and pet odors. But they did not perform any experiments to validate their claims.\nInterestingly they say this result does not demonstrate how the Coway Airmega works in the actual “use space” (at your home).\nSo, they admit that their claim has no direct backing.\nWhat’s particularly bad about Coway Airmega air purifiers So far, we checked the Coway Airmega series’ marketing claims. And, to be honest, I am seriously disappointed.\nBut it gets way worst. Let’s have a look at what’s particularly bad about Coway Airmega air purifiers outside of their marketing claims.\nCoway Airmega 300 and 400 stand on feet (elevated) The Coway Airmega 300 and 400 models have attached feet to stand on.\nThese may look nice but actually have a negative impact on dust collection.\nAn air purifier should always stand close to the ground to create an air draft along the floor. This allows the air purifier to pick up dust particles that already settled on the ground.\nThe higher an air purifier stands on its feet, the higher it has to lift these settled particles, and the harder it gets to do so.\nAn air purifier standing on its feet can’t effectively pick up floor dust.\nIn principle, that’s not a critical problem, since you bought an air purifier and not a vacuum. But I like the idea of my air purifier also picking up dust from the floor.\nWhy should you inhibit this functionality by placing your air purifier on feet? There’s no reason.\nAnd if I spend $500 on a Coway Airmega 300 or 400, I want it to pick up all the particles in my home. Not just those floating around in the air.\nFilter replacement costs Coway’s replacement filter costs are absolutely infuriating.\nOne set of non-original replacement filters costs about $50.\nAir Purifier ModelOriginal replacement filter costCoway Airmega 300$99Coway Airmega 400$129Coway Airmega ProX$199\nOriginal Coway Airmega replacement filters cost up to $199. What a rip-off!\nThankfully, they advertise you get a “20% off filters coupon with registration”. So, after you provide them with your valuable data (so they can send you advertising emails), they will sell you a filter for $160 instead of $199.\nHow nice…\nSuch a filter costs very little in production. Coway blows up filter replacement prices artificially. No HEPA filter is worth $99 - $199.\nThese price politics show how Coway tries to position itself: as a luxury air purifier brand.\nSimilar to how original luxury car part prices go totally overboard, Coway blows up their replacement part prices.\nAfter all, once you buy a $500 - $1,000 Coway Airmega air purifier, they expect you to not bother paying up to $99 - $199 for replacement filters.\nCoway Airmega target customer demography Checking all the prices on Coway’s website unveiled one more detail I want to share with you.\nBelow every price on Coway’s website, they advertise picking up debt (through monthly payments) in order to afford them.\nHere’s an example for ProX replacement filters:\nReplacement filter price of the Airmega ProX.\nApparently, Coway markets their luxury Airmega air purifiers to people who can’t afford them.\nWhy is that?\nBecause Coway Airmega air purifiers are not actually luxury items. Based on the myth-busting checks earlier, we can now tell that Coway Airmega air purifiers are mostly regular air purifiers.\nThey have a couple of additional features here and there. But overall, there is nothing inherently, technically special about a Coway Airmega air purifier.\nTo not have to compete with other technically sound and reasonably priced air purifier brands such as Levoit or Germ Guardian, Coway positions itself in a higher price category with much less competition.\nTheir mantra is that finding one person naive enough to pay $500 - $1,000 for a regular air purifier is easier and more profitable than competing with other air purifier brands in a lower price category.\nIf Coway really tried to create luxury items, they would build aluminum casings with a nice finish. They’d have perfectly balanced and maintenance-free steel fans. And they’d invest in actual research to back up their purification claims about their filters.\nCoway Airmega air purifiers are not luxury products. They are regular plastic air purifiers with regular HEPA filters.\nOnly their price tag is luxury.\nWhat I like about Coway Airmega air purifiers After all this critique, there is one thing that Coway does well.\nAir pollution monitoring I particularly like the air pollution monitoring that comes with Coway Airmega air purifiers.\nThat’s a neat feature.\nAnd I truly wonder why not all air purifiers have this.\nAfter all, a cheap Chinese air pollution sensor costs under $2. So, air purifier production costs would not increase much.\nThe air pollution monitoring ensures that your air purifier only runs when it’s necessary. For example, I can imagine a Coway Airmega adjusting fan speed when you run it with a window open, or when you’re cooking.\nAir pollution monitoring does not save you much money. After all, running an air purifier costs under $0.01 per hour.\nSo, reducing fan speed by 30% because air pollution is reduced as well, does not save you much financially.\nBut as an engineer, I vouch for the principle of only running a device when it’s needed.\nAfter all, it’s not only about saving money (although Coway advertises it as a power-saving feature), but also about less noise and less airflow at home.\nWhat’s the best Coway Airmega alternative? Coway Airmega air purifiers are heavily overpriced and ethically and scientifically questionable. Still, they are technically solid air purifiers.\nHere are a few alternatives I’d recommend you buy over a Coway Airmega any time:\nLevoit Core air purifiers Personally, I like the Levoit Core air purifiers a lot. They are sound devices, have great filters, and are much more reasonably priced.\nInstead of a Coway Airmega 300 or 400, I recommend getting the Levoit Core 400S(click here to view it on amazon).\nIt also has a built-in air pollution sensor and you can monitor the pollution level changes on your smartphone!\nThe Core 400 cleans more air than the Airmega 300 or 400 (according to Levoit’s and Coway’s official numbers) and costs just a fraction of the Airmega’s price.\nPersonally, I have the Levoit Core 300 (click to see my review) and I really dig its simplicity. It’s a high-quality device, with all the features I need (different fan settings, good filter, quiet mode), but not going overboard with automated “smart”, “eco” and whatever modes I’ll never use.\nFor larger spaces, and for a truly luxurious feel, you can also get the larger Levoit Core 600 (click here to view it on amazon).\nThe Core 600 is the best alternative for a Coway Airmega ProX air purifier. It’s strong and has a PM2.5 particle monitor (just like the ProX) but costs just a fraction of the ProX.\nOf course, the Core 600 also has automatic modes where it monitors air pollution and adjusts fan speed accordingly.\nThere is virtually no drawback to getting a Levoit Core 600 over the expensive Coway Airmega ProX.\nConclusion: Are Coway Airmega Air Purifiers worth it? Coway Airmega air purifiers are heavily overpriced and cost 2-3 times what comparable air purifiers cost.\nTechnically, there is no reason to buy a Coway Airmega air purifier:\nCoway Airmega air purifiers don’t filter air significantly better than other air purifiers. Coway markets its air purifiers to people who can’t afford them. They can’t back up their claims with actual public data. This is something I would expect at this price point. You should buy a Coway Airmega air purifier only if you have a lot of money to waste and you dig the look and feel of Coway Airmega air purifiers.\nHowever, if you want to get an air purifier for air purification only, I recommend getting a Levoit or Germ Guardian air purifier. They are reasonably priced.\nCoway’s air purifiers don’t work any better than other good-quality air purifiers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-coway-airmega-air-purifiers-worth-it/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre Coway Airmega air purifiers worth it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you know one thing about me, it’s most likely that I absolutely can’t stand overpriced garbage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one of the worst things for me is seeing family and friends fall for marketing hoaxes … So, I hope I can at least save \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e, dear reader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name is Daniel, I am an electrical and aerospace engineer.

I bought an air purifier to get the exact opposite result!\nYou just don’t buy an air purifier to make things smell worse.\nJust like you don’t eat food to get more hungry. And you don’t buy a car to drive you farther away from your destination.\nWhat causes an air purifier to smell bad?\nHere’s one complaint I found online:\n“I got an automatic air purifier. In fact, this is my second unit because I thought the first was defective - but when I run this $700 air purifier it smells! It has some kind of semi-chemical smell.”\nBarcino from the mothering forum\nBut are these smells normal?\nIn this article, we’re going to cover a couple of different topics.\nFirst, some types of air purifiers naturally emit smells. You perceive them as chemical smells. That’s normal.\nThen, some types of filters can smell. We’re going to have a look at those as well.\nAnd once you know you have neither a smelly filter nor a smelly air purifier type and your air purifier shouldn’t smell, we’re going to check ALL of the different air purifier smells and how to fix them!\nAir purifiers that smell: Ionizers and ozone generators “Is it ionic? [Ionizers] smell rather unpleasant to me but it is how they are supposed to smell.”\nmothering forum member\nIn this section, my goal is to make sure that your air purifier is not expected to smell.\nTwo kinds of air purifiers produce smells: Ionizers and ozone generators.\n“Ozone, a lung irritant, is produced indirectly by ion generators and some other electronic air cleaners and directly by ozone generators.”\nepa.gov\nThe smell of ozone is similar to the smell of a thunderstorm or “clean” air. Some people don\u0026rsquo;t like this smell because it can come off as metallic or too sharp.\nSo:\nIs your air purifier an ionizer or an ozone generator?\n( You can check this online, in the user manual, or on the packaging )\nIf yes, it naturally produces a smell.\nHowever, if you have a regular HEPA / activated carbon / UV light filter, it should not smell!\nAir purifier smells and how to get rid of them 1. Musty Smell A musty smell coming from your air purifier can come from excess moisture which causes mold growth inside your air purifier.\nYou shouldn’t run your air purifier in humid places such as in a bathroom after showering, or next to a humidifier.\nHEPA filters absorb water droplets in the air. Combine that with all the bacteria, dust, and pollen on the filter, and mold grows.\nHow to get rid of the musty air purifier smell To get rid of the musty smell your air purifier emits, replace the HEPA filter with a new one.\nIt’s not enough to shake out or brush surface dust off the dirty filter.\nIdeally, also clean the filter slot of your air purifier (the space where you insert the filter) with rubbing alcohol, vinegar, or a similar cleaner.\nLet your air purifier air out and dry.\nInsert your new replacement filter.\nThe musty smell should be gone.\n2. Plastic Smell New air purifiers often smell like plastic, because of off-gassing. According to a report published in Environmental Science \u0026amp; Technology ( Hodgson et al., 2002), common household items (including office equipment, carpeting, and, in this case, air purifiers) can emit a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including formaldehyde, toluene, and other potentially harmful chemicals.\nThese VOCs are what you perceive as a plastic smell.\nHow to get rid of your air purifier’s plastic smell In general, it’s enough to let your air purifier air out.\nRun it for a couple of days. You can also place it outdoors.\nIf you want, you can wet wipe your air purifier using just water. Do not add any cleaning products, since they may react with the plastic gases coming from your air purifier.\nThe plastic smell is temporary and should subside soon.\n3. Sweet Smell A sweet smell coming from a new air purifier or a new filter is normal! Personally, I perceive the smell from a brand-new HEPA filter as slightly sweet.\nBut I like it and it’s not unusual.\nAfter a couple of days of running your air purifier, the sweet smell reduces.\nIf, however, your old filter starts smelling sweet, this can have the following reasons:\nHow to get rid of sweet smells in an air purifier Stop using perfumes, room deodorants, or scented candles nearby: Normally, air purifiers are able to filter out scents. A working HEPA + activated carbon filter should not emit any smells. However, if smells settle on the inside of the filter, the filtered clean air passes over the scent molecules and carries them back into the room.\nReplace the filter: Often, a sweet smell could be a result of your filter absorbing chemicals from your environment, such as from freshly painted rooms. To solve this, simply replace the filter in your unit. 4. Wet Dog Smell Weg dog smell does not necessarily come from your dog’s hair being stuck in the filter.\nCertainly, this can be the cause. But it’s not necessary.\nWet dog smell usually comes from a combination of dust, hair, and moisture.\nHow to remove dog smell in an air purifier The safest way to get rid of the dog smell in your air purifier is to replace the filter.\nTo prevent the smell from returning, place your air purifier away from humidity coming from the bathroom or kitchen and run it in a dry place such as your living room.\nAlso, you can place the air purifier on an elevated surface to reduce the amount of dog hair getting into it.\nTo reduce pet dander in your living space, vacuuming is better than air purifying.\nAir purifiers are good at keeping spaces clean, but not at cleaning them.\n5. Burning / Smoke Smell A burning smell coming from your air purifier can come from a part in the electronic circuitry or from a broken fan.\nPossibly your air purifier is about to break:\nHowever, in general, air purifiers don’t break easily. They are low-power devices and have only very few components that can break.\nHow to remove burning smell in an air purifier If you think your air purifier is about to break, inspect your air purifier’s internal hardware and electronics components.\nTo do that check my air purifier repair guide and my air purifier noise fixing guide (in case your air purifier makes strange noises in addition to smelling like burning).\nAfter reading these two articles, you’ll know how to fix any air purifier problem.\nAnother potential cause could be a saturated (smoke) filter that can’t hold on to smoke particles anymore.\nThe filter might absorb the smoke smell for a while but releases it shortly after.\nIn this case, I recommend also replacing the filter with a new HEPA filter.\n6. Paint Smell Many of the smells coming from an air purifier at some point got into the air purifier.\nMost likely that’s the case for your air purifier. Many people use air purifiers to filter paint smells.\nAnd some are so bold, they get a new air purifier, use it during their renovation, and return it afterward.\nSo, when you buy a used air purifier, possibly it is loaded with smell molecules from strangers.\nHow to fix your air purifier smelling like paint The only way to get rid of the paint smell is to replace the HEPA filter.\nIf you bought your air purifier new and it smells like paint, probably it’s just off-gassing. In this case, just give it time.\n7. Fishy Smell Interestingly, a fishy smell does not necessarily come from waste or fish. Many electronic components smell fishy.\nIf your air purifier emits a strong fishy smell, watch out and keep checking that your air purifier works.\nFailing electric components are usually not dangerous since air purifiers run on very low wattages.\nSo, don’t worry about it until your air purifier actually stops blowing air.\nHow to get rid of a fishy smell coming from your air purifier To fix the fishy smell your air purifier emits, I recommend you check out my air purifier fixing guide (linked earlier).\nPossibly you have to replace an electric component.\nOr if you don’t have the knowledge and skills to fix it, get a new one.\nI recommend the Levoit Core 300 (click to see my review). It does not smell at all!\n8. Cigarette Smell A distinct cigarette smell (in contrast to general smoke or burning smell) obviously comes from smoking nearby the air purifier.\nAir purifiers normally eliminate cigarette smells. However, when you smoke while the air purifier is not running, cigarette smoke can settle on the inside of your air purifier’s filter.\nSo, clean air passing through the air purifier (entering from the outside), has to pass through the cigarette smoke-covered layer.\nHow to get rid of cigarette smell coming from your air purifier To eliminate the cigarette smell coming from your air purifier, just run it longer.\nAlso, always run your air purifier while you’re smoking.\nThis way, due to the airstream, smoke can’t enter your air purifier without being filtered.\nAfter a few days of running your air purifier for 8 hours a day, the odor should reduce.\nIf that doesn’t help, replace the HEPA filter with a new one!\nDiscuss how this smell can be from the air purifier processing tobacco smoke. Suggest regular filter changes and consider activated carbon filters for better removal of smoke particles.\n9. Chlorine Smell Chlorine smell can theoretically come from your tap water if you use a humidifier-type air purifier.\nOr possibly what you perceive as chlorine smell is actually ozone (which we discussed earlier).\nIf you use an ionizer-type air purifier, it definitely is ozone.\nHow to fix the chlorine smell coming from your air purifier HEPA filter air purifiers never smell like chlorine. In fact, they usually are odorless.\nIf you have an ionizer or even an ozone generator, get a regular HEPA-filter air purifier, and don’t look back.\n10. Dust Smell When your air purifier’s filter is full, it possibly smells like dust. This is usually the case in dry regions. In humid regions, it’s usually a musty smell.\nHow to fix your air purifier’s dusty smell Replace your air purifier’s filter and put in a new one.\nIn the future, don’t run your filter until it smells. Normally, HEPA filters last 6 months. After that, their dust-collection efficiency decreases by 50% (!).\nSo, HEPA filters stop working well before your senses start noticing.\n11. Food Smell Food smells usually come from the kitchen. Especially, when kitchen aerosols (oils, waste, etc.) enter the air outflow opening of your air purifier.\nIf these particles settle there, all the air your filter cleans passes through kitchen grease, which makes the whole purification process pointless.\nHow to fix food smell in an air purifier If you use your air purifier in a kitchen, always run it while you’re cooking to prevent particles from entering the wrong opening of the air purifier.\nTo get rid of the food smell now, replace the HEPA filter.\nIn the future, always run your air purifier while you’re cooking. Ideally, combine the air purification with an open window to vent the greasy gases out and reduce your air purifier’s load.\nConclusion Unless you’re using an ionizing air purifier that indirectly creates ozone, air purifiers should never smell.\nA smelly HEPA filter-based air purifier indicates either that you don’t run your air purifier while cooking, smoking, etc., or you don’t replace filters often enough.\nHEPA filters stop being effective well before you notice it. After only 6 months, they’re only 50% effective.\nSo, they pick up only half of the particles a new air purifier filter would pick up.\nThat’s a huge difference!\nAfter 6 months, a HEPA filter merely picks up moisture and dust, both of which result in a musty, wet dog smell.\nAnd on top of that, at that point, most filters stop removing odors.\nNothing pleasurable.\nSo, replace your air purifier’s filters and you’re good to go!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/why-your-air-purifier-smells/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhy does my air purifier smell musty, like plastic, sweet, or even like a wet dog?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat seems like a bad plot in a poor comic.

In this article, we’re going to check all the possible reasons and how to fix them.\nHaving clean and fresh air is important for your well-being. And air purifiers are supposed to remove odors. Or are they?\n( There will be a surprising answer to this question - not all air purifiers can remove odors )\nIf you stick out until the end of this article, you’ll know exactly why your air purifier does not remove bad smells.\nWe’ll have a look at different types of air purifiers and whether they can remove odors.\nDon’t worry if you find out your air purifier doesn’t remove odors! At the end of this post, I recommend you a good air purifier that definitely removes odors.\nQuick answer: Your air purifier does not remove odors, because it lacks an activated carbon filter. If it has an activated carbon filter, make sure to run your air purifier long enough (8 hours). Also, replace filters. And remove the source of the smell.\nBefore we take the deep dive, let’s first check the most fundamental question:\nIs your air purifier even capable of removing odors? This question might seem counterintuitive. After all, isn\u0026rsquo;t that what air purifiers are made for?\nTo cleanse the air?\nHowever, not all air purifiers are created equal, and some are better equipped to handle odors than others. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at the different types of air purifiers and whether they are able to remove bad smells.\nHEPA Filter Air Purifiers HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters are well-known for their ability to capture microscopic particles, including allergens like dust, pollen, and pet dander.\nHowever, when it comes to odors, pure HEPA filters alone are not very effective.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re designed to filter particles from 0.1 microns and larger. Some HEPA filters can even filter smaller particles.\nBut gases (which create odors) are a whole different size class. Gases are tiny molecules. They are just a thousandth of the size of the smallest particle, a HEPA filter can reliably filter.\nThese gases can easily slip through HEPA filters due to their small size. For odor removal, an air purifier with an activated carbon filter would be more effective.\nPlease note: If you bought an air purifier with a HEPA filter, it might contain a layer of an activated carbon filter. In this case, it CAN remove odors! (We will see how you can check this later)\nActivated Carbon Filters Activated carbon filters are, just like HEPA filters, airflow-based. So, air passes through them.\nActivated carbon has an incredibly high surface area of up to 3,000m² per gram, which makes these filters “sticky” for gas molecules.\nHere are a few examples of smelly gases activated carbon can removes:\nHydrogen Sulfide (H2S): This is the gas often responsible for the foul smell of rotten eggs and sewage. It has a size of approximately 0.36 nanometers and bonds strongly to carbon filters. Methanethiol (CH3SH): This is a gas that contributes to the smell of decomposing vegetables and bad breath. Its size is approximately 0.4 nanometers. Methanethiol also sticks to carbon filters. Ammonia (NH3): Often associated with the smell of urine or cleaning products, it has a size of approximately 0.26 nanometers. Activated carbon filters reduce ammonia by up to 94.4%. Activated carbon filters remove odors better than any other filter type.\nIonizers Ionizers are a special kind of air purifier, which release charged particles (ions) into the air.\nThe charge causes these particles to clump together with other particles in the air and causes them to fall down.\nIonizers don’t remove odors. Even though they can ionize molecules in the air, this doesn’t mean these molecules lose their bad smell.\nUV Light Purifiers UV purifiers use ultraviolet light to kill microorganisms like bacteria and viruses. While this is highly effective for sterilization, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any direct effect on odors since UV light doesn\u0026rsquo;t interact with gas molecules.\n( At least not in a way that removes them )\nOzone Generators Ozone generators produce ozone, a gas that can neutralize odors.\nIf you use an ozone generator at home, it should be able to reduce odors. However, it’s very unhealthy for humans.\n“There is evidence to show that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is not effective at removing many odor-causing chemicals.”\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency\nLikely, this means that at concentrations that are higher than public health standards, ozone does remove odors.\n( Of course, an environmental protection agency wants you to reduce ozone emissions )\nHowever, they are generally not recommended for home use because ozone can be harmful to health, especially in high concentrations.\nPECO / PCO Filters Photo Electrochemical Oxidation (PECO) and Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) Filters filters use light to trigger a chemical reaction that breaks down particles, including VOCs (volatile organic compounds) which are often the source of odors.\nPECO filters are effective at removing odors.\nSo, is your air purifier capable of removing odors? It all depends on the filter and air purifier type:\n**Air Purifier Filter Type****Can it remove odors?**HEPA FilterNo, except it’s a combined HEPA + carbon filterActivated Carbon FilterYesIonizersNoUV Light PurifiersNoOzone GeneratorsYes, but not recommended due to health risksPECO/PCO FiltersYesOdor removal effectiveness of different air purifier filters: Activated carbon and PECO filters are best. Ozone generators work, but can be unhealthy (hence the warning sign).\nWhich air purifier filter do you need for odor removal? The best air purifier filter type for removing odor is activated carbon.\nSince most likely you run an air purifier with a built-in HEPA filter, I recommend replacing the HEPA-only filter with a HEPA + activated carbon combined filter.\nFor example, for the Levoit Core 300 air purifier, I recommend getting this HEPA + activated carbon filter(click here to view it on amazon).\nBut pay attention:\nMany air purifiers already have combined HEPA + activated carbon filters built-in by default.\nHere are some air purifier brands that are equipped with combined filters:\nLevoit Germ Guardian Winix Blueair ( and many more … ) If you don’t know whether your air purifier has a combined HEPA + activated carbon filter, II recommend looking for original replacement filters online.\nUsually, you’ll find the word “carbon” on the sales page.\nAlternatively, you can take out your air purifier’s filter and check for a black layer. Here’s what my filter with activated carbon looks like:\nThe inner filtering layer contains hundreds of black pieces. That\u0026rsquo;s the activated carbon.\nOther common reasons for your air purifier not removing odor In the previous section, we made sure you have an air purifier that is capable of removing odor, to begin with.\nBut there are a couple more potential causes for your air purifier not removing odor. Let’s have a look.\nToo small air purifier You air purifier may simply be too small for your space. If you run your air purifier in a large room, such as a living room, it can make sense to get a dedicated, more powerful air purifier for that room.\nFor living rooms, get at least the Levoit Core 400 (click here to view it on amazon) or larger.\nThis air purifier is powerful and it has a built-in combined HEPA and activated carbon filter.\nSo, it will remove both smells and particles.\nWorn-out / clogged filters You have to replace your air purifier filters every 6 months! After 6 months HEPA filter particle reduction efficiency reduces to just 50%.\nSo, after 6 months of usage, a filter can only collect half of the particles a new filter could collect.\nFor removing smells, make sure you get a HEPA + activated carbon filter! (Preferably original)\nAir purifier running not long enough Air purifiers need time to absorb odors. I’ve seen some air purifier companies advertise something along the lines of “this air purifier filters your room’s air 3 times per hour”.\nThat is obviously nonsense.\nAn air purifier pulls in that volume of air per hour, yes. But that doesn’t mean that it pulls in only “dirty” air. To a large portion, it filters air it already cleaned.\nMeanwhile, some stale air zones in your room are hard to reach for your air purifier. And possibly that’s where the odors reside.\nIt takes time for your air purifier to really filter all the air in your room. So, run it longer!\nI suggest 8 hours per day.\n( Air purifier running cost is very low, so don’t worry about it )\nAir purifier does not clean the source of the smell Air purifiers with built-in activated carbon filters remove smelly gases from the air in your room.\nHowever, if you don’t remove the source of the odor, no air purifier can keep up with it.\nFor example, rotten food, litter, etc.\nAll these things need to go out of your house and into the trash!\nHow to improve air purifier odor removal effectiveness You now already know which air purifiers (and which filters) to use to get rid of odors. Also, you know the things not to do.\nHere’s a quick action list based on what we already discussed:\nUse a strong, well-sized air purifier (with a built-in HEPA + activated carbon filter) Replace filters (this can make a huge difference) Run your air purifier for longer times Clean the sources of odors If you can tick the boxes of all 4 checkpoints, you should be able to get rid of most odors in your home.\nBefore we have a look at a couple more key-strategies to remove smells in your home, here’s one important learning:\nAir purifiers never remove all smells\nKeep in mind that an air purifier never removes all smells. Some air purifiers have better filters and more power than others.\nBut no air purifier is perfect.\n\u0026ldquo;As a purifier for smoke and odor, this is actually a pretty good one though. When I cook and this turns on, my house smells less – although it doesn’t completely eliminate the smell. In fact, neither the Coway nor the Levoit was able to completely eliminate smells (but that was not my concern at all).\u0026rdquo;\nZenzinin on a Levoit Core 400 review\nBased on this, let’s postulate the following:\n“For ideal smell removal, an air purification needs to run in a clean and vented home” Daniel (me) from heatertips.com\nClean your home Air in a clean home is easier to purify than air in a cluttered and dusty home.\nClean your home regularly. Put order into things. Vacuum the floor.\nOccasionally wipe the floor.\nThe less clutter and dust there is in your living space, the smaller the surface area for bad odors to stick to.\nA cluttered and dirty room, (ironically) similar to a charcoal filter, has a large surface area that attracts smells.\nVent your home Also, vent your home. Especially if the odor originates from inside your home (from cooking, or whatever), venting is more effective than purifying.\nThe airstream from venting just carries the air outside.\nAlthough, I understand if your situation is exceptional. For example, I once lived in a small one-room apartment with one window. Venting was pointless since you can’t create an airstream with just one window.\nBut if venting is possible for you, do it!\nYou can even keep your air purifier running with a window open.\nThe air entering from the window not only carries bad odors outdoors, it also redistributes gases and particles and makes them easier to pick up for your air purifier.\nRecommended air purifier to remove odors My favorite odor-removing air purifiers are the Levoit Core series air purifiers. Personally, I use the Levoit Core 300 (see my review).\nBut I live in a moderately sized home. I usually run it in my 120 sq. ft. room. My apartment is roughly 800 sq. ft.\nIf your living space is a similar size, I can highly recommend the Core 300!\nFor larger spaces, I recommend getting the Levoit Core 400 (click here to view it on amazon) or the Core 600.\nYou can choose the size (Core 300, 400, or 600) on the purchase page!\nAll Levoit Core air purifiers come with a combined HEPA and activated charcoal filter.\nSo, they are able to remove odors from your room.\nFrequently asked questions about air purifier odor removal: Answered! Q: Can an air purifier completely eliminate pet odors?\nA: While an air purifier can significantly reduce pet odors by capturing pet dander and other airborne particles, it may not completely eliminate them. It\u0026rsquo;s also important to regularly clean and maintain pet areas to effectively control odors.\nQ: Are air purifiers effective against cigarette smoke?\nA: Yes, air purifiers with activated carbon filters can be effective at reducing the smell of cigarette smoke. However, for complete smoke odor removal, source control and regular home cleaning are also necessary.\nQ: How long does it take for an air purifier to remove odors?\nA: The length of time it takes an air purifier to remove odors can vary based on the size of the room, the capacity of the air purifier, and the intensity of the odor. In general, you may notice an improvement in air quality within a few hours, but it could take longer for stronger odors.\nConclusion Your air purifier needs an activated carbon filter to remove most odors.

Dust is, in the end, just the particles that are visible to the eye.\nAir purifiers filter much smaller particles than that!\nStill, after some time, you should see something on the filters. If that’s not the case, today is the day this is going to change.\nHere’s my promise:\nAfter reading this article, you’ll know exactly what’s wrong with your air purifier and how to fix it.\nThere may not even be anything wrong with your air purifier.\nAnyways, after this article, you’ll end up with clean and dust-free air. Promised!\nQuick answer: Your air purifier might not collect dust due to clogged filters, unsuitable room size, improper placement, or seals on new filters. Place your air purifier in the center of the room, with a proper filter and high fan speed settings.\nSummary table: Most likely causes for your air purifier not collecting dust Let’s first have a look at the most common causes of an air purifier not collecting dust and what you should do.\nWe will take a closer look at each of the listed causes (and many more).\n**Cause****Do I Need to Take Action?**Filter SaturationYes, check/clean/replace the filter.Low-Quality FiltersYes, purchase genuine, high-quality filters.Incorrect Room SizeYes, adjust purifier placement or get an appropriate size purifier.Low Fan SpeedYes, increase the fan speed.Filter Still Sealed from PackagingYes, open the purifier, remove the plastic or seal from the filter, and ensure it\u0026rsquo;s properly seated before use.Location of the PurifierYes, reposition the purifier to a central location.Wrong Type of FilterYes, check if the filter type is suitable for dust and replace if necessary.Humidity LevelsYes, consider adjusting indoor humidity with a humidifier or dehumidifier.Competing Air CurrentsYes, reposition other airflow-altering appliances or the purifier.Stale Air ZonesPotentially, improve room air circulation or move the purifier.Air LeakagesYes, ensure the purifier is sealed correctly and the filter is properly seated.\nLet’s have a look at all of these potential causes and their fixes in more detail!\nReasons and fixes for your air purifier not collecting dust Here’s a complete list of all the reasons and fixes for your air purifier not collecting dust. Some of the causes are more obvious than others.\n1. Sealed filter in a new air purifier This one is rather obvious. But it happened to me with my Levoit Core 300 air purifier.\nSo, I am sure I am not the only one.\nOn the day I got my air purifier, I turned it on and left it running for a couple of hours. Aside from a mysterious subtle crackling noise, the air purifier did its job just fine.\nOr so I thought.\nWhen I checked how to replace filters, I noticed that the filter was still sealed.\nLuckily I took a picture: The filter in my new air purifier was sealed! So, obviously, it could not collect any dust!\nSurely this is to ensure the cleanliness and integrity of a new filter. At least I don’t want to buy an air purifier, not knowing if the filter inside has already been used.\nIf you don’t remove the seal before using your air purifier, it won’t be able to pull air through the filter, effectively making the air purifier useless.\nAn air purifier with a sealed filter is a simple fan and won’t ever collect dust.\nHow to fix it Open your air purifier, take out the sealed filter, and remove the packaging or protective seal from it.\nReplace the filter in its slot and close the air purifier again.\nBy the way: I found a note in the air purifier’s user manual instructing me to remove the filter’s seal.\nSo, running an air purifier with a sealed filter should be avoidable if you read user manuals. But who does that?\n2. Clogged or saturated filter Filters get clogged over time which reduces their effectiveness. Clogged filters have problems pulling air through.\nSaturated filters can pull in air, but they can’t hold on to more particles.\nThe difference between clogging and saturation is subtle, but usually, clogging prevents airflow, while saturation prevents additional particle collection.\nIf your air purifier doesn’t collect dust, likely it is clogged.\nHow to fix it Clean or replace your air filters regularly. A HEPA filter’s life expectancy is around 160 days. After that, its particle reduction efficiency reduces to 50%.\nHowever, this “particle reduction efficiency” applies to all particles, including particles as small as a fraction of a micrometer.\nDust particles are much larger than that!\nSo, if you want your air purifier to just collect dust, you can shake out and brush your air filter!\nHowever, if you want it to collect smaller particles, such as bacteria, viruses or smoke (ranging from 0.01 microns to 60 microns), you will need a new replacement HEPA filter.\n3. Poor quality air filters Not all filters are equal. Actually, all filters should be able to trap dust. So, no matter how bad the quality of your filter is, after some time, dust should accumulate.\nHowever, some air filters have such bad quality, that they micro-tear quickly due to larger particles. Dust then flies through these micro tears.\nI did a quick search for replacement filters for my air purifier model and found a cheap replacement filter with this review:\n“The mesh is too large covering the filter so it doesn’t trap larger debris”\nreviewer CanadianJustice on amazon (product not linked because of apparent poor quality)\nAir filters always have a mesh that covers them. If that mesh is too large, large dirt and sand particles just fly through and tear open the micro-fabric that is supposed to collect dust.\nHow to fix it Usually, it’s best to get original replacement filters or at least replacement filters from a good filter company.\nUsually, you can tell from the Amazon ratings how good a filter is. Just watch out for artificial-sounding fake reviews!\n4. Incorrect Room Size A large part of an air purifier’s capability to collect dust comes from it creating a room-wide airflow. This airflow rises from the air purifier to the ceiling, then takes a path across the ceiling, down the walls, and into the corners of the room from where it carries dust toward the air purifier.\nIf your air purifier is too weak, it can’t create a room-wide circular airflow.\nAir purifier strength has to match room size.\nHow to fix it Either use your air purifier in a smaller room. Keep it running for a couple of days or even weeks. It should collect more dust there.\nGet an appropriate air purifier for your large rooms, such as the Levoit Core 600 (click here to view it on amazon) which is strong enough for even the largest living rooms.\n5. Low Fan Speed Aside from running a too-weak air purifier, you might have a strong enough model, but you run it on too-low settings.\nEssentially, there is no difference between a strong air purifier running at “Medium” airspeed, and a weak air purifier running at high airspeed.\nFor example, the regular-size Levoit Core 300 air purifier consumes 47W of power on the highest setting. That’s similar to the 49 Watts the larger Levoit Core 600 model consumes on the medium setting.\nHow to fix it Increase the fan speed of your moderately powerful air purifier. Try running your air purifier on the highest setting for a few days.\nYes, the noise can be annoying.\nBut through this experiment, you can verify whether you actually need a larger air purifier.\nIf your air purifier starts collecting dust on the highest setting, I recommend getting a larger air purifier, such as the Levoit Core 600 (which I linked earlier).\nLarger air purifiers are quieter than small air purifiers on comparable power settings. A large air purifier at “Medium” airspeed is quieter than a small air purifier at “High” airspeed.\n6. Improper Air Purifier Placement In general, you can place your air purifier wherever you like and it should still collect dust. However, some placements are better than others.\nFor example, you can run your air purifier next to an open window, but the window’s airflow can reduce the number of dust particles nearby.\nIf there’s no dust nearby, your air purifier has a harder time collecting it.\nHow to fix it So, move your air purifier away from air streams (doors, windows, etc.). Place it in the center of your room and run it at full power.\nThis is the only way your air purifier can create its own air stream to pick up dust.\n7. Wrong Type of Filter or Air Purifier Different air purifiers use various filter and air purifier types like HEPA or activated carbon, UV, and ionizing.\nSome are more effective against dust than others. Here’s a quick table:\n**Air purifier filter type****Does it collect dust?**HEPAYes, captures 99.97% of particles ≥0.3 microns.Activated CarbonYes, but traps not all dust due to porous structure (mostly intended to capture gases).UVNo. UV filters have no physical membrane. Dust flies straight through them. Neutralizes microorganisms, not dust.Ionizing PurifiersNo. Ionizing causes particles to fall, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t trap dust directly.\nAs you can see, UV and ionizing air purifiers usually do nothing for dust collection. There are many air purifiers, where different filters are combined.\nFor example UV + HEPA. These do collect dust. But pure UV or ionizing air purifiers don’t collect dust.\nHow to fix it Use a HEPA filter air purifier for effective dust collection.\n8. Too high or too low humidity High humidity makes dust particles heavier and more likely to settle, while extremely low humidity can cause static electricity repelling dust from filters.\nIn one study published in the Geophysical Research Letters, geophysicists measured the effects of humidity on dust:\n“Humidity in the air can form a thin film of water on the surface of soil particles, which could inhibit the electrostatic forces, but enhance the wet-bonding forces between the soil particles”\nMa, X., Gao, Q., Jiang, X., Chen, S., Gan, Y., Zhang, T., et al. (2023). Direct effects of air humidity on dust aerosol production: Evidences for the surprising role of electrostatic forces. Geophysical Research Letters, 50\nEven though these experiments checked the effect on soil dust, it is not far-fetched to expect that humidity has a similar impact on household dust.\nHow to fix it Use a dehumidifier in high-humidity conditions or a humidifier in very dry conditions to maintain balanced indoor humidity.\nRun your air purifier together with a humidifier in dry environments. Just make sure to place them farther apart than on the image, otherwise the air purifier will just suck in all the moisture.\nTo determine whether to use a humidifier or dehumidifier, check your room\u0026rsquo;s moisture levels: if the air feels damp and muggy, use a dehumidifier; if it\u0026rsquo;s dry and causes skin or respiratory discomfort, get a humidifier.\nIf the air in your room feels neutral, not particularly dry or humid, humidity is not the cause for your air purifier not collecting dust.\nOnly extreme humidity levels (wet or dry) can inhibit dust collection.\n9. Competing Airflows from Other Devices If you run any other devices aside from your air purifier that create an airflow, they might interfere with your air purifier’s dust collection.\nAppliances like fans, heaters, or air conditioners can redirect airflow away from the purifier.\nHow to fix it Reposition other appliances to ensure they aren\u0026rsquo;t redirecting airflow away from the purifier. If you can’t reposition them, simply place your air purifier elsewhere.\nOr, of course, you can use a stronger air purifier that dominates all other air currents.\n10. Stale Air Zones Stale air zones are zones in your room that lack proper airflow. It is not possible for your air purifier to create a dust-collecting air draft in these zones.\nThe more stuff you have lying around in your home and the more furniture you have, the harder it is to generate a room-wide airflow.\nHow to fix it You can fix the source of the issue by decluttering your room. Even removing one or two pieces of furniture helps.\nOf course, this is not always an option. Alternatively, get a strong floor fan such as this heavy-duty fan (click here to view it on amazon) and every once in a while turn it on full power to redistribute the dust in your room.\nThe strong air draft picks up dust from far-away corners and from behind furniture your air purifier wouldn’t be able to collect on its own.\n11. Air Leaks Air leaks inside your air purifier can cause air to bypass the filter.\nThese air leaks can come from impact damage (when your air purifier falls down from an elevated surface), or simply bad production quality.\nUsually, good air purifiers are airtight, in the sense that all air has to pass through the filter.\nHow to fix it Check for any gaps, especially around the filter.\nAlso, make sure that the filter itself doesn’t have any holes.\nEnsure the filter is correctly seated and the purifier\u0026rsquo;s housing is securely closed.\n12. Aged Air Purifier Air purifiers can last you a long time. But aging does not necessarily depend on usage.\nSome air purifiers age, even though you use them very little. Some other air purifiers don’t age, even though you run them on end.\nAging, in this sense, depends on the production quality of your air purifier and how well you care for it.\nIf your air purifier lacks care, it ages and degrades in performance and its ability to collect dust.\nHow to fix it Replace your air purifier filter every 6 months! This is crucial to keep up the particle collection efficiency and to unload the fan.\nIf you can, also lubricate the fan’s bearings occasionally.\n( This might be a bit harder to do and requires you to disassemble your air purifier since some fans are embedded deep inside the purifier’s case )\nThe newer the filter, the less power the fan needs to blow air through it. This, in turn, keeps air speed up. And high air speed usually means high dust collection rate.\nIf you already wore down your air purifier and it does not collect dust, even though you changed filters and lubricated the fan, I recommend getting a new one.\nAnd care for your new air purifier regularly!\n13. Air Purifier Design Honestly, some air purifiers are just trash by design. Air purifiers do best when they can suck in air from all directions (into their bottom openings) and blow clean air out into the room (from the top).\nUsually, these are cylindrical air purifiers. This creates a dust-collecting airflow along the floor.\nOther air purifiers stand on attached feet or have a tower-like design, with an elevated air intake.\nThese obviously can’t collect dust as well as close-to-ground cylindrical air purifiers.\nHow to fix it Get a good air purifier with a design that allows airflow across the floor.\nI recommend the Levoit Core series.\n14. Air purifier not even turning on If your air purifier does not collect dust, are you even sure it’s running at all? Does it turn on?\nAnd if it turns on, does it blow any air?\nAn air purifier that doesn’t run obviously won’t collect any dust.\nHow to fix it If your air purifier doesn’t turn on or it turns on but doesn’t blow air, I recommend checking my air purifier repair guide:\nHow to fix an air purifier not turning on\nChecklist to Ensure Your Air Purifier Effectively Collects Dust Based on all the possible causes we just investigated, here’s a quick checklist to get your air purifier to collect dust:\nInitial Setup: Unseal the filter: Before the first use, ensure the filter isn\u0026rsquo;t sealed in its packaging. Correct placement: Place the purifier away from open windows or doors and in the center of the room for optimal airflow. Regular Maintenance: Filter replacement: Change the filter every 6 months or as recommended by the manufacturer. Cleaning: Clean external parts and any pre-filters to ensure optimal airflow. Check for air leaks: Ensure that there are no gaps or holes causing air to bypass the filter. Performance Optimization: Reassess room size: Ensure the purifier\u0026rsquo;s capacity matches the room\u0026rsquo;s volume. Adjust fan speed: If dust collection is inadequate, consider increasing the speed. Check humidity: Extreme humidity levels can affect dust collection. Use a humidifier or dehumidifier as needed. Device Quality \u0026amp; Design: Design Considerations: Choose a design that pulls air from multiple directions (ideally across the floor) for optimal dust collection. Troubleshooting: Ensure it\u0026rsquo;s running: If there\u0026rsquo;s no dust collection, verify the device is turning on and blowing air. Advanced tips and tricks to collect more dust with air purifiers Here are two more ways to improve your air purifier’s dust collection rate. And I believe the second tip is unexpected!\nUse multiple purifiers to collect dust If, after reading all of this post, you found out that your air purifier is too weak for your room, you should get a new air purifier.\nBut instead of getting a large air purifier, you can just as well get a second medium-sized air purifier and run both purifiers simultaneously.\nGenerally, two air purifiers running simultaneously will collect as much dust as one large air purifier.\nThe only downside is that you have to replace more air filters the more air purifiers you run.\nClean your home When you clean your home, obviously, you collect a lot of dust. But, ironically, the cleaner your home, the more dust your air purifier can collect.\nIn a clean room with clean floors, dust particles have nothing to stick to. So, it is very easy for your air purifier to draw dust particles in.\nOn the other hand, in a dirty room, with a lot of dust on the floor, small dust particles will clump together with the dust and debris that’s already on your floor. These clumps of dirt are heavier and, therefore, harder to collect for your air purifierö.\nSo, clean your home regularly!\nAir purifiers are good at keeping rooms clean, not at cleaning them!\nDoes no dust in my air purifier filter mean it’s not working? No! Dust is just one type of particle that air purifiers filter.\nIf there’s no dust on your filter, likely, it still captures other particles. Usually, you can’t tell by looking at the filter, whether it collects any particles.\nEspecially, if the filter is new (a couple of weeks or a few months), it’s hard to tell.\nBut as soon as you compare your filter with a new replacement filter, you should be able to see the difference.\nThe filter in use might have a slight discoloring. And maybe you see some small particles, hair, etc. if you have a closer look.\nConclusion If your air purifier is not collecting dust, the best thing you can do is to run it on the highest setting for a few days.\nPossibly, it’s just a lack of power.\nIn this case, just get a new, more powerful air purifier.\nHowever, if you are sure your air purifier is the right size for your room, try blowing up the dust with a floor fan.\nAnd, interestingly, cleaning your room could also help.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-an-air-purifier-not-collecting-dust/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour air purifier is not collecting dust, even though you already run it for a \u003ca href=\"/can-you-run-air-purifier-all-day/\"\u003elong time\u003c/a\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we’re going to check all the possible causes of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd before we take the deep dive: Not all air purifiers have to collect dust.

However, loud buzzing, screeching, or even banging noises can even indicate that something dangerous is going on inside your air purifier and it needs repair.\nMy name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer, and I’ve worked in an electronics repair department of a large electronics factory. So, I’ve encountered quite a bunch of strange noises.\nThe most ridiculous one is the capacitor squeal, which makes electronic devices sound like a crying baby. This sound can occur in air purifiers.\nSo, without further ado, let’s have a look at the different noise types.\nSummary: Is my air purifier’s noise dangerous? Here’s a quick summary of all the noises listed in this article and whether the noise is dangerous and needs to be fixed.\nOf course, you can do something about any noise listed here. So, just because I tell you the noise is not dangerous, doesn’t mean you should do nothing about it.\n**Noise type****Is it dangerous?**Loud fan noisenoHumming noisenoCrackling noisenoWhistling noisenoScratchingyesBuzzingyesBangingyesScreechingyesWhining / squealing noiseno\nNow, I’d suggest you find out which of these noises best fits your air purifier’s noise. Once you got it, let’s continue with the investigation!\nI will start every noise section with a short explanation of the noise, including potential causes. After that, we’ll check how to test for the different causes and fix them.\n1. Loud fan noise The most common noise in an air purifier, is, of course, the noise coming from the fan. The fan is the only moving part in your air purifier.\nAnd anything that moves, makes noise. Consequently, most of the noises in an air purifier have something to do with the built-in fan.\nA loud fan noise is not necessarily something unexpected.\nAir purifiers force air through the filter, which excites the filter membranes. We perceive this vibration as noise.\nRemember this: Any air movement creates noise. There is no air movement without noise.\nPotential cause: Too high airspeed setting The noise of an air purifier increases exponentially with the airspeed setting. Measurements show that air purifier power consumption doubles with each fan speed level.\nAccordingly, noise doubles with each increase of airspeed.\nHow to fix it Your air purifier has a display or indicator lights that represent the current airspeed level. Reduce this setting.\nPotential cause: Clogged filter An air purifier filter’s efficiency reduces by 50% after about 160 days of running. This means you should replace your filter twice a year.\nIf your filter is clogged, it could increase noise levels depending on how your air purifier controls fan speed.\nIf your air purifier has an adaptive fan speed control, it tries to rotate the built-in fan at a certain speed.\nIf, however, dust clogs the air filter, the built-in fan can not reach that speed, so the power control increases fan power.\nAs a result, your air purifier increases the force with which it presses air through the clogged air filter.\nLikely, your air purifier is louder than it needs to be.\nHow to fix it Fixing it is very simple. Depending on the air purifier model you have, get a good replacement filter.\nThen, open the bottom or backside of your air purifier, take out the old filter, and put in the new filter.\nPotential cause: Air purifier placement The geometry of walls or furniture around your air purifier can amplify the sound coming from it.\nIf placed in the worst spot possible, e.g. in a cone-shaped corner of your room, all noise coming from the air purifier is forced in one direction (into the room).\nAnd in the worst case of the worst case, the air and walls around your air purifier are arranged perfectly to match the air purifier’s acoustic impedance (a kind of air resistance), making it even louder.\nIt’s similar to having the ideal-sized hammer for a specific nail.\nThat’s the same effect that makes many instruments, such as horns and tubas, work.\nHow to fix it Place your air purifier in the center of your room. Air purifiers work best if they stand freely in the center of a room since this creates ideal airflow.\nAlso, sound waves bouncing off the walls cancel each other out.\nYour air purifier should be quieter standing in the center of your room.\nI did a quick experiment on this:\n**Air purifier placement****Noise level (highest fan speed setting)**Center of room57dBCorner of the room (behind the bed)60dB\n2. Humming noise Humming noise in an air purifier is relatively normal. I can’t really think of anything dangerous causing it.\nBut you can reduce it! Let’s have a look.\nPotential cause: Airspeed setting matches your room’s resonance frequency Humming noise is often caused by the vibration of your air purifier fan matching one of your room’s resonance frequencies.\nFor example, a typical air purifier fan rotates at the following frequencies:\nFan speed setting****FrequencySlow10.29 Hz (617 RPM)Medium16.61 Hz (996 RPM)High33.01 Hz (1981 RPM)\nThe lowest frequency humans can hear is 20 Hz.\n“Humans can detect sounds in a frequency range from about 20 Hz to 20 kHz”\nNeuroscience. 2nd edition\nSo, according to the table, an air purifier can only create an audible humming noise if it’s at a high fan speed setting.\nIf, by accident, this frequency matches a resonance frequency of your room, the humming noise is amplified.\nHow to fix it To reduce the noise coming from your air purifier, place it on anti-vibration pads (click here to view them on amazon).\nAnti-vibration pads absorb the vibration from your air purifier and prevent it from resonating with your room.\nYou should hear a considerable difference.\nThese anti-vibration pads are good for larger air purifiers. For small air purifiers, an anti-vibration mat might be better (since it’s easier to balance on).\n3. Crackling noise Crackling noise is an interesting one. And it’s got a funny backstory (for me at least).\nWhen I got my first air purifier, I turned it on and it started crackling.\nI thought the crackling was normal. After a couple of minutes of running the (crackling) air purifier, I wanted to explore the air purifier’s settings and find out how to replace the filter.\nWhen I opened the bottom part of my air purifier, the new filter was still sealed in plastic foil!\nThat’s what caused the crackling!\nPotential cause: Sealed filter in your new air purifier New air purifiers contain sealed filters. And, when I think about it, it makes sense.\nAfter all, air purifier companies don’t want someone to buy an air purifier, and then return it with a used filter (filters cost money).\nWith the sealed filter packaging, an air purifier company ensures that the filter you get is new and not used.\nOf course, before you run your air purifier for the first time, you have to know that you have to unbox the filter as well.\nIronically, the plastic packaging renders the air purifier totally useless, since the filter can’t filter anything then.\nAnd I bet there are people somewhere on the planet running air purifiers with sealed filters, not knowing they have to remove them…\nHow to fix it Before you run your new air purifier, remove the air filter’s plastic packaging. There should be no crackling noise afterward.\nPotential cause: Dirt or sand trapped around the air filter Another thing that can make your air purifier crackle is dirt or sand in the filter component.\nDepending on how your air purifier is built, the air stream inside it could cause large particles such as sand or dirt to go in circles creating a crackling sound.\nThere are many ways this can happen, such as crumbs from your evening snack falling into the top opening of your air purifier when it’s turned off.\nOr clipped pieces of fingernails flying into the air purifier.\nHow to fix it\nOpen your air purifier take out the filter and vacuum the inside of your air purifier to remove all these large particles.\n4. Whistling If you hear a whistling sound coming from your air purifier, something is definitely going wrong.\nWhistles naturally occur when air blows over a sharp edge, which causes the edge to vibrate at its resonance frequency ( source).\nAir purifiers never whistle on their own. Of course. There are no sharp edges your air purifier blows air over.\nHere are some reasons:\nPotential reason: Hole in the air filter There might be a hole in your air filter. The air filter naturally is a resistance for the air to pass through.\nIf there is a hole, all the air tries to pass through this narrow space, at extremely high speed (according to Bernoulli’s principle).\nThis can create a whistling sound.\nHow to fix it The best way to fix a hole in your air filter is to replace it with a suitable replacement filter for your air purifier model.\nAlternatively, you can probably also stitch the hole with a piece of cloth. But that’s a lot of work for little gain. And imperfect stitches will reduce the filter’s overall efficiency.\nSo, I recommend just getting a new one.\nPotential cause: Something sharp trapped inside Whistling (just like crackling) can come from something trapped inside your air purifier. Whistling is a typical sound you can create with paper, by blowing right at the edge of a sheet of paper.\nSo, there might be a piece of paper, plastic, or something else that’s sharp trapped inside your air purifier.\nHow to fix it Open your air purifier, take out the filter, and check whether you see anything inside your air purifier.\nIf you don’t see anything, you can also turn on your air purifier without the filter and check if the whistling persists.\nIf it does, continue opening the purifier until you find the cause of the whistling. And if there is no whistling when you run your air purifier without the filter, there might be something wrong with the filter instead.\nPotential cause: Capacitor whistle Here’s one more thing that can cause your air purifier to whistle. This cause is not related to airspeed.\nCapacitors on the built-in electronic circuit board can whistle.\nA capacitor is basically a rolled-up piece of metal, with insulation between the layers. When you apply alternating voltages to your capacitor, it expands and contracts slightly.\nIf you use a capacitor within its voltage specification, you won’t hear a thing.\nBut if there’s a fault in the electronics, one of the capacitors inside your air purifier might receive too high voltages and whistle.\nHow to fix it To fix a whistling capacitor, you have to disassemble your air purifier until you get to the electronic circuit board.\nListen to where the whistling comes from and you should be able to spot a broken part on the circuitry.\nAfter working in an electronics repair department, my number 1 tip for troubleshooting electronics is just to stare at them for 5 minutes.\nThis might sound weird, but 90% of the issues are visible. There could be\na broken-off part a blown part burn marks Look out for those.\nIf you find something, get the right replacement part online or in an electronics shop. Likely, you have to replace the broken part by soldering.\nIf you can’t see anything off, yet you still hear whistling from the circuitry, locate the whistling part and measure voltages around it.\nCompare the measured voltage with the voltage rating of the whistling part and trace the overly high voltage to its origin.\nIf you’re not able to do these fixes, skip to the last section of this article “What to do if you can’t fix it”. You can fix these issues with a simple trick.\n5. Scratching Scratching sounds always come from a moving part scraping along another part’s surface.\nPotential cause: Broken fan blade Depending on the type of fan inside your air purifier, the fan blades might be more or less fragile.\nIt could be that your fan blade broke. This usually doesn’t happen on its own.\nEither you run your air purifier for very long times (years on end), or you did not insert the filter properly and the fan scratches along the filter’s surface.\nHow to fix it Open your air purifier and check the fan blades and your air filter.\nIf either of them is broken, replace it. Replacement fans might be hard to get, but you can harvest parts from broken air purifiers.\nPotential cause: Wasp nest inside your air purifier Wasps build their nests anywhere. And air purifiers (if they are turned off) offer perfect shelters for wasps.\nSo, if you don’t run your air purifier for some time, there could be wasps inside it. Especially if you store your air purifier in an outdoor shed.\nHow to fix it Open your air purifier and check its inside. Remove anything that blocks the fan.\nIf you really find a wasp nest, replace your air purifier’s filter. Likely, it has many holes or dirt on it.\nPotential cause: Fan bearings broken Broken bearings create scratching noises! Normally, bearings don’t break on their own.\nAverage fan bearings have an expected lifespan of 50,000 hours.\nSo, either your air purifier is very old and the bearings indeed broke due to heavy usage. Or your air purifier took fall damage.\nHow to fix it To fix broken bearings, you have to take the fan out of your air purifier and disassemble it until you can access the fan’s bearings. Also, check the fan’s rotational axis for faults while you’re at it.\nFan bearings are usually cheap to get. Even better would be to replace the entire air purifier fan with a matching one.\nHowever, depending on the air purifier brand, these fans may be custom and hard to get by.\nYou can harvest a fan from a broken matching air purifier model instead (you can find broken air purifiers online, on Craigslist, eBay, or some other marketplace).\n6. Buzzing noise Buzzing noise always indicates that something is wrong with the air purifier’s power electronics.\nThat’s the electronic component receiving power from your wall outlet.\nPotential cause: Too high voltage on wall outlet causes transformer buzzing There might be a fault in the wall outlet you use, such as a grounding issue. These can cause a voltage overload.\nYour air purifier’s built-in power electronics (including the transformer) can start buzzing.\nActually, transformers always buzz. However, if used within its voltage specifications, a transformer’s buzzing is very quiet. So you can’t hear it.\nHow to fix it First of all, try running your air purifier off a different wall outlet. Ideally, it should be a wall outlet in a different room, on a different floor, or even in the garage.\nThe farther away it is, the better. This way you ensure that you use a different electric circuit from your house.\nIf it works there, that means something is off with the first wall outlet. Or even with the entire room’s circuit (you can try other wall outlets in your room as well).\nIn this case, I recommend hiring a technician to check the issue. Since this is about power electronics (and not a simple on-board circuitry fix in the air purifier), you should go the safe route.\nPotential cause: Electric fault in the electric power component Of course, the buzzing coming from your air purifier can also come from an internal electronic fault.\nTransformers, capacitors, and inductors can all create buzzing sounds when there’s an issue with the electronics.\nHow to fix it Open up your air purifier until you can see the electronic circuitry. Inspect the circuit board for visible issues.\nIf you can’t see any issues, use a multimeter to trace voltages. Listen to where the buzzing comes from.\nGet the right replacement part and use a soldering iron to replace it.\n7. Banging noise Banging noises are incredibly rare in air purifiers. It has to be something related to the fan.\nPotential cause: Broken fan axis If the fan axis is broken, but the motor still tries to rotate it, there can be a banging sound, coming from the broken axis “jumping” around.\nHow to fix it Depending on how the rotational axis’ material, you may be able to glue it. You can cold weld it using this J-B weld epoxy with hardener (click here to view it on amazon).\nAlthough, admittedly, I doubt that the term “ cold welding” is applicable here. Or at least it’s not scientifically precise. Still, this glue should be able to fix your fan!\nAlternatively, either get a matching replacement fan (from a matching used air purifier). Or discard the air purifier entirely and get a new one.\n8. Screeching / Whining noise Screeching and whining noises usually have similar causes as whistling noises. Screeching is just like whistling but with a higher-pitched, harsh mix of frequencies.\nAnd whining is like whistling, but with amplitude and frequencies changing over time.\nPotential cause: Fault in a capacitor or inductance Screeching and whining noises can occur in capacitors and inductances. Transformers are usually too heavy for screeching or whistling to occur.\nHow to fix it Again, since this is an issue in the electronics, the solution is to disassemble your air purifier and inspect the circuitry.\nOnce disassembled, you can plug your air purifier into the wall outlet (be careful not to touch anything!) and listen to where the sound is coming from.\nOnce you locate the faulty part, find a matching replacement part online and replace it using a soldering iron.\nIf that doesn’t help and the new part starts screeching or whistling as well, the issue comes from a different part or a short circuit nearby.\nIn this case, you should trace voltages and look out for unusual values. Typical examples are zero voltage across a capacitor or a resistor without resistance (which means there’s a short circuit somewhere).\nWhat to do if you can’t fix your noisy air purifier Admittedly, you need electronics skills to do many of these fixes. And unfortunately, there’s no easy way out.\nOr is there?\nHere are a few suggestions if you can’t fix electronics:\nHarvest replacement parts from used / defective air purifiers If you roughly know where the noise is coming from, or which part is broken, you might as well buy a defective air purifier matching your model to harvest replacement parts. **\n** Instead of fixing the circuitry yourself, your might as well simply replace it.\nThis method is very effective since used or defective air purifiers are easy to get online. And replacement parts are hard to get. So, just get broken air purifiers and use them as your replacement part source.\nAnd if replacing entire components in your air purifier is not your thing either…\nSell your broken air purifier and get a new one You switch sides and, instead of trying to fix your broken air purifier, simply sell it. Someone else will buy it from you and try to fix it or use it for replacement parts.\nAnd you get a bit of cash for your air purifier.\nThen, use that money to buy a new air purifier.\nFor your new air purifier, I highly recommend the Levoit Core 300 (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt is a very solid product. The built-in fan is indestructible. And it will last you for decades if you care for it!\nClick here to read my full review: My favorite air purifier (review)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/air-purifier-making-noise-fixes/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour air purifier is making some noise and you wonder whether that noise is normal or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, you’re in the right place!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we’re going to check the different noises air purifiers can produce and what you can do about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome noises, for example, quiet humming are normal.

There’s not much that can break if it does not turn on.\nSo, they are relatively simple to repair.\nIn this article, my goal is to list every possible reason why your air purifier might not turn along with how to fix it!\nAfter reading this article, you’ll know exactly how to fix your air purifier. And even if you can’t fix it, stick out until the end of this article. I still have a couple of ideas to get you a working air purifier quickly.\nPlease note that all the sample images in this post are from my own air purifier (the Levoit Core 300). But air purifiers all work exactly the same!\nIt doesn’t matter if you have a Levoit, Dyson, Germ Guardian, Philipps, Nuwave, or Blueair (or any other brand).\nThe tips in this fixing guide apply to all air purifier brands.\nFirst of all, there are two different ways air purifiers don’t turn on. We will cover both of them in this article. Feel free to skip to the section you need:\nYour air purifier does not turn on after pressing the Power button Your air purifier turns on, but the fan does not blow air Reasons and fixes for an air purifier not turning on after pressing the power button This section covers all the possible reasons and fixes for your air purifier not turning on after you press the power button.\nSome of the reasons and fixes are obvious to most people. But I will include them here anyways (you wouldn’t believe how simple some people’s problems are to solve).\nFor each cause, I will additionally include at least one way to test for the cause. The test helps you to check whether this cause applies to your case.\n#1 Blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker Normally, air purifiers don’t blow fuses or trip circuit breakers because of their low power consumption. But if you have a blown fuse, regardless of which device caused it, it’s going to prevent your air purifier from turning on.\nHow to test it Locate your home’s electric service panels. You will see a couple of circuit breakers, and, if your home is older, fuses.\nCheck that all circuit breakers are switched ON. If there are fuses, have a close look and check that all the wires inside the fuses are intact.\nIf that’s the case, not only will the air purifier not turn on, but other devices in the same room as well.\nAnother way to check is to try your air purifier in a different room (or even a different house). If the two rooms are on different electric circuits, your air purifier will work.\nHow to fix it You can fix a tripped circuit breaker by simply flipping the switch. If one of the fuses blew you should be able to get a replacement fuse with a similar rating at any hardware store or online.\nYou can read the rating off one end of the fuse. Mostly it’s 15 or 20 Amps.\nOnce you have the right replacement fuse, replace the fuse in the electric service box.\nYour air purifier should work now.\n#2 Defective wall outlet Possibly, the wall outlet you’re powering your air purifier from is defective. This usually happens after you plug a high-power device into your wall outlet and the high current welds parts inside the wall outlet together.\nBut, of course, it can also be as simple as something inside the wall outlet breaking through force.\nIn any case, let’s test it.\nHow to test it Testing for a defective wall outlet is simple. Just plug your air purifier in a different wall outlet and see if it works there.\nIf your air purifier works on a different outlet, there is definitely a fault in the wall outlet you used before.\nAlso, burn marks on your wall outlet are telling.\nAlternatively, you can use a multimeter to check the outlet’s voltage.\nHow to fix it To fix a faulty wall outlet, first, get a replacement outlet. Switch the room’s circuit breaker (in your home’s electric service box) to turn your room’s electric power off.\nThen, follow this video to replace the outlet:\n\u0026amp;ab_channel=TheRenderQ\nIf you are not comfortable replacing the outlet, you can hire a technician to do it for you. But honestly, it’s not too hard. And I’d say anyone who wants to do it can do it themselves.\nNothing can happen as long as you turn the power off before starting the replacement.\n#3 Faulty power cord It might as well be that the power cord that connects your air purifier and the wall outlet is broken.\nHonestly, this does not happen a lot. Power cords don’t just break. Especially, if you don’t move them around a lot.\nAir purifiers are stationary devices. And unless you carry it around the house multiple times a day, I don’t see a reason your power cord should be broken.\nBut, of course, it could be broken.\nAnd since this is a complete guide, let’s do a quick check:\nHow to test it First of all, let’s make sure that your wall outlet works. To do that, plug any device into the outlet and see if it works. You can use your phone charger, a hairdryer, or any other device nearby.\nIf your wall outlet is fine, plug your air purifier into the wall outlet again. Move it around. Also, move the power cord.\nIf the power cord has a loose contact, your air purifier’s power indicator light could turn on for a moment.\nTo really ensure the power cord is broken, you have to disassemble your air purifier, plug it into the wall outlet and measure whether any power arrives at the built-in circuitry.\nHow to fix it Fixing a broken power cord is a bit annoying since power cord replacements require soldering. Or at the very least, it requires disassembling your air purifier. Unless, of course, your air purifier’s power cord is detachable.\nI tried disassembling my Levoit Core 300 and found out that simply removing the screws is not enough. For a Levoit air purifier, you additionally have to use a kitchen knife to disassemble the air purifier.\nSee this video for instructions.\n\u0026amp;ab_channel=ChristopherThomas\nOf course, this is different for every model. So, if you have a different air purifier, try to unscrew all the screws you see. And if that doesn’t suffice, look up disassembly instructions for your specific model online.\nOnce your air purifier is disassembled, you should have access to the brown and blue power wires the power cord connects to.\nSimply remove the connection, either by cut or by unplugging the wires (of course, depending on what type of connection your purifier’s power cord uses).\nThen, use any replacement power cord, and cut off its female end to expose the inner wires. Solder color-matching from the replacement cord and your air purifier together.\nYou can connect your replacement power cord to the exposed blue and brown wires! (as in the image)\n#4 Power button fault Another potential cause of your air purifier not turning on at all could be a broken power button or touch panel (depending on the model you have).\nHow to test it To verify your power button is broken, disassemble your air purifier until you see the electronic circuit board the power button connects to.\nCheck with a multimeter whether voltages change if you press the button. Also, do a path continuity test on the power button’s connectors when the button is switched ON and OFF.\nHow to fix it Find out what exactly breaks your power button. It could be a torn-off wire or a short circuit, or something else.\nYou can fix most of these issues with a soldering iron.\nIf you don’t know what’s wrong with your power button, get a replacement. Since there are dozens of power button types, you have to dig for a matching replacement part online.\n#5 Fault in the electric circuitry Electric circuitry faults are the most interesting types of faults.\nAlmost any issue in the electronic circuitry will prevent your air purifier from turning on.\nI’ve worked in an electronics repair department of a large factory, so here’s my very special advice:\nHow to test it The simplest way to check for electric faults is by staring at the electric circuitry for 5 minutes.\nI promise you this works better than any measurement device.\nLook out for:\nparts broken off burn marks connectors “hovering” over their connection points (solder joints not connected) blown capacitors These are at least 90% of electronic failures I’ve encountered at my job. And for none of them, you need a measurement device.\nHow to fix it If you locate a broken-off part, you can try to solder it in place again. Your air purifier might turn on again.\nHowever, if you see burn marks or blown parts you will have to replace something.\nUsually, resistors that receive too high voltages burn out. And capacitors that receive too high voltages blow out.\nLocate the burnt or blown part and, based on the text on the label, or based on the color coding, buy a matching replacement part.\nTry to run your air purifier. If it works, great!\nIf it doesn’t work, likely you just solved the symptom, but not the cause. There might be a different broken part somewhere on the circuit board that causes the voltage overload.\nHave another look. If you don’t see anything, use a measurement device to check.\n#6 Obvious: Remote control battery This one is obvious, but I just want to make sure.\nIf you’re using your air purifier with a remote control, maybe the battery inside the remote is empty.\nHow to test it If your remote control uses infrared, there’s a neat trick you can do:\nPoint your phone camera at the remote’s small infrared LED and press the ON button. With bare eyes, you can’t see anything.\nBut your phone’s camera picks up the infrared radiation and displays it. If you can see the light, your battery is full, else it’s empty.\nHere’s what that looks like:\nTop view of my remote control: The violet light in this image is only visible through my smartphone\u0026rsquo;s camera!\nAlternative test: Some remote controls don’t use infrared. I’d say the simplest test is to just put a new battery in your remote and try.\nHow to fix it Replace the battery in your remote control and try turning your air purifier on again.\nIf the battery was empty before, it should work now.\nReasons and fixes for an air purifier fan not turning on So far we’ve looked at all the potential causes of your air purifier not turning on at all.\nThis section covers all the potential causes for your air purifier fan not working.\n#7 Fan motor power supply not working The electric circuitry in your air purifier drives the fan. There is one component that essentially converts the fan speed setting to an actual voltage to deliver to your air purifier’s built-in fan.\nAny issue in this motor driver component will cause your air purifier’s fan to not turn on.\nHow to test it\nDisassemble your air purifier until you see wires connecting to your fan. Check these wires. Are they intact? Is there a loose contact or short circuit?\nIf not, trace these fan power wires to their origin point on the circuit board. Check the circuit components in the vicinity of the power wires.\nDoes anything look off?\nYou can also try to power the fan yourself with a battery and two wires. If the fan rotates, the fan is working and the issue is definitely in the electronic circuitry.\nHow to fix it\nAny issue in the wires themselves is easy to fix. You can just resolder the wires if they are loose or broken off.\nIf you found an electronic fault, find a matching replacement part and replace it.\n#8 Fan is blocked A very simple reason for your fan not blowing air could be a blockage. It is very unlikely for your fan to block because of dust since any air entering your air purifier first passes through the filter before it reaches the fan.\nWith HEPA filters and their 99.97% particle collection efficiency, dust should never be the reason for a fan to be blocked.\nInstead, a part of the fan could be broken due to the air purifier tipping over.\nHow to test it Disassemble your air purifier until you see the fan. Try to rotate it by hand.\nA very light touch should already turn the fan with almost no resistance.\nIf your fan does not turn by hand easily or not at all, it is very likely broken.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an image of the fan inside my Levoit air purifier. It is rock solid and mounted with a metal nut. It is very unlikely that something breaks here.\nHow to fix it Remove the fan (usually you have to remove a larger nut from the fan’s axis) and check whether the rotational axis turns on its own.\nIf the entire fan doesn’t rotate, but the rotational axis with the fan unmounted does turn, then there is a blockage in the fan blades somewhere.\nIf the rotational axis doesn’t rotate, there might be a bigger issue, such as broken fan bearings.\nAlso, check for loose or broken parts.\nOnce you know which part is broken, you can either:\nRemove the part: You can remove unimportant parts and run your air purifier without them. For example, if a part of one fan blade broke off, you can safely discard it. Replace or fix the part: For important parts, the fan would not work without, such as the rotational axis, you either have to fix or replace it. Air purifier replacement parts are incredibly hard to get. I checked Amazon, manufacturer websites, and Chinese wholesale shops (like AliExpress). None of them had a replacement fan.\nYou still have two options:\nIf the broken part is fixable and made of plastic I recommend gluing it together with this J-B Weld epoxy glue (click here to view it on amazon).\nIf it is not fixable, you can also buy a matching defective air purifier online to harvest replacement parts.\n#9 Air purifier in locked mode Some air purifiers have a setting to lock their touch panel controls. If your touch panel is locked, you obviously can’t use it to turn the fan on.\nHow to test it Some air purifiers have a “lock” icon on their touch panel. Usually, the lock icon lights up when it is active.\nOn the right-hand side of the control panel, you can see the lock sign!\n( My air purifier is a Levoit model, so I assume most Levoit air purifiers have it )\nIf you see the lock icon, try touching different buttons on your touch panel.\nDo the buttons work? If yes, your air purifier is not locked.\nIf the buttons don’t work, even though your air purifier is turned on, your touch panel is locked.\nHow to fix it Touch the lock sign for 10 seconds.\nThe lock sign does not glow anymore.\nYou should be able to turn on your air purifier fan now.\nWhat if you can’t fix your air purifier I tried listing all of the possible fixes for your air purifier not turning on. In case the fixes did not help, or in case you don’t have the tools to fix yours, here’s what I would do:\nSell your broken air purifier online: There are plenty of people interested in buying, fixing, and flipping electronics. Someone will happily pick up your air purifier.\nThis way you get some of your money back.\nBuy a new air purifier: Air purifiers are very simple devices. There are very few things that can break as long as you handle them properly.\nI recommend buying a good quality air purifier.\nIn this article, I showed you my Levoit Core 300 (click here to read my review).\nI disassembled it to take pictures for this blog post for you to follow along (not because there was a real fault in it).\nAnd there is one thing I noticed: This air purifier is rock-solid.\nAlthough it’s made of plastic, the way it is assembled is almost bulletproof. Once I was able to remove the cover and reach the fan, I noted that the fan turns incredibly smoothly, but it does not shake around.\nAnd that’s what I love about this air purifier. I know that it will possibly last me for the next two decades without any problems.\nSo, if you hate repairing things, or you don’t have the means to, just buy a new air purifier.\nAir purifiers are not expensive. And worrying about them is not worth it.\nConclusion The most common causes of an air purifier not turning on are the power source not working (wall outlet or power cord), or issues in the electronic circuitry.\nMechanical failures like parts broken off or clogged fans are almost impossible since air purifier fans last a very long time and there is no chance of dust accumulation because of the built-in HEPA filter.\nI hope you were able to fix your air purifier not turning on with this complete guide!\nHowever, if you still can’t figure out the issue, just get a new air purifier and stop worrying.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-an-air-purifier-not-turning-on/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHere’s my complete guide on how to troubleshoot and fix an air purifier not turning on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAir purifiers are very simple devices.

Here are the first results that pop up (in a nutshell).\nGoogle search results for the query “Can you run an air purifier and a humidifier at the same time?”:\nYes (no explanation given at all)( source) Of course, now buy our filters ( source) Yes… we are an industry leader in superior filter systems - contact us and buy from us! ( source) I can’t help but read these answers with a clown voice.\nFor whatever reason, this simple question is absolutely dominated by trash content put out by the air filter industry.\nAnd, if you know my blog, I am sick of companies putting out content without substance trying to sell me their stuff.\nMessage to the air filter industry: It doesn’t work like this! Nobody buys your “superior” filters.\nSo, here’s me, Daniel, an electrical engineer. I am not affiliated with any company. On this website, my mission is to provide you with answers with substance and real-world advice.\nI don’t want to sell you anything.\nToday, we’re going to check whether running an air purifier and a humidifier at the same time makes sense.\nAnd if yes, how to do it. (Yes, there is an ideal way to do it).\nSo, let’s jump into the depths of air purifiers and humidifiers and find out!\nQuick answer: Yes, you can run an air purifier and a humidifier at the same time. However, place them far apart. Otherwise, the air purifier will pull in water droplets from the humidifier and accumulate moisture over time.\nDoes an air purifier filter absorb humidity? The problem of running an air purifier and a humidifier simultaneously essentially boils down to a key question: Does an air purifier filter absorb humidity?\nThat’s the core question we’re having a look at.\nBecause, if air purifiers don’t absorb humidity, they don’t interact with humidifiers. Meaning neither device affects the other.\nIf, however, air purifiers absorb humidity, that would be a problem. You don’t want to add water to the dust, dirt, and bacteria on your purifier filter. This would turn the filter into a breeding ground for more bacteria.\nSo, let’s check:\nSize of water molecules: Can a filter catch them? In most places where the humidity levels are very low, it makes sense to run a humidifier. When the humidity levels are low, water evaporates easily.\nThen, your air purifier encounters this evaporated water in its gaseous form: steam.\nSteam is invisible and consists of water molecules bouncing around heavily. Steam does not contain droplets of water, so it’s invisible.\nIf there were droplets, we would call it vapor!\nSo, can an air purifier filter steam?\nTo answer that, we have to look at the size of a water molecule and at the HEPA standard. HEPA is the air filter standard most quality air purifiers follow.\nA water molecule is tiny. Its size is just 0.275 nanometers! Because scientists don’t want to use fractional nanometer sizes for molecules, they invented a new size unit, specifically for particle physics, and called it “angstrom”.\n1 nanometer = 10 angstrom\n“The water molecule is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, in a ratio of two volumes of hydrogen for each volume of oxygen, with the molecular formula H2O and a molecular diameter of about 2.75 angstrom.”\nENLIST Chemistry Workshop, University of Illinois\nWater molecules are, in fact, the smallest molecules in the universe.\nNow, let’s check which size particles HEPA filters can collect:\n“To qualify as HEPA, the filter must remove 99.97% of particles down to 0.3 microns from air that passes through it.”\nair-purifier-power.com\nThis does NOT say a HEPA filter can’t collect particles smaller than 0.3µm! In fact, the smaller a particle is, the better it can be collected by a HEPA filter.\nHowever, the filtration efficiency apparently decreases once you go below a certain size.\nGas molecules (like water steam), are just a whole different size category on their own. They are so small, they just fly through HEPA filters without any obstructions.\nAnd that’s a positive result for you!\nSince water steam just passes through your air filter without interacting, a humidifier does not have any effect on your air purifier.\nHowever (and here’s the main setback of this article):\nHumidifiers do not emit steam! They emit water vapor.\nDo air purifiers filter water vapor? Water vapor is steam mixed with millions of tiny droplets of water. The droplets are what makes the vapor visible. Steam, in contrast, is invisible.\n“Steam in general refers to the gas phase of water. Steam can be the same as water vapor in some contexts. In more casual usage, steam can refer to the mixture of vapor and aerosol liquid water droplets suspended in the vapor.”\nJMac on physics.stackexchange.com\nHumidifiers emit visible water vapor. The vapor contains tiny water droplets.\nDepending on where you live, there are now two possible scenarios:\nIf you live in a dry place, the droplets in the water vapor will eventually vaporize and turn into steam. However, in humid places, the air already has high water content. So, vapor might not fully turn into steam. These droplets are large enough for a HEPA filter to catch.\nThe average diameter of a water droplet is 10 - 15 microns ( source).\nThat’s about 30.000 to 60.000 times the diameter of a water molecule!\nSo, while HEPA filters can’t catch water molecules, they can easily catch water droplets. In fact, water droplets are so large that HEPA filters will likely catch 100% of them.\nAn air purifier will catch all water droplets passing through it.\nThat’s not good!\nWhen water accumulates on your air filter, it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria and bad smells.\nAnd on top of that, the air purifier even dehumidifies the air you’re trying to humidity by absorbing all the water droplets!\nIntermediate result In hot and dry air, air purifiers and humidifiers do not interact, since the humidifier’s water droplets vaporize to steam.\nIn cold and humid air, air purifiers will filter the water droplets your humidifier emits. This makes humidifying pointless and increases bacteria growth on the air filter.\nOne more note I have to add here In humid air, where air purifiers and humidifiers would disturb each other, using a humidifier makes no sense anyways!\nIf you live in a humid place, you don’t need to run a humidifier.\nIn any (dry) place, where humidifiers make sense, it is no problem to combine them with an air purifier.\nIf too close together, your air purifier will pull in the vapor from your humidifier and absorb the water droplets. This effectively renders the humidifier useless and wears down the air purifier\u0026rsquo;s filter.\nHow to place an air purifier to use it together with your humidifier As long as you live in a dry place, water vapor coming from the humidifier eventually transforms into steam.\nHowever, this transformation takes a couple of seconds. Even in hot and dry places. You will always see water vapor coming from the humidifier initially.\nWhile the water is in its vapor stage, it should not get near the air purifier, since the filter would catch all the moisture.\nSo, the key learning from this section is:\nNever place an air purifier immediately next to a humidifier.\nIdeally, both devices should be as far apart as possible to minimize the likelihood of water droplets entering your air purifier.\nIn the summertime, it doesn’t matter where exactly you place your humidifier and your air purifier. Just place them at opposite ends of your room.\nIn the wintertime, however, water droplets evaporate less easily (because it’s so cold). Therefore, place your humidifier near a heat source, such as a wood stove, a radiator, or similar.\nThe heater helps the water coming from the humidifier evaporate. And once the water droplets are evaporated, your air purifier can’t filter them anymore.\nMost importantly, don’t place your humidifier in a cold corner of the room! In cold corners, even more, water vapor condenses into droplets, which in turn, makes evaporation even harder.\nDo humidifiers spike an air purifier’s power consumption? If you place your air purifier and your humidifier far apart, they don’t interact.\nAlso, humidifiers do not affect your air purifier’s power consumption.\nThe main power consumer in an air purifier is the built-in fan. Humidity does not affect the fan at all.\nA humidifier can only affect an air purifier if you place both devices right next to each other and the air purifier sucks up all the humidity from the humidifier. Humidity in the air filter would increase air resistance and spike the air purifier fan’s power consumption.\nFor that to happen, however, you need to intentionally do everything contrary to what you learned in this article (e.g. run the purifier and humidifier right next to each other in a high-humidity and cold environment).\nSo:\nNo, a humidifier does not affect the air purifier’s power consumption.\nCan humidifiers harm your air purifier’s electronics? Similarly, a humidifier does not affect your air purifier’s built-in electronics, as long as you don’t intentionally run both devices right next to each other.\nAs long as there is some space (say \u0026gt;10 feet) between both devices, an air purifier can not absorb the humidity from the humidifier.\nThe increase in relative air humidity does not harm the humidifier. It’s just too little water to affect the electronics.\nAlso, air purifiers are very simple devices. In principle, it’s a simple circuit board connected to a fan. Both the fan and the circuit board are embedded deep inside the air purifier.\nThey don’t just fail on accident. You’d have to intentionally do something wrong.\nFor an electronic failure to happen, you would need to pour water over your air purifier.\nDon’t try it!\nNo, a humidifier does not harm an air purifier’s electronics.\nConclusion You can run an air purifier and a humidifier together as long as there is a distance between both devices.\nAs long as you don’t run your humidifier in an environment that’s already humid (even without the humidifier), there is very little that can go wrong.\nOnly if you place your air purifier and humidifier right next to each other, your air purifier will suck up all the water droplets and accumulate moisture.\nThis would be a stupid idea. At least after reading this article.\nI hope I could help you.\nKudos: The guy explaining water vapor vs steam It took me some time to really understand what water vapor is. Especially, because scientific terms about phases and critical temperatures are totally confusing.\nAnd on top of that, the casual language understanding of steam and vapor differs.\nIn this article, I used the term vapor for gaseous water mixed with water droplets. And I used steam for purely gaseous water.\nI based my understanding on this phenomenally simple video.\n( Although I study thermodynamics at university, so I should know this without children’s science videos )\nThanks for explaining it, Mr. Wizard!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-run-air-purifier-and-humidifier-at-the-same-time/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you run an air purifier and a humidifier at the same time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did a quick Google search.

In this article, we’re going to check whether it makes sense to vent your room while you run your air purifier.\nActually, the answer is quite obvious: of course, you can run your air purifier.\nHowever, as soon as you open your window, particles like pollen and bacteria enter your room.\nIs that a reason to stop your air purifier? Should you wait until the window is closed to run it again?\nIs running an air purifier with an open window a waste of electricity?\nShould you open your window at all?(Yes!)\nI find it funny how such a simple question turns out to be so complex. To find a definite answer, you have to immerse yourself in physics, experiments about room air exchange rate, air purifier power consumption, and so much more.\nTo all these views, I want to add a different approach, a very systematic one. It’s going to be interesting!\nThe summarized answer:\nYes, you can run an air purifier with a window open. In most parts of the Western World, outdoor air is clean enough and the airstream can even help support indoor air purification. Of course, if you live in a polluted area, an open window acts as an infinite source of particles, which reduces your air purifier’s particle reduction rate and its filter lifetime.\nLet’s have a look at how we can inspect the problem systematically:\nCan you run an air purifier with a window open? Let’s postulate a couple of statements that we believe to be true.\nVenting is necessary. Venting creates an airflow inside your home. Outdoor air may be or not be polluted. Now, let’s investigate each of those statements in detail.\n1. Venting is inevitable As long as all your windows and doors are closed, your home is a closed space. Theoretically.\nIn practice, air leaks in through tiny gaps below doors, and windows, and through imperfect insulation.\nStill, indoor and outdoor air have a diminishingly low exchange rate if you don’t vent your room.\nOver time, moisture (from your breath, the shower, from cooking) accumulates indoors.\nThis moisture has to be vented!\nYou cannot healthily live at home without venting. Venting is mandatory.\n“My experience is unless there is heavy smog smoke or pollen it is always best to flush the home air with fresh air at least once a day.”\nDarkVandal on reddit\nSo, the question is NOT whether you can run your air purifier instead of venting your room. Air purifiers do not remove moisture, and they do not refresh oxygen levels.\nThe following statement is our guiding star:\nYou have to vent your room regardless of whether you run an air purifier or not.\nSo, here’s an interesting intermediate result:\nYou HAVE to vent your room, regardless of whether you use an air purifier. Your air purifier does NOT replace venting your room. Now, the question boils down to: Should I keep running my air purifier while the window is open or not?\n2. Venting creates an indoor airflow The smaller the particles in your room, the better a HEPA filter can collect them. That’s quite an interesting result.\n“The fact that a HEPA filter’s removal efficiency increases as particle size decreases below 0.3 microns is counterintuitive.”\nDonaldson Company\nIn the figure below, you can see the filtration efficiency for two different filter types, HEPA and FERENA filters. Interesting for us is just the blue curve for HEPA filters.\nAs you can see, the filtration efficiency has a minimum at a particle size of around 0.1 microns (= 100nm).\nfrom “Assessment of Capacity to Capture DNA Aerosols by Clean Filters for Molecular Biology Experiments” ( source)\nSo, the smaller the particles, the better a HEPA filter can collect them.\nNow, imagine your home has no air movement. Except for the absolutely smallest particles (which are suspended in the air due to their size and Brownian motion), most particles would settle down over time.\nIn a home with little airflow, these particles start clumping together, eventually sticking to larger particles and forming dust. Dust acts in itself like a filter, since it attracts particles.\nNow, dust particles are larger and, therefore, harder to collect by the HEPA filter.\nHere’s where venting enters the game:\nRegular venting creates an indoor airflow that lifts small particles up. An air purifier can pick up small floating particles easier than clumped-up larger particles.\nFollowing this logic, venting causes an indoor airflow that could even help your air purifier pick up those particles that stick to the floor, walls, or furniture due to electric charge.\nOf course, through venting, additional particles enter your home.\nAnd of course, an air purifier creates its own airflow as well. So this effect might be comparably small.\n3. Outdoor air may or may not be polluted When you open your window, outdoor air enters your room and indoor air leaves your room.\nIf you live in a rather rural area, or a couple miles from the next large city, outdoor air may not be as polluted as you think.\nLet’s have a look at the air quality map below.\nThe word air quality report ranks air quality worldwide.\nThe large majority of regions in the US and Western Europe are either blue (meets the WHO air quality guideline for PM2.5 particle concentration) or green (WHO air quality guidelines are surpassed by a factor of lower than 2).\nAustralia has very high air quality and is mostly tagged with blue quality markers.\nIn the yellow regions, air quality surpasses the WHO air quality guideline by a factor of 2 to 3.\nIf you compare that to dark red or even violet-colored India and Southeast Asia, you can tell our air is a lot better than theirs.\nSo, using an air purifier in the US, Western Europe or Australia might be good for picking up dust and particles from the air.\nBut it’s usually not a necessity.\nSo, what happens when you open your window?\nIf you’re in the US, Western Europe, or Australia, chances are, the outdoor air is less polluted than your indoor air. Venting, therefore, is just another way to purify the air.\nIn this case, it doesn’t matter whether you run your air purifier while the window is open.\nIf you are, however, in a polluted area, I recommend turning off your air purifier while the window is open. Here’s why:\nWhy you shouldn’t run your air purifier with a window open when the outdoors is polluted If the outdoor air is polluted where you live, and you run your air purifier with a window open, essentially the following happens:\nDirty air from the outdoors enters your room. Your air purifier collects the particles and blows the clean air outside.\nThe cycle repeats until your air purifier’s filters are full.\nWhen your window is open, it acts as an infinite source of pollution. Running your air purifier while it is connected through an air channel to infinite particles to filter is not a good idea.\nIt wears down your air purifier, and it accumulates pollution in your living space.\nNow, you can argue your air purifier cleans the dirty outdoor air and it’s no problem to vent. In principle that’s true. Of course, while your air purifier is running, indoor pollution levels decrease slightly.\nBut as long as more pollution constantly enters your room through the open window, your air purifier essentially fights against an infinitely large opponent. This wears down the filter and does not benefit you much.\nInstead:\nIn a polluted area, shut off your air purifier while venting. Limit the venting time. And let your air purifier clean the air after you close your windows.\nThis approach ensures that your air purifier does not blow any clean air outdoors. It does not collect more pollution than necessary. And you save a bit of electricity.\nAir purifier experiment results with open windows The guys from smartairfilters.com did the following pollution level measurements in their flat in Beijing.\nAs you can see, the red bar indicates that when your window is open, your air purifier only reduces particles by 59.6% (as compared to when it’s not running).\nWhen the window is closed, the reduction rate increases to 89.9%.\nI strongly assume the reason is the infinite inflow of new pollution (as explained in the previous section). Your air purifier just can’t keep up.\nRunning an air purifier with a window open reduces particle filtering efficiency. However, that’s only the case if you live in a polluted place.\nIf outdoor air was cleaner than indoor air (which is the case in many places), instead of a net inflow of particles, there would be a net outflow of particles, which could change this result drastically.\nIn which case you should keep your air purifier running while the window is open There is one case I can think of in which you should keep your air purifier running in combination with an open window:\nYou can run your air purifier with a window open if the source of pollution is indoors.\nFor example, the fastest way to get rid of smells from smoking, gases from strong cleaners, or from cooking, is to vent your room and run your air purifier at the same time.\nIn this case, air purification and air exchange add up.\nYour air purifier reduces the particle count, while venting removes smelly gases and moisture.\nHow much does running an air purifier with an open window cost? Opening the window while your air purifier is running decreases the particle reduction efficiency (as we’ve seen in the experiment earlier) if you live in a polluted place.\nHowever, it does not affect the air purifier’s running cost. An air purifier’s power consumption depends mainly on fan speed.\nAn open window does not affect the fan speed setting, and thus, it doesn’t affect the power consumption.\nI emphasize this, because for many devices, like heaters or air conditioners, an open window would affect power consumption. For example, if cold air enters your room, a heater (with built-in temperature control), would increase power consumption to hold the temperature steady.\nThat’s not the case for air purifiers. An air purifier has no kind of built-in control.\nAn average air purifier on “Medium” airspeed consumes 33W.\nLarger air purifiers, or air purifiers on the highest air speed setting, consume up to 60W of power.\nAt an average electricity rate of 16 cents per kWh, running an air purifier for one hour costs\n33W × 1 hour × 16 cents per kWh = 0.53 cents per hour\nSo, even if you vent your house for 1 hour a day, that would still waste less than $0.01.\nBut there’s a real cost we can associate with venting in polluted areas:\nFilter degradation cost The average HEPA 13 air purifier filter lasts 160 days if you use it for 8 hours a day. After that, the filter’s efficiency degrades to only 50%.\nThat amounts to a filter lifetime of\n160 days × 8 hours = 1280 hours of usage\nA good set of replacement filters (click to view it on amazon) costs $35.\nThat’s $17.50 per filter.\nBased on that you can associate a cost to each hour you use the filter:\n$17.50 / 1280 hours = 1.36 cents per filter-hour\n…\nOkay, honestly I expected it to be more. I am underwhelmed by the result.\nAnyways:\nThe total cost of running your air purifier per hour would then be\n1.36 cents + 0.53 cents = 1.86 cents\nSo:\nIn a polluted area, you’d waste 1.86 cents in electricity and filter costs per hour if you keep your air purifier running with a window open.\nInterpretation of the results Financially, running an air purifier is never going to make a large impact. Regardless of whether your windows are open or not.\nHowever, practically speaking, your filters last longer and you have to exchange them less frequently if you turn off your air purifier when windows are open.\nConclusion There’s no single right or wrong answer, unfortunately.\nHere’s my concluding guideline:\nShut off your air purifier when you open your windows if:\nyou live in a polluted area you vent for an extended time (\u0026gt;10 minutes) Keep your air purifier running if:\noutdoor air is clean - in this case, venting and air purification go hand in hand the source of pollution is indoors (from smoking, cooking, or cleaning) I hope this article was helpful!

But we don’t stop there. After reading this, you’ll not only know exactly if you can run your air purifier all day, but also whether it even makes sense.\nMy goal is not just to tell you what to do. A lot of search results are totally useless. For example, when I search for “Can you run an air purifier all day?”, the first result tells me “Yes”, but does not explain why. (I need a why!)\nAnother search result a bit further down tells me “No”, with the justification that it’s too expensive, while not telling me how much it costs!\nSo, how the heck can I make my own educated decision? It’s impossible.\nAnd here’s where this article comes in.\nI will answer everything you ever need to know about running your air purifier all day. And I provide numbers, facts, and figures. And, as always, human reasoning.\nI’ll try to keep everything simple and straightforward. You’ll know more about air purifiers than 95% of people at the end of this article.\nCan you run an air purifier 24/7?\nLet’s approach the question from a couple of different perspectives:\nthe technical perspective: is it technically possible to run an air purifier all day? the financial perspective: how much does running an air purifier all day cost? the self-questioning perspective: is there even a point in running an air purifier 24/7? Before all, let’s start with the quick answer!\nQuick answer: Yes, you can run an air purifier 24/7. Air purifiers run on low power and don’t overheat. The monthly running cost for a typical air purifier on “Medium” airspeed setting is $3.80. Usually, though, running your air purifier for more than 8 hours a day yields diminishing results and the particle-collection rate decreases.\nLet’s have an in-depth look:\nHow long can an air purifier run continuously? Electric devices (and machines in general) always have one weak spot: their moving parts. Anything that moves within a device, can’t run indefinitely. Over time, any moving part wears down.\nThe question is just: how long do the moving parts last?\nThe only moving part in an air purifier is the built-in fan. Also, you can think of the HEPA filter as a technically moving part, since it changes its physical properties (weight, volume, moisture, etc.) over time as it collects particles.\nIn high-power devices, let’s think of a racing car motor, the moving parts don’t last long at all. If you floor the gas pedal all the time, the motor has to withstand so much friction, it probably fails within a couple of hours.\nLuckily, this is not the case for air purifiers. Air purifiers are very low-power devices. So, there is very little friction inside it.\nDoes an air purifier fan withstand 24/7 running? The lifetime of fan bearings is roughly 50,000 hours.\n50,000 hours ÷ 24 hours per day ÷ 30 days per month ÷ 12 months a year ≈ 5.787 years ≈ 5 years and 9 months\nSo, an average fan inside an air purifier can run for 5 years and 9 months continuously.\nThat’s a lot!\nThe reason fans last so long, even though they do all the heavy lifting inside the air purifier, is that fans are incredibly optimized.\nManufacturers all around the world have been producing fans for cars, computers, ovens, etc. for decades. And each little improvement is copied by the competition.\nAir purifiers, just like bigger fans (in the background), can run for thousands of hours!\nHow long does the HEPA filter last? Of course, the built-in HEPA filter does not move. So, it does not wear down due to friction.\nOver time, however, a HEPA filter collects dust, which wears the HEPA filter down.\nGus from smartairfilters.com did an interesting experiment on how long a HEPA filter lasts using a particle counter.\nHe runs his air purifier every night. I assume he runs it at night because he is not at home during the daytime.\nAfter inserting a new HEPA filter, he measures the number of particles every day.\nThe results are:\n**Air purifier running time****Filter effectiveness (measured through the reduction in room particles)**0 days100%120 days90%160 days80%200 days50%\nHere’s the image with all measurements:\nThe effectiveness of HEPA filters reduces sharply after the 160 days mark. (experimental results from smartairfilters.com)\nAs you can see, after the 160 days mark, HEPA filters start becoming useless. They don’t technically fail (as if they suddenly stop working), but they appear to have a half-life.\nMy assumption would be that after 160 days, HEPA filters are so clogged with dust, that they just stop being effective.\nThe experiment was done in Beijing (where air pollution is high). Possibly, results in your area look a bit better.\nThese guys recommend replacing HEPA filters every 6 months. Which makes sense. However, since they run their air purifier overnight only (for 8 hours a day), it is possible that your air purifier collects more dust when you run it 24/7.\nWe will have a closer look at whether longer running times actually cause more particle collection later in this article. So stay tuned.\nStill, let’s stick to the general recommendation as a bottom line:\nYou should replace your HEPA filters at least twice a year!\nYes, you can technically run your air purifier 24/7. The built-in fan can run for years on end. You only have to exchange filters every 6 months.\nHow much does running an air purifier 24/7 cost? Let’s have a look at the financial aspect and open with the following quote:\n“I don\u0026rsquo;t think [air purifiers] cost that much to run 24/7 - but they\u0026rsquo;re worth their weight in gold to me.”\nTFW46 (forum member)\nIt seems that people like air purifiers a lot. Let’s put a number on air purifier running cost.\nI’ve written an extensive article about air purifier running costs just yesterday! So, let me conclude the findings for running an air purifier 24/7.\nAt an average electricity rate of 16 cents per kWh, an average 33W air purifier costs:\n$0.13 per day (24 hours) $3.80 per month (30 days) $46.25 per year (365 days) An average air purifier is rated at 33W. That\u0026rsquo;s very little in comparison to other household devices.\nA set of two replacement filters usually costs between $20 and $50. Original replacement parts are more expensive, while aftermarket replacement parts are cheap.\nThis adds a fixed average cost of $35 to the yearly running cost if you replace filters twice a year.\nThe total cost to run an air purifier 24/7, including electricity and filter replacements is $81.25.\nDoes night mode reduce running cost? In night mode, air purifiers consume a lot less electricity. An average 33W air purifier’s power consumption reduces to 10W in night mode, according to an amazon reviewer named Melody Reed, who measured the power consumption of the Levoit Core 300S (my favorite air purifier) using a Kilowatt-meter.\nIf you run your air purifier in night mode (at 10 Watts) for 8 hours of the day and at “Medium” (33 Watts) for the remaining 16 hours, your running cost reduces to\n( 16 hours × 33W + 8 hours × 10W ) ÷ ( 24 hours × 33W ) ≈ 76.7%\nNight mode reduces your air purifier’s power consumption by 23.4%.\nIt’s safe to conclude running an air conditioner 24/7 is not expensive. Night mode helps cut the cost even further.\nBut is there a point in running an air purifier all day? Now that we know that you can technically run an air purifier all day and that it won’t cost you much, let’s have a look at the final question:\nDoes it make sense?\nJust because something is technically possible and affordable to do, does not mean you should do it.\nLet the questioning begin:\nDoes running an air purifier in night mode even make sense? If you run your air purifier 24/7, you likely use night mode to reduce the noise and power consumption.\nHere are my thoughts:\nAn air purifier can collect particles easily when they float around. You need very little airflow to suck in floating particles.\nThe more movement there is in the air in your home, the more particles float around.\nDuring the night, particles tend to settle. Of course, most floating particles are so lightweight, they settle very slowly. So, we speak about tiny effects.\nTo collect the same number of particles at night as during daytime, you need more airflow. Not much more, but a little more.\nIn night mode, the air purifier reduces air speed to roughly a third of the “Low” setting.\nSo, yes, night mode does work and, yes, the air purifier does collect particles at night. However, the particle collection rate is reduced a lot.\nNight mode only makes sense if you have an allergy or asthma, or if you live in a high-pollution area and sleep with your window open.\nIn all other cases, running an air purifier during the daytime should be more than enough.\nDoes running an air purifier when you\u0026rsquo;re not at home make sense \u0026amp; is it safe? Yes, you can run your air purifier when you’re not at home. I’d even argue that it makes a lot of sense to do so.\nWhen you return home, the air is as fresh as it gets and you don’t have to wait for the air purifier to do its job.\nTechnically, it’s absolutely safe to run your air purifier in your absence. Since most home air purifiers consume under 60W of power, they can’t overheat, meltdown cords, or cause fuses to trip.\nAccording to the formula\nCurrent (in Amps) = Power (in Watts) ÷ Voltage (in Volts)\nthe maximum current a strong 60W air purifier draws from a regular 120V US wall outlet is:\n60 Watts ÷ 120V = 0.5 Amps\nOn European 230V wall outlets, the amperage is even lower:\n60 Watts ÷ 230V ≈ 0.26 Amps\nConsidering some phone chargers draw up to 2 Amps, the amperage of an air purifier is very low.\nDo air purifiers running 24/7 collect more particles? Yes, the more you run your air purifier the more particles, aerosols, and bacteria it will collect.\nHowever, the difference might not be worth it.\nFor example, if you run your air purifier for 16 hours a day, that’s a running time reduction of 33% as compared to running it all day.\nThat does not mean that your air purifier particle reduction reduces by 33%. Rather the following is true:\nThere is a large portion of particles in your home that are easy to collect. These are the particles floating around in the air. They are the “low-hanging fruit”.\nI’d estimate 80% of particles belong in this category.\nYour air purifier filters those particles within the first couple of hours of running it. After those first few hours, the majority of easy-to-collect particles are already filtered.\nThat’s what the first, say, 4-8 hours, of running time get you.\nAfter that, there remain just a couple of hard-to-collect particles. These are hard to collect because they are at the far end of your room. Or they stick to objects in your room because of an electrical charge.\nFor the remaining 16 hours of your day, an air purifier is busy trying to collect the 20% of particles, which make up 80% of the work.\nRunning an air purifier for increasing time periods yields diminishing returns.\nAfter running your air purifier for 8 hours, the majority of particles in the air in your living space are filtered. Any running time beyond that will collect fewer and fewer particles.\nThe touch panel of an air purifier allows you to set a timer up to 8 hours. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s an indicator that running times beyond 8 hours don\u0026rsquo;t make much sense.\nDo not run your air purifier all day because you fear dust and bacteria Air purifiers are great for collecting dust and freshening the air. However, you should not run your air purifier all day for health reasons.\n“Unless you live on a building site, or the air quality is really that bad, an air purifier is unlikely to \u0026ldquo;protect\u0026rdquo; [you or] your child in any meaningful way”\nCashStrapped\nFirst and foremost, the pollution levels in most places do not justify running your air purifier all day.\nRemember the HEPA filter experiment we looked at earlier: 8 hours of filtering were enough. And the experimenter lives in Beijing, a city with much higher pollution than almost anywhere in the US or Europe.\nActually, running your air purifier all day creates a negative spiral. It worsens your immune system, which, in turn, forces you to run your air purifier more.\n“Living in a dust-free, artificially clean environment will just make you or your child more susceptible to everyday pollution as soon as you or he steps outside the house.”\nmatelodave\nI do not recommend running your air purifier all day.\nConclusion Yes, you can run an air purifier 24/7. However, running your air purifier for increasing time every day yields diminishing air purification results. Usually, 8 hours of running time a day is more than enough to clean the average home.\nAlso, do not fear the pollen. Making your home overly sterile helps nobody and actually has an impact on your immune system.\nYou should avoid using an air purifier all day for health reasons. Instead, use it to have fresher, less smelly air in your room, and to collect dust.\nThat’s where air purifiers shine.\nI hope this article helped you!

And if you’re too lazy to calculate things on your own, I will just point you to your personalized result!\nHow much Power does an Air Purifier consume? Different electric devices consume different amounts of power. So, before we can calculate anything, we first have to find out how much power a typical air purifier consumes.\nMy favorite, and, by far the #1 best-selling air purifier is the Levoit Core 300S (click here to view my review). It consumes 33W.\nThe power rating of an air purifier is easy to spot on the technical-details label. There it says \u0026ldquo;Rated Power: 33W\u0026rdquo;\nLet’s have a look at different air purifiers and their wattages:\nAir Purifier Model****How much power does it consume? (in Watts)****Room size covered (in square feet)Levoit Core Mini7 Watts356 sq. ft.Levoit Core 300S33 Watts1,095 sq. ft.Levoit Core 600S49 Watts3,175 sq. ft.Germ Guardian55 Watts743 sq. ft.Dyson Pure Cool TP0156 Watts1,500 sq. ft.\nBy the way: Finding the wattages of Dyson air purifiers was really hard. They are not listed anywhere and I had to dig the internet for their technical specification.\nI guess that’s because Dyson advertises their energy efficiency so much. But when you measure wattages, you see that they are no better than other brands.\nLevoit and Germ Guardian happily list their wattages everywhere for comparison.\nAs you can see, different air purifiers consume different wattages.\nI also added a column that lists the room sizes covered by the different air purifiers. And very surprisingly to me, it appears that wattage is not directly linked to room size covered.\nWhile Levoit Core air purifiers cover more area, the stronger they get, the Germ Guardian and the Dyson Pure both consume more power than the other purifiers, but cover less area.\n( I’d say that is a thumbs-up for Levoit )\nA typical air purifier consumes 30 - 40 Watts of power. Small models can consume as little as 7 Watts, while larger models consume 50W or more.\nPower usage by filter type All five air purifiers in the list above use HEPA 13 filters. This means that different filters don’t explain their different electricity usage.\nBut technically, different filters would cause different power consumption. A filter, in principle, resists airflow and only allows extremely fine particles to pass.\nSo, the finer your air filter works, the harder it usually is for air to pass through it. Which has an impact on power consumption.\nSince almost all air purifiers on the market use standardized HEPA 13 filters, the filters don’t explain the differing power consumption.\nBut if you ever switch out the HEPA filter for a less fine-grained one, you should see a drop in power usage.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a typical air purifier filter. Different filters allow for different airspeeds!\nHow Does Fan Speed Affect Power Consumption? Another factor that impacts the power consumption is, of course, the fan speed. So, the more air your purifier forces through the filter, the more power it consumes.\nOne nice user (named Melody Reed) measured the power consumption of his Levoit Core 300S air purifier using a Kilowatt-meter and put the results in their amazon review. (Thank you!)\n**Airflow setting****Power consumption (in Watts)**Low27 WattsMedium32 WattsHigh47 WattsNight mode10 Watts\nSo, the higher the setting, the more power your air purifier consumes. Makes sense.\nAnd, interestingly, on night mode an air purifier consumes just about a third of the power of “Low” mode. I wonder if night mode even collects any significant dust.\nOne more important finding is that on “High”, the Levoit Core 300S consumes 47 Watts, which is more than the 33 Watts usually specified for it.\nApparently, the wattages of some air purifiers are just average values. And if you run your air purifier at “High” speed, it consumes significantly more.\nIn this example, an air purifier consumes roughly 42.4% more power when you run it on the highest setting as compared to the medium setting.\nThat’s quite a jump!\n( My calculation here was 47 Watts ÷ 33 Watts ≈ 1.4242, which corresponds to a 42.4% increase)\nIf you flip the reasoning around, this means you can save 42.4% on your air purifier’s electricity bill by reducing the airflow setting from “High” to “Medium”.\nOn the Levoit Core 300 air purifier, you have 3 air speeds to choose from, plus night mode. I am running on air speed 1 right now.\nElectricity consumption of air purifiers by running time So far we’ve checked the power consumption of air purifiers. Now, with that power consumption, you can find out how much electric energy your air purifier consumes.\nFor anyone who’s not familiar with the difference between power and energy:\nPower consumption is the rate at which a device consumes energy. For example, an air purifier consumes 33 Watts of power. That’s similar to the horsepower in a car. You don’t pay for horsepower but for gallons of fuel consumed. Similarly, you don’t pay for power, but for total electric energy consumed.\nThe longer you run your air purifier, the more energy it consumes.\nElectric energy consumed (in Watt-hours) = Power (in Watt) × Time (in hours)\nAfter 1 hour, a 33W air purifier, therefore, consumes\n33 Watts × 1 hour = 33 Watt-hours\nA thousand Watt-hours (Wh) make up one Kilowatt-hour (kWh). So, you can divide the result by 1,000 to get the Kilowatt-hours consumed:\nKilowatt-hours = Watt-hours ÷ 1000\nOn your electricity bill, you are charged for the Kilowatt-hours consumed. So, that’s why it’s useful to convert from Wh to kWh. For example:\n33 Wh = 0.033 kWh\nSo, let’s create a complete table of air purifier electricity consumption by running time:\nThe left column specifies the power consumption of the air purifier. And each column to the right lists the total electricity consumption (in Watt-hours) after running it for 1 hour, 8 hours, or 24 hours.\nElectricity consumption by running time1h8h24h10 W0.010 kWh0.080 kWh0.240 kWh20 W0.020 kWh0.160 kWh0.480 kWh30 W0.030 kWh0.240 kWh0.720 kWh40 W0.040 kWh0.320 kWh0.960 kWh50 W0.050 kWh0.400 kWh1.200 kWh60 W0.060 kWh0.480 kWh1.440 kWh\nAs you can see, the more power your air purifier consumes, and the longer you run it, the higher your total electricity consumption.\nSince you are paying for electricity by the Kilowatt-hour, let’s have a look at how much electricity costs next.\nHow Much Does Electricity Cost? Electricity prices vary a lot within the US. Here’s a table with the latest US-wide electricity rates ( source):\nStateElectricity rate (in USD Cents per kWh)Alabama14.51Alaska24.86Arizona14.3Arkansas12.31California29.78Colorado14.37Connecticut31.32Delaware16.65District of Columbia17.08Florida15.22Georgia14Hawaii42.26Idaho10.79Illinois17.86Indiana15.12Iowa14.18Kansas14.09Kentucky12.53Louisiana11.69Maine29.26Maryland16.08Massachusetts29.01Michigan18.56Minnesota15.17Mississippi14.09Missouri12.46Montana12.82Nebraska11.88Nevada17.43New Hampshire30.67New Jersey17.18New Mexico13.3New York20.47North Carolina13.22North Dakota11.7Ohio15.49Oklahoma11.83Oregon12.95Pennsylvania18.26Rhode Island26.92South Carolina14.38South Dakota12.99Tennessee12.34Texas14.49Utah10.85Vermont21.03Virginia15.27Washington11.18West Virginia14.63Wisconsin17.33Wyoming11.93U.S. Total16.14\nThe US average electricity rate is currently about $0.16 per kWh.\nBut, as you can see, the rate varies a lot from around $0.10 in a lot of states (Mississippi, Washington, Tennessee, and many more) up to \u0026gt;$0.3 in New Hampshire and Connecticut.\nSo, please look up the electricity rate in your state and note it somewhere!\nI’ll create a table later on where you can look up your air purifier’s electricity cost based on where you are.\nOr alternatively, you can do your own full calculation and factor in your exact electricity rate, running time, and air purifier wattage.\nTo get your exact electricity rate, you can check your latest electricity bill. Here’s where to lookup your electricity rate:\nSample electricity bill and where to lookup your electricity rate - bill layouts differ by provider, but you should know what you’re looking for now!\nHow Much Does an Air Purifier Cost to Run? Now you know everything to calculate your air purifier running cost with absolute precision.\nSo, first, let me layout the formula you can use.\n( If you hate maths, you can skip to the table down below to see the running cost of a typical air purifier. )\nThe formula for calculating running costs is straightforward:\nRunning Cost = Electricity Rate (in $ per kWh) x Running Time (in hours) x Power Consumption (in Watts) ÷ 1,000\nIf you want to calculate your personal air purifier running cost you need:\nyour air purifier’s wattage: you can find it on a label on the air purifier your personal electricity rate: either use the average value for your state from the table in the previous section, or look it up in your last electricity bill the running time: use 1 hour to find out the hourly running cost of your air purifier, or use 24 hours to calculate a full day, etc. I did all the calculations so you don’t have to! Here’s the average air purifier running cost per US state (for a regular 33 Watts air purifier):\nStates****Hourly running cost for typical 33W air purifierAlabama0.48 centsAlaska0.82 centsArizona0.47 centsArkansas0.41 centsCalifornia0.98 centsColorado0.47 centsConnecticut1.03 centsDelaware0.55 centsDistrict of Columbia0.56 centsFlorida0.50 centsGeorgia0.46 centsHawaii1.39 centsIdaho0.36 centsIllinois0.59 centsIndiana0.50 centsIowa0.47 centsKansas0.46 centsKentucky0.41 centsLouisiana0.39 centsMaine0.97 centsMaryland0.53 centsMassachusetts0.96 centsMichigan0.61 centsMinnesota0.50 centsMississippi0.46 centsMissouri0.41 centsMontana0.42 centsNebraska0.39 centsNevada0.58 centsNew Hampshire1.01 centsNew Jersey0.57 centsNew Mexico0.44 centsNew York0.68 centsNorth Carolina0.44 centsNorth Dakota0.39 centsOhio0.51 centsOklahoma0.39 centsOregon0.43 centsPennsylvania0.60 centsRhode Island0.89 centsSouth Carolina0.47 centsSouth Dakota0.43 centsTennessee0.41 centsTexas0.48 centsUtah0.36 centsVermont0.69 centsVirginia0.50 centsWashington0.37 centsWest Virginia0.48 centsWisconsin0.57 centsWyoming0.39 centsU.S. Total****0.53 cents\nAs you can see, air purifiers are incredibly cheap to run. In most states, you don’t even pay a cent per hour!\nSo, let’s have a look (based on the US average electricity rate) how much running an air purifier costs for longer time periods:\nRunning time****Average 33W air purifier running cost1 hour$0.018 hours$0.0424 hours$0.1330 days (8 hours per day)$1.2730 days (24 hours per day)$3.80\nEven if you run your air purifier 24/7, it costs just $3.80 per month.\nFactoring in air purifier maintenance cost (Replacing filters) The actual running cost of an air purifier is not just its electricity consumption. Much more significant expenses are the initial buying cost of an air purifier and getting replacement filters.\nDepending on the model, buying a new air purifier costs anywhere between $50 - $200. And getting good replacement filters also costs you $20 - $50.\nSo, the true running cost of an air purifier is:\nAir purifier running cost = Initial purchasing price + Replacement air filters + Electric running cost\nwhere the initial purchase price and replacement filters make up the majority of the expenses.\nFor the running cost, however, we should ignore the purchasing price and just look at the electricity cost and filter replacement cost.\nTrue air purifier running cost The true running cost (after your initial air purifier purchase) is your maintenance cost + electricity cost.\nHere’s an example:\nAt an average electricity rate, you use an average 33W air purifier. Every year, you spend $35 for a set of 2 replacement filters.\nIf you run your air purifier for 8 hours a day, this means you pay:\n$1.27 electricity cost per month × 12 months a year + 35$ a year for filters = $50.24 per year\nThe total yearly running and maintenance cost of an average air purifier is $50.24 per year.\nAt $35, the maintenance cost makes up almost 70% of the total expenses.\nHow to minimize Air Purifier Running Cost Let’s have a quick look at how to minimize electricity usage and maintenance cost of an air purifier.\nHow to minimize electricity usage Actually, you don’t need to minimize your air purifier’s electric running cost. In most states, an air purifier costs less than a cent to run per hour.\nLooking strictly at electricity consumption, the only thing you can do is to run your air purifier on moderate airflow settings.\nAs you’ve seen in a previous section, the “High” airflow setting consumes 42% more electricity than the “Medium” setting.\nSo, if you really want to save a dollar or two per month, you should reduce your airflow setting.\nReduce maintenance and replacement cost You can’t do much about the purchasing price of an air purifier. But what you can do is to reduce the frequency at which you buy new air purifiers.\nThe longer your air purifier’s lifetime, the lower your running cost is per year. You can only maximize lifetime by\ngetting a high-quality air purifier upfront (such as the Levoit Core series - click to read my review) getting good quality filters such as these HEPA 13 filters (click here to view them on amazon) Also, you can extend the lifetime of your filters by not replacing them every time they are full.\nEvery once in a while, instead of replacing filters, brush the dust off with a soft and dry toothbrush.\nUnfortunately, you can’t wash HEPA filters. I think some people do, but I am sure this breaks the air purification feature of your air purifier. It might still collect dust, but it won’t collect smaller microparticles after washing.\nReplacing air purifier filters is incredibly easy. Just open the bottom part, and put in the new filter!\nConclusion Air purifiers are very cheap to run, looking strictly at electricity cost. If you factor in the maintenance cost of replacing HEPA filters regularly, you get a completely different result.\nFilter replacements make up roughly 70% of an air purifiers maintenance cost.\nBut since electricity is so cheap, I wouldn’t save on filters. The filters are the core component of your air purifier.\nThey do all the work.\nSo, get good filters regularly. And don’t worry about electricity expenses - they are almost negligible.\nI hope this article was helpful!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/air-purifier-running-cost-guide/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow much does an Air Purifier cost to run?

Personally, I hate marketing tricks and lies. And if you read my other articles on this website, I always prefer simplicity and sturdiness over shiny objects that can’t hold their promises.\nSo, this time, let’s have a look at my favorite air purifier and why I decided to get this one.\nQuick answer: The best air purifier is the Levoit Core 300. It is simple, collects a lot of dust and is easy to maintain. After using it for a month and seeing the thickness of dust it collects, it is evident why this air purifier is so popular.\nBest Air Purifier: The Levoit Core 300 My favorite air purifier is the Levoit Core 300 (click here to view it on amazon). It does a perfect job at collecting dust from the air in your room, it’s quiet, and you can get plenty of specialized air filters for it!\nWith over 99,000 reviews on amazon (4.7 stars), it is the #1 best selling air purifier.\nUsually, I don’t just pick the best seller of a given product. But the Levoit Core 300 really appears to set the standard for other air purifier brands.\nA lot of other air purifiers imitate the design of Levoit. Which is why so many air purifiers look similar.\nWhy I picked the Levoit Core 300 over the Levoit Core 300S There are two popular variants of this air purifier. One is the Core 300, the other is the Core 300S.\nThe only difference between the two is that the Core 300S integrates with smart home apps like Alexa or Google Assistant and you can control it with your phone.\nI am a really pragmatic person and I don’t need to automate and control things via phone.\nI just want air purification. So, I decided to get the Core 300.\nIt still got all the features you need, sleep mode, timer, and fan levels. You just have to set them manually via the touchpad.\nThe Core 300S and Core 300 both do the exact same air purification job. They have the same HEPA particle filters and both collect identical amounts of dust.\nAnd they look exactly the same.\nSo, both the Core 300S and the Core 300 are equally great choices. I am a simple guy, so I decided to get the Core 300.\nSometimes, either the Core 300 or the Core 300S are sold out. In that case, just get the available one. It really doesn’t make a difference.\nWhy the Levoit Core 300 Models are the Best Air Purifiers The Levoit Core 300 series is a top pick for a reason - it\u0026rsquo;s designed with a robust and modern aesthetic.\nThe models are built to withstand a fall, so a minor accident won\u0026rsquo;t leave you with a broken air purifier.\nIdeal size and purifying strength for most homes Size-wise, it\u0026rsquo;s perfect for most people. It\u0026rsquo;s capable of purifying a space up to 1095 sq. ft. (101m²), which is about the size of a large apartment. This is more than enough for most people.\nIf you have a larger living space, you can get one of the larger models in the Core series, like the Core 400 and Core 600. Personally, though, I think a distributed approach is better.\nPlacing multiple Core 300 units throughout your house is better than having one strong Core 600 in some corner from which it can’t collect particles from the far end of your house.\nSo, even in a large home, having multiple Core 300 models is better than one strong air purifier.\nQuietness One of the highlights of the Core 300 series is how quiet they run. With a noise level of 22dB in sleep mode, they are almost inaudible.\nPlus, they come with top certifications, including Energy Star, FCC, ETC, and CARB. These certifications verify the product\u0026rsquo;s energy efficiency, electrical safety, and compliance with California\u0026rsquo;s strict air cleaner regulations.\nOn the Levoit Core 300 touch panel, you can set night mode for extra quiet operation (the moon sign). Also, you can set a timer (in the picture, it\u0026rsquo;s set to 4 hours)\nGreat filters and plenty of replacement options Levoit\u0026rsquo;s original 3-stage HEPA filter can capture 0.3-micrometer particles, which is very good. But honestly, any HEPA filter can do that. You’re not limited to Levoit here (see the next section for why you might not need a Levoit air purifier).\nThe Core-series also advertises a high-efficiency activated carbon filter with more carbon than other brands. Although, here I also have to say that more carbon does not necessarily prove better air purification.\nMuch more important would be the carbon’s total surface area, which does not necessarily increase with mass. I’d love to see data on that. But in principle, more is better!\nThe Core 300 series operates at 140CFM (238m³/h), which may seem low compared to a (strong) floor fan\u0026rsquo;s 5,100 CFM, but remember, a fan doesn\u0026rsquo;t filter the air.\nIncredibly low power consumption At a power consumption of 33W and with four fan speed levels, it\u0026rsquo;s energy-efficient. To put it into perspective, even at its highest level, the cost of running the Core 300 is under 1 cent per hour.\n( Assuming an average electricity rate of 23 cents per kWh )\nWhat I really like is that you can easily customize the Core 300 with different filters, including a smoke remover filter, a pet allergy filter, or a toxin absorber filter.\nWhy you might not need a Levoit Core 300 The main job of any air purifier is done by the HEPA filter and the power of the airflow. Technically, any air purifier with a quality HEPA filter and decent fan can do a similar job.\nSo, if you find a more affordable option with a reliable filter and satisfactory airflow, it is likely enough.\nHowever, when you get cheaper air purifiers, you likely will have to tradeoff material quality and looks.\nA lot of other air purifiers look significantly cheaper.\nAnd Levoit really stands out with its \u0026gt;99,000 positive customer reviews.\nSo, I’d say.\nGetting a Levoit Core 300 should be the default air purifier choice, since we have social proof most people love them and they work reliably.\nHowever, if you are really short on money, get cheaper air purifiers. For example, this air purifier set (click here to view it on amazon) is a lot cheaper when compared to Levoit’s purifiers.\nThey use the same HEPA 13 filters and have equally good reviews. To me, they look a little more fragile and like a Levoit knockoff.\nBut I bet the air purification end result will be similar!\nMaintenance and Lifespan Let\u0026rsquo;s not forget about maintenance, a crucial aspect of any product. As a new user of the Levoit Core 300, I did my research and found that its filters need to be replaced every 6-8 months, depending on the level of air pollution in your home. Although this might seem like a hassle, it ensures that the air purifier continues to perform at its peak, keeping your air fresh and clean.\nWarranty Details Levoit provides a 1-year warranty for the Core 300 model, which I found comforting as a buyer. This shows the company\u0026rsquo;s confidence in their product and gives you peace of mind.\nFAQs Here are a few common questions you might have about the Levoit Core 300:\nQ: Does the Levoit Core 300 emit ozone?\nA: No, it\u0026rsquo;s 100% ozone-free, making it safe for you and your family.\nQ: How often should I run my air purifier?\nA: For best results, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to run your air purifier continuously. However, you can adjust this based on your needs and the air quality in your home.\nQ: Can I wash and reuse the filters of the Levoit Core 300?\nA: No, the filters are not washable. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to replace them every 6-8 months for optimal performance.\nBut it is certainly possible to brush off the dust with a dry brush every once in a while!\nConclusion In conclusion, choosing an air purifier comes down to your personal needs and budget.\nThe Levoit Core 300 stands out with its robust design, performance, and versatility, all at a reasonable price point.\nAlthough I don’t have my Levoit Core 300 for a long time, it is absolutely clear to me why this air purifier is so highly rated and loved by so many customers.\nEven if you\u0026rsquo;re considering cheaper options, remember that quality and reliability are worth investing in for the long run.\nUltimately, a product like the Levoit Core 300 can significantly improve the air quality in your home, and is absolutely worth it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-air-purifier/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI like to stick to products that simply work.

Whether it\u0026rsquo;s on the list of top swamp coolers for garages or in our swamp cooler vs air conditioner comparison, the MC37M stands out. But why?\nQuick answer: The best swamp cooler is the Hessaire MC37M. It is robust, has more than enough power to cool even large spaces, and lasts a lifetime. For smaller rooms, you can get the MC18M model.\nYou can check out the swamp cooler here: Hessaire MC37M (click here to view it on amazon).\nWhy the Hessaire MC37M is the best swamp cooler First and foremost, I am in no way affiliated with Hessaire as a brand.\nIf you know my other posts on this website, you know I am always technically precise and don’t care about brands. For reference, one of my most-read posts is one, where I roast Dyson heaters and prove how they are a waste of money.\nThe MC37M just stands out from the rest of the swamp coolers in every relevant way. There is no marketing, I’ve never seen a single Hessaire ad. This swamp cooler is simply good.\nAnd that’s the kind of product I like. No hype, no marketing lies. Just a solid, sturdy product.\nLet’s have a look.\nRobust design - lasts a long time First up, as I’ve just indicated, it\u0026rsquo;s sturdy. The MC37M\u0026rsquo;s main material is plastic, but that\u0026rsquo;s not a bad thing.\nEven though it’s counterintuitive, good swamp coolers have to be made of plastic.\nCompared to metal coolers that start rusting almost immediately, this cooler doesn\u0026rsquo;t have such problems.\nPlus, it\u0026rsquo;s well-built and lasts long without costing a fortune.\nStrong airflow The MC37M is more than just a robust cooler. Its 3,100 CFM fan is strong—almost as strong as a floor fan. Yet, it pushes this much air through a water-soaked pad. Most other swamp coolers online offer around 2,000 CFM, while others don\u0026rsquo;t even mention their rating (which probably means it\u0026rsquo;s lower).\nThere’s an even larger variant, the Hessaire MC61M (click to view it on amazon), which blows 5,100 CFM.\nBut unless you work in a large garage or at a construction site you likely don’t need a model that strong.\nFor most uses, the MC37M is more than enough.\nIn fact, the MC37M is strong enough to even cool you outdoors!\n“When this arrived, I took it out of the box immediately, very simply hook the hose up to it, filled the reservoir, and turned it on, and what a dramatic difference it made on the patio. With the outside air temperature at 115°F It was like an oven when the air was on you but when the blower turned your way and the cool air hit you what a difference it made!!!!! My chickens and dogs are going to be so happy now [\u0026hellip;]“ Melrae (reviewer)\nManual or automated water refills In my experience, this cooler is easy to use.\nYou can either run it off the built-in 10-gallon water tank. The tank lasts about 3-4 hours if you run your swamp cooler on full power. Or you can connect it to a water tap for a continuous refill.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using the continuous refill feature, I recommend adding this pressure reducer (click here to view it on amazon) to your garden hose.\nIt is not necessary, but it makes adjusting the water valve easier.\nIt slows down the tank filling process and reduces splashing.\nSize Considerations For most use cases, such as cooling large living rooms, or a 3-4 cars garage, the Hessaire MC37M has just the right size.\nYou can even use it outdoors.\nKeep in mind that the MC37M is not a small unit. For smaller spaces, consider its smaller sibling, the Hessaire MC18M. It\u0026rsquo;s more compact but still powerful.\nWe’re going to have a look at this small-brother model a bit later in this article!\nTechnical details Technical specs matter, and the MC37M shines here too. Its 3,100 CFM airflow surpasses many models. And with a power consumption of 250 watts, it\u0026rsquo;s economical. At an average electricity rate of 22 cents per kWh, it costs about 5.5 cents per hour to run.\nMC37M featuresMaterialRoto-molded plasticDurabilityHighAirflow3,100 CFMPower consumption250 WattsOperating cost~5.5 cents per hourCooling spaceUp to 750 square feetSizeSuitable for larger spacesAlternative for smaller spacesHessaire MC18MRefillsAutomated refills by connecting it to a tap, or manual refills using the built-in 10-gallon water tankValue for MoneyHigh\nWhy Spending more on the Hessaire MC37M is worth it Yes, the MC37M costs a bit more than other swamp coolers. But the extra cost is worth it.\nCheap coolers often break down easily and don\u0026rsquo;t perform as well. But with the MC37M, you get a durable, high-performance unit.\nSo, the Hessaire MC37M is my top pick. It\u0026rsquo;s durable, powerful, efficient, and worth every penny. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a swamp cooler, consider this model - you won\u0026rsquo;t regret it.\nAlternative for smaller spaces (Hessaire MC18M) While the Hessaire MC37M is an excellent choice for larger spaces, what about those of us who live in smaller rooms?\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry; Hessaire has got you covered there too, with the MC18M.\nThis is the MC18M!\nThe Hessaire MC18M shares a lot of the robust design and performance features of its bigger brother, the MC37M.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also made of the same durable plastic, ensuring a long life and resistance to rust.\nHowever, it comes in a smaller, more space-friendly package, making it the ideal choice for those working with less square footage.\nIn terms of performance, the MC18M can not match the powerful 3,100 CFM airflow of the MC37M.\nThe MC18M provides 1,300 CFM of airflow.\nThat’s significantly below what the MC37M offers. That’s why I generally prefer the MC37M.\nThough the exact room size the MC18M can cool will depend on a number of factors (like external temperature, humidity, and room insulation), it\u0026rsquo;s typically recommended for spaces up to 500 square feet.\nThat makes it perfect for spaces like small garages, home offices, or bedrooms.\nIn summary, if your cooling needs are on a smaller scale, the Hessaire MC18M is a swamp cooler well worth considering.\nIt brings the high-quality construction and efficient cooling of the Hessaire brand into a compact and budget-friendly package.\nWhy you might not need a Hessaire swamp cooler While I absolutely swear by the Hessaire MC37M for its strength, efficiency, and durability, it might not be the perfect fit for everyone.\nYes, you read it right. Not everything that glitters is gold for everyone, and the MC37M is no exception.\nFirst of all, at around $360, the MC37M is not cheap. It’s an investment, and not everyone might be ready to shell out this kind of cash for a swamp cooler.\nIf you’re on a tight budget, this might be a point of contention.\nAlso, the 250 watts power consumption is not much when compared to air conditioners, but it\u0026rsquo;s still a cost to consider. The MC37M can run up to 5.5 cents an hour. Comparatively, a good floor fan, which consumes between 80W to 120W, would cost you about half as much to run.\nA good quality floor fan can deliver as much air as the MC37M, but without the additional operating costs or maintenance.\nBecause, let\u0026rsquo;s face it, swamp coolers do need regular maintenance. If neglected, they can start to smell, which is a scenario no one wants to encounter.\nHere’s a guide on how to fix swamp cooler smell (you’ll have to do that regularly if you decide to get a swamp cooler).\nSo yes, the MC37M demands not only your money but also your time. From cleaning to filling the water tank and making sure it runs smoothly, the unit needs your attention.\nThat’s not really an issue with the MC37M in particular. Rather, it’s something all swamp coolers have in common.\nLastly, there are cheaper swamp coolers available in local stores or online, falling under the $100 mark.\nHowever, I\u0026rsquo;d warn you against them. From my experience, a quality fan usually outperforms a cheap swamp cooler in terms of reliability, convenience, and longevity.\nA strong fan might be enough for you This high-velocity floor fan (click here to view it on amazon) costs just under $70 and provides an airflow of 5,300 CFM. That’s more than any swamp cooler listed in this article!\nMeanwhile, it consumes just 145 watts of power.\nIn a nutshell, if you are seeking a no-fuss, low-maintenance, and budget-friendly solution for your cooling needs, the Hessaire MC37M might not be your best option.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to invest in a powerful, efficient cooler and can take out the time for its upkeep, then the MC37M is the real deal.\nConclusion To summarize, the best swamp cooler is the Hessaire MC37M, along with its small brother, the MC18M.\nBoth are equally good models. One is for larger spaces, the other for smaller ones.\nStill, I prefer the MC37M by a large margin, because it is a lot stronger. And thus, you are a lot more flexible with it.\nYou can easily move it around and cool any regular-size room. With the smaller model, you are limited to smaller rooms.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-swamp-cooler/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;ve seen me talk a lot about the Hessaire MC37M.

The answer is no.\nQuick answer: No, swamp coolers do not need open windows to operate effectively. For optimal performance and energy efficiency, it\u0026rsquo;s better to keep windows closed and control the indoor humidity through regular venting.\nIn fact, your cooler performs best with your windows closed and occasional venting. This contrasts with several misconceptions about swamp coolers: that the increased humidity must be constantly vented out, that longer running times lead to higher humidity, and that open windows help airflow. In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll bust these myths and give you a clear guide to using your swamp cooler more efficiently.\nWhy do swamp coolers not need open windows?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve tackled some common misunderstandings about swamp coolers in this post.\nMyth #1: Swamp coolers create humidity and the humidity needs to leave the house as soon as possible Myth #2: the longer a swamp cooler runs, the more humid the air (false!) Myth #3: open windows help the swamp cooler’s airflow By understanding these points, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to make your swamp cooler work efficiently, keeping your home comfortably cool.\nMythbusting: Why swamp coolers don\u0026rsquo;t need open windows Let\u0026rsquo;s check each myth in depth:\nMyth #1: Swamp Coolers require constant venting Swamp coolers work by evaporating water into the air, thereby increasing its humidity. It\u0026rsquo;s a common assumption that this increased humidity is harmful and must be constantly vented out. However, this belief doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite hit the mark.\nThe fear of humidity comes from the idea that it could potentially damage a house\u0026rsquo;s structure. Yet, if humidity alone were enough to degrade a house, dwellings in humid climates, such as those in Florida or Central Europe, would be short-lived.\nAir humidity does not harm your house, but dew does The actual threat to houses is not humidity per se, but dew formation. Dew forms when humid air cools quickly, like during the night, causing the water vapor in the air to condense.\nThe condensed water, or dew, can then interact with certain materials, like wood, leading to potential water damage over time.\nWhen our dog spills water on the wooden floor, within a couple hours the floor soaks up the water and deforms and discolors permanently.\nDew (which usually forms on windows and in cold corners and drips down from there), can do the same harm.\nThis is why you have to periodically vent your house when using a swamp cooler. It’s not because of the humidity in your air, but to prevent dew formation when it gets cold outside!\nVent your room periodically instead Let\u0026rsquo;s take an example to illustrate this. Imagine you\u0026rsquo;ve been running your swamp cooler throughout a hot day. By evening, the humidity level in your house has increased due to the evaporative cooling process.\nAs the night approaches and temperatures drop, the chances of reaching the dew point inside your house rise.\nTo prevent this, you need to vent your house before the temperature starts to fall. This could be as simple as opening a window or door for a short time (10 minutes) to let out the humid air.\nOnce the humidity levels drop, you can close your windows and continue using the swamp cooler.\nWhile venting, you can continue running your swamp cooler. I recommend venting for 10 minutes every 3-4 hours.\nThe best way to track indoor humidity is to use a hygrometer, such as this one (click here to view it on amazon).\nI like to vent my room until the indoor humidity is within a range of 10% of the outdoor humidity.\nAny venting beyond that (to match outdoor humidity) gives you diminishing returns and will take a very long time.\nMyth #2: The longer a Swamp Cooler runs, the more humidity builds up Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the facts. Contrary to common belief, swamp coolers don\u0026rsquo;t magically pump unlimited moisture into your room, making it feel like a tropical rainforest.\nWhat happens, in reality, is based on a simple principle of evaporation. Your room\u0026rsquo;s temperature determines the total amount of water it can accommodate in vapor form.\nHumidity limit at room temperature Picture this. Your room\u0026rsquo;s temperature hovers around 72°F (22°C). Now, it has the capacity to hold up to about 19 grams of water per cubic meter.\nNo matter how long you keep your swamp cooler running, it can\u0026rsquo;t force more water vapor into the air than this limit.\nSo, in principle, you can run your swamp cooler 24/7.\nA fan can not evaporate water beyond the physical limit The fan in your swamp cooler, you ask? It\u0026rsquo;s not there to break any laws of physics and push in more water vapor.\nIts job is simply to speed up the cooling process by aiding the evaporation.\nThis helps the room reach its humidity limit faster, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t push it over the edge.\nOnce your room reaches this humidity ceiling (which depends on the temperature), your swamp cooler changes its role.\nIt transitions from being a humidity adder to simply an air mover. It\u0026rsquo;s akin to reaching a saturation point – beyond this, the swamp cooler doesn\u0026rsquo;t add extra humidity, it just circulates the air.\nMyth #3: Open windows increase airflow and Swamp Cooler efficiency The myth here goes something like this: keeping a window open will draw air through the swamp cooler, aiding the airflow, and ultimately making the cooling more effective.\nNote: This myth does not affect portable swamp coolers, since they stand in the middle of your room and are not exposed to the outside. With a portable swamp cooler this myth would make even less sense.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at this:\nRoof and window swamp coolers suck in outdoor air Swamp coolers, especially the ones mounted on windows or roofs, suck in hot air from the outside. Having an open window on the opposite side of the house might sound like a smart move to improve airflow, but that\u0026rsquo;s not always the case.\nYou can’t influence outdoor airflow direction One factor that many overlook is the unpredictable nature of airflow. When you leave a window open, there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee that the airflow will move in the direction you\u0026rsquo;d like. The airflow, governed by weather factors like wind direction, temperature gradients, and even the design of your home, can act in surprising ways.\nThe following scenario can happen:\nOutside air can enter through the window, pass through your swamp cooler, and escape out. In this case, you cool the outside while your indoor temperature rises!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the exact opposite of what you\u0026rsquo;d want.\nAirflow through window affects swamp cooler fan efficiency Another factor to consider is the effect of outdoor airflow on the swamp cooler\u0026rsquo;s fan. If the wind direction outside happens to be opposite to the fan\u0026rsquo;s blowing direction, it can hamper the fan\u0026rsquo;s ability to circulate air inside the room, making your swamp cooler less efficient.\nTo wrap it up, the idea that open windows can boost your swamp cooler\u0026rsquo;s efficiency doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s better to stick to regular venting and avoid any unnecessary rise in indoor temperature that might result from an open window.\nAfter all, the ultimate goal is to enjoy a cool, comfortable indoor environment, not to air-condition the outdoors.\nConclusion Wrapping up, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to keep your windows open for your swamp cooler to do its job.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s all about managing the indoor humidity smartly and not about inviting in the outside air all the time.\nVent your rooms every once in a while and use fans or open doors inside your house for better air circulation.\nYou control your cooler, not the other way around. So, enjoy a chilled summer without fussing over open windows.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/do-swamp-coolers-need-open-windows/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eEver wondered if you need to leave your windows open for your swamp cooler to work effectively?

Hardly.\nIt definitely skyrockets your swamp cooler running costs.\nQuick answer: Putting ice in a swamp cooler doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense. The addition of ice doesn\u0026rsquo;t significantly enhance cooling, it increases energy consumption and cost, and ice melts rapidly in the cooler\u0026rsquo;s environment. Moreover, the design of many swamp coolers prevents the inclusion of ice in the tank.\nHow does a swamp cooler work? Does it need ice? A swamp cooler cools down air by evaporating water. Water evaporation sucks heat energy away from the air.\nA water pump takes the water from the cooler\u0026rsquo;s tank and distributes it onto a cooling pad.\nA fan then propels air through this water-saturated pad. As the water evaporates, it absorbs heat from the air, effectively cooling it down.\nNow, this whole process operates under a particular premise: the pump is designed to transport liquid water, not solid ice.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re considering adding ice, it must be in a water-ice mix form\nThis ensures that the pump can effectively transport the mixture onto the cooling pad.\nCan ice in the tank affect water evaporation? The thought of adding ice to a swamp cooler may seem sensible at first glance.\nIce is colder than water, so it should increase the cooling power, right?\nUnfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s not that straightforward.\nRemember, the cooling effect is primarily generated at the water pads where the evaporation occurs.\nThese pads, by design, always remain above the melting temperature of ice because their purpose is to facilitate the evaporation of liquid water.\nConsequently, even if ice is present in the tank, the water pads\u0026rsquo; temperature is unlikely to decrease significantly.\nThis suggests that the presence of ice might not yield a noticeable increase in the cooler\u0026rsquo;s performance.\nDoes ice in a swamp cooler increase running costs? Understanding the financial implication of freezing water into ice is critical to determine if it\u0026rsquo;s cost-effective to add ice to your swamp cooler.\nHow much does freezing water to ice cost? The process of freezing this water requires two main steps. First, the water needs to be cooled from room temperature (about 20°C) to 0°C (freezing point).\nThe energy required for this can be calculated using the formula Q = mcΔT, which gives us approximately 83,720 joules to freeze one kg of water.\nFor anyone interested: The formula Q = mcΔT is used to calculate the amount of heat energy (Q) required to change the temperature (ΔT) of a given mass (m) of a substance with a specific heat capacity (c). The heat capacity of water is 4.186 J/g°C.\nNext, to convert the cooled water to ice, we need an additional 334,000 joules.\nTo get this number you can use the formula Q = mL, where \u0026lsquo;L\u0026rsquo; is the latent heat of fusion for water (334 J/g).\nSo, to freeze a kilogram of water, you need\nEnergy = Heat extraction energy + Heat fusion energy = 83,720 joules + 334,000 joules = 417,720 joules\n1 US gallon is 3.785 liters of water, so:\nIn total, to freeze 1 gallon of water your freezer would need to do about 1.581 Megajoules of work.\n( 1 Megajoule = 1,000,000 Joules = 1,000,000 Ws (Watt-seconds) = 277.77 Wh (Watt-hours) ≈ 0.278 kWh (Kilowatt-hours) )\nIn total, your freezer would need to do about 7.9 million joules (or 7.9 megajoules) of work to freeze 5 gallons of water from room temperature down to the freezing point.\nThat would be half a swamp cooler tank\u0026rsquo;s worth of ice.\nWith an average electricity cost of 23 cents per kilowatt-hour in the US currently, and considering that one kilowatt-hour equals 3.6 megajoules, it costs approximately 50.4 cents to freeze 5 gallons of water.\nDoes filling ice in a swamp cooler increase overall running costs? Yes, adding ice to your swamp cooler not only incurs the cost of freezing water but also impacts the overall energy efficiency of the cooler.\nA 10-gallon swamp cooler tank lasts you 4 hours. During these 4 hours, a regular 250W swamp cooler uses 1 kWh of energy, and this consumption doesn\u0026rsquo;t change when ice is added.\nHowever, the energy expended to freeze the water into ice significantly increases the overall energy usage.\nI calculated how much electricity a swamp cooler consumes when you run it for 4 hours.\nHere’s the result in a table:\nIce added to a 10-gallon tank****Total energy expenditure (including ice freezing and swamp cooler power consumption)****Total cost per swamp cooler-hour0 gal.1 kWh$0.231 gal.1.28 kWh$0.292 gal.1.56 kWh$0.363 gal.1.83 kWh$0.424 gal.2.11 kWh$0.495 gal.2.39 kWh$0.556 gal.2.67 kWh$0.617 gal.2.95 kWh$0.688 gal.3.22 kWh$0.749 gal.3.50 kWh$0.8110 gal.3.78 kWh$0.87\nAs you can see, the total energy and your total electricity cost increases the more ice you add.\nFor instance, with 5 gallons of ice, the total energy requirement becomes 2.39 kWh, and the running cost is now 55 cents, compared to 23 cents without ice. With 10 gallons of ice, it\u0026rsquo;s 3.78 kWh, and the running cost is 87 cents.\nAnd please note: This calculation is assumes physically ideal circumstances. The energy cost does not factor in inefficiencies by your fridge, which might only be 50% or 80% energy efficient.\nSo, in practice, the cost is even higher than that!\nAs you can see, total energy consumption rises the more water you freeze for your swamp cooler.\nCan you even put ice in a Swamp Cooler? Interestingly, the question of adding ice to a swamp cooler isn\u0026rsquo;t merely about physics and finances.\nThe design of many swamp coolers presents a practical barrier to this idea. Several models come with a grid covering the tank opening, which prevents large objects, including ice, from being filled in the tank.\nI am not sure if the manufacturers really created the grid in order to prevent you from filling ice in the tank. It might as well be to prevent other large stuff from entering the tank.\nHence, even if you want to add ice, the design of your cooler might not allow it.\nDoes an ice-filled Swamp Cooler or Portable Air Conditioner cost more to run? When considering cooling options for your space, the comparison between a swamp cooler and a portable air conditioner often comes up.\nMy favorite portable AC is the Whynter ARC-14S since it is a dual-hose system and very efficient.\nLet’s do a case study.\nUnlike a swamp cooler, a portable AC works efficiently regardless of the climate. And just like a portable swamp cooler, you can easily move it to cool different rooms.\nBut how does it fare in terms of energy consumption compared to an ice-filled swamp cooler?\nThe Whynter ARC-14S has a cooling power of 14,000 BTU (British Thermal Units), and its Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) is 11.2. This means that for every watt of power it consumes, it produces 11.2 BTUs of cooling. Given that 1 BTU is equivalent to 0.2931 watts, the Whynter ARC-14S consumes around 1.29 kilowatts of electricity.\nComparing this with our previous calculations for an ice-filled swamp cooler, we find that a 10-gallon cooler with 10 gallons of ice uses around 3.78 kWh over 4 hours or approximately 0.945 kWh per hour.\nThis suggests that even under the most extreme condition (the swamp cooler is completely filled with ice), the ice-filled swamp cooler still consumes less energy than the Whynter ARC-14S air conditioner.\nSo, surprisingly: If you feel like the ice in your swamp cooler helps you cool your room down, freezing water and putting it in a swamp cooler is still cheaper than running a portable AC.\nDoes an ice-filled swamp cooler or a portable air conditioner make more sense? Despite the higher energy consumption, a portable air conditioner like the Whynter ARC-14S could still be a more sensible choice for some situations.\nThe effectiveness of a swamp cooler is heavily dependent on the climate. In humid conditions, their cooling power drastically decreases. On the other hand, an air conditioner performs consistently, regardless of the outside weather.\nA portable AC is likely able to keep your room temperature consistently low whenever you want.\nA swamp cooler filled with ice needs constant ice refills. Are you even able to produce that much ice around the clock?\nIf freezing water and refilling the water tank costs you 30 minutes of your time every day, and you assume an average wage of $15, that’s $7.5 worth of your time. So:\nIf you factor in physical effort, a portable air conditioner is way cheaper than an ice-filled swamp cooler.\nAdditionally, the process of freezing water to add to the swamp cooler, along with the quickly diminishing effects of the ice, introduces inefficiencies that aren\u0026rsquo;t present with a portable air conditioner.\nWhile the upfront cost and energy consumption of a portable air conditioner might be higher, its efficiency, convenience, and versatility often outweigh these costs, particularly in warmer, more humid climates.\nRemember, the best choice depends on your specific needs, budget, and environmental conditions. Consider all these factors before making your decision.\nConclusion Given the underlying physics, increased costs, and potential design limitations, adding ice to a swamp cooler does not make sense.\nIt neither significantly enhances the cooling effect nor proves cost-effective.\nTo ensure effective cooling, focus more on regular maintenance of your swamp cooler. Changing the water regularly, cleaning the pads, and ensuring a constant supply of fresh air can all contribute to efficient operation.\nIf cooling is still insufficient, consider upgrading to a model with a higher cooling capacity or exploring alternative cooling systems like air conditioners. They might offer more cooling potential, though they are more energy-intensive.\nUnderstanding the workings of your cooling system can help you make smart and informed decisions. Remember, effective cooling isn\u0026rsquo;t just about making things colder; it\u0026rsquo;s also about efficient and smart use of resources.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/does-ice-in-a-swamp-cooler-make-sense/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDoes putting ice in a swamp cooler make sense?

In this article, we’re checking how a swamp cooler uses water to cool and what happens once it runs dry.\nContrary to popular belief you can run a swamp cooler without water! And in extreme situations, you can even refill a swamp cooler without access to water.\nLet’s find out how!\nQuick answer: Yes, you can run a swamp cooler without water. Once the water runs out, it becomes a simple fan. So, you still have a (reduced) cooling effect. In an emergency, where you don’t have access to water, you can collect morning dew by placing the water pads outdoors overnight. The humidity is enough to cool you in the afternoon heat.\nBlogger’s bollox I found online One more note from my side: I’ve just seen an article online claiming you can’t run a swamp cooler without water since the water acts as lubrication, and without that “lubrication” swamp coolers wear down.\nThat is totally wrong!\nReading these claims and seeing them ranked as the “best” result on Google gives me a headache.\nWater does not lubricate a swamp cooler.\nThe wet water pads and the fan motor are completely separate components. They don’t touch!\nThe fan’s bearings are lubricated with oil. The water in a swamp cooler has nothing to do with lubrication.\nIf you lubricate anything with water, it actually wears down faster because of rust and limestone buildup.\nWhy do swamp coolers need water? A swamp cooler is a fan that blows warm air from your room through wet sponges. The warm air causes the water to evaporate.\nAnd this evaporation sucks away the heat energy from the air.\nIt’s as if you pour water into a hot pan. The water boils and evaporates. Meanwhile, the pan cools down.\nThat’s the concept swamp coolers are based on.\nSo, to work properly, the sponges have to be wet.\nHow to refill swamp cooler water There are two main ways to refill swamp cooler water, depending on the type of unit you have:\nWater Tank Most swamp coolers have a built-in water tank. A water pump then draws water from that tank and soaks the sponges.\nOn average, a water tank lasts for 3-4 hours. Some swamp coolers can run on a water tank for 5-6 hours, but usually, these are just weaker models with less cooling power.\nContinuous Refill You can connect most (good) swamp coolers to a water source, such as a tap. Usually, the connection point is compatible with a garden hose.\nOnce connected, you can run your swamp cooler off the tap indefinitely and it will never run out of water.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what a typical swamp cooler water tap setup looks like!\nCan you run a swamp cooler without water? But what happens when you don’t have a water source?\nAs we just saw, you can always fill the water tank. A quality swamp cooler’s tank size is usually around 10 gallons. But, of course, sizes vary depending on the model.\n10 gallons is quite a number. So, manual refills always become annoying after some time.\nWhen you don’t have access to any water, you can run your swamp cooler without water.\nSwamp coolers don’t overheat if you run them without water.\nJust like regular fans, they are low-power devices and can run perfectly well without any water.\nWhen you intentionally run your swamp cooler without water, disconnect the water pump’s power supply. Dry-running the pump wears it down quickly.\nSome swamp coolers have a floater that detects water levels. When the water runs out, they will automatically shut down the swamp cooler.\nOf course, the cooling effect is lower when you run your swamp cooler without water. It is comparable to the cooling effect of a regular fan.\nWithout water, a swamp cooler has nothing to evaporate. Therefore, it is simply a fan that blows air through dry pads.\nActually, to run your swamp cooler without water, remove the water pads from your swamp cooler for ideal airflow and lower noise.\nWater pads only make sense when they are wet. Once they are dry, they are an unnecessary air resistance.\nAlso, since your swamp cooler doesn’t have to force air through the pads anymore, it runs quieter.\nAlternative Method: Using Dew-Covered Water Pads While running a swamp cooler without water won\u0026rsquo;t offer substantial cooling, there is an alternative method that some people use to make the most of dew accumulation.\nBy placing water pads outdoors overnight, they can accumulate dew.\nIn the afternoon, when the air is hot and dry, you can use the dew-covered water pads in the swamp cooler.\nOf course, the dew won’t last you nearly as long as a full water tank.\nAlso, there’s another problem: Morning dew levels differ by US regions.\nIronically, in the dry and hot regions, where swamp coolers make the most sense, the average morning dew collected is the lowest.\n**Region****Average dew collected (in millimeters)**New York City2.5Los Angeles0.2Chicago3.0Houston4.8Miami5.5Denver1.0Phoenix0.1Seattle2.2Atlanta3.3Las Vegas0.3\nStill, morning dew collection might be worth it in an emergency even in the more humid regions.\nBecause, during the afternoon, air humidity decreases heavily. And then, swamp coolers work almost everywhere.\nCoolers that don\u0026rsquo;t need water Of course, there are cooling devices that don’t need water:\nAir conditioners Air conditioners, whether central AC units or portable air conditioners, don\u0026rsquo;t require water for their cooling process.\nHere’s a list of my favorite portable air conditioners.\nThey operate by using refrigerants and compressors to remove heat from the air, providing effective cooling indoors.\nFans Fans also work without water.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that fans do not reduce the temperature of the air.\nInstead, they create a cooling sensation by blowing air over your skin, which carries away the heat from your body.\nI always recommend floor fans, because they are very strong, run on low power, and are indestructible.\nIn principle, every swamp cooler is a floor fan covered in wet sponges.\nConclusion Swamp coolers can run without water. Of course, running them with water makes a lot more sense.\nThe water evaporation is precisely what distinguishes a swamp cooler from other coolers such as air conditioners or fans.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-run-a-swamp-cooler-without-water/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDo you need to refill a swamp cooler or can you run it without water?

What’s the better choice for you?\nIn this article, I am comparing swamp coolers and air conditioners\nThe focus here is to provide you with an objective comparison. For every comparison, I am providing numbers and indisputable facts.\nAfter reading through all the sections, you will know whether a swamp cooler or an air conditioner suits you better.\nQuick answer: Swamp coolers are way cheaper to run and do not require any installation. Air conditioners, however, work anywhere and anytime. Swamp coolers work best in dry and hot climates.\nLet’s check the comparison in more detail:\nSwamp cooler and air conditioner comparison (in numbers, not an opinion!) 1. Running Cost The running cost of a cooling system is a crucial factor for most users, as it directly impacts their monthly expenses. The primary component contributing to running costs is electricity consumption.\nSwamp Cooler: Swamp coolers are known for their energy efficiency. They utilize a simple mechanism that evaporates water to cool the air, consuming much less electricity compared to air conditioners.\nOn average, a swamp cooler with 1,500 - 3,500 CFM (cubic feet per minute) airflow consumes around 150W to 350W.\nI’d say a regular, quality portable swamp cooler consumes about 250W of power. Larger roof swamp coolers can, of course, consume more.\nAssuming an electricity rate of $0.18 per kWh and 8 hours of daily usage during the cooling season, the monthly running cost would be approximately $6.48 for a 150W swamp cooler and up to $15.12 for a 350W cooler.\nAir Conditioner Air conditioners, especially the traditional compressor-based units, consume more electricity due to their complex refrigeration process. A 12,000 BTU (British Thermal Unit) air conditioner typically runs on 1,200 - 1,500W.\nSmaller (portable) air conditioners, run on less power. I have a 6,000 BTU portable AC. It consumes roughly 600W.\nUsing the same electricity rate and daily usage, the monthly running cost for an air conditioner can be estimated to be around $51.84 to $64.80 (for 1,200W to 1,500W models).\nFor small portable air conditioners, the running cost is about $25.92.\n**Type****Monthly running cost (8h per day usage)**Swamp cooler (350W)$15.12Air conditioner (1,200W)$51.84\nAs you can see, swamp coolers are a lot cheaper to run than air conditioners.\nThe average monthly savings from running a swamp cooler instead of an air conditioner are $36.72.\nRunning a swamp cooler will pay for itself within a couple of months or years (depending on whether you replace a large air conditioning system with it, or just a small portable air conditioner).\n2. Where and when does it work? Swamp Cooler Swamp coolers work best in dry climates with low humidity. They are highly effective in regions like the West Coast, where the air is arid and the temperatures are hot.\nThat’s because dry air can evaporate more water than humid air. And evaporation absorbs heat energy. So, the drier your location, the better.\nSwamp coolers are most efficient during the afternoon and evening when humidity levels are at their lowest.\nContrary to popular belief, swamp coolers work in almost every US state during the dry afternoon and evening hours.\nHumidity levels can vary up to 60% over the course of a day. In most states, in the morning, swamp coolers won’t work. But in the afternoon they usually work.\nSo, in principle, you can run a swamp cooler almost anywhere. However, if you are in one of the more humid states, a swamp cooler only makes sense during summer in the afternoon heat.\nAir Conditioner Air conditioners work regardless of humidity levels. That’s why they are used everywhere. They work in humid states such as Florida and in dry states such as Arizona.\nActually, air conditioners remove humidity from your living space. So, humidity-wise, air conditioners do the exact opposite of swamp coolers.\nAir conditioners work anywhere and anytime. Swamp coolers work only when the air is dry. That is usually the case in western US states and in the afternoon and evening hours.\n3. Maintainability Swamp Cooler Swamp coolers are relatively easy to maintain since they have fewer mechanical parts compared to air conditioners. Regular maintenance involves cleaning and replacing the cooling pads, as well as ensuring proper water circulation.\nParts that can break in a swamp cooler are:\nthe fan the water pump Both the fan and the water pump are low-power electric parts. Individually, the fan and the water pump usually run on ~100W at most.\nSwamp cooler parts last up to 50,000 hours of usage. So, you can use a swamp cooler all day.\nA swamp cooler doesn’t break easily. I\u0026rsquo;ve found a single example of a broken fan in a swamp cooler. I guess, something got in the inside.\nAir Conditioner:\nAir conditioners have more complex systems, including compressors, condensers, and refrigerants, which require regular maintenance.\nOftentimes, it is recommended to schedule annual servicing to clean the filters, check for refrigerant leaks, and ensure optimal performance.\nOf course, it’s also possible to learn about air conditioner parts yourself and maintain things on your own. I have a lot of air conditioner fixing guides on this website. Check them out!\nThe maintenance cost for air conditioners can be higher than that of swamp coolers.\nParts that can break in an air conditioner are:\nthe compressor pipes (that leak refrigerant) the fan But to be honest, an air conditioner compressor doesn’t just break. An average air conditioner with regular maintenance can easily last 20+ years.\nAir conditioner parts, such as the compressor, are highly optimized from decades of research and engineering.\nBoth swamp coolers and air conditioners need maintenance. Swamp coolers have fewer parts, so there is less to break. And air conditioners have solid and better-engineered parts that last a long time.\n4. Initial Cost Swamp Cooler Swamp coolers are generally more affordable to purchase and install compared to air conditioners. A standard residential swamp cooler can cost anywhere between $500 to $1,500, depending on the model and capacity.\nPortable swamp coolers, are, of course, cheaper than roof-mounted coolers.\nMy all-time favorite swamp cooler is the Hessaire MC37M (click here to view it on amazon). Currently, it’s around $360.\nAir Conditioner Air conditioners typically have a higher initial cost. A central air conditioning system can cost anywhere from $2,500 to $5,000 or more, depending on the size of the property and the energy efficiency rating.\nPortable air conditioners are, of course, less expensive. And you can get a very good model for comparably little money.\nThe objectively best (and most powerful) portable air conditioner is the Whynter ARC-14S (click to view it on amazon).\nIt is one of the very few portable air conditioners with a dual-hose system. So, it is as efficient as a big air conditioning system.\nCurrently, it costs around $375.\nLarge swamp coolers cost around $1,500 and are significantly more cheaper than central air conditioning, which easily costs $5,000.\nHowever, portable swamp coolers and portable air conditioners cost about the same.\nRemember that the running cost of an air conditioner is still higher than that of a swamp cooler.\n5. Noise Technically, noise is just the vibration of air molecules. Both air conditioners and swamp coolers have to move cold air around.\nFor that, they need a fan.\nSo, noise is inevitable.\nIf anyone ever tries to sell you a fully quiet air conditioner or swamp cooler, they are lying.\nSwamp Cooler and Air Conditioner Both swamp coolers and air conditioners produce some noise during operation, but modern units are designed to minimize it.\nThe quietest portable air conditioners are around 52dB, which is about the level of library noise.\nThe noise level can vary depending on the specific model and capacity.\nUsually, strong devices with high airflow are louder than weaker models.\nThe best way to control noise levels is to reduce airflow. And for air conditioners, also increase the temperature settings.\nThe less your air conditioner has to cool, the less it will run the noisy compressor.\nAn air conditioner technically produces more noise than a swamp cooler, since, in addition to the fan, it has to run the noisy compressor. A swamp cooler needs just a fan.\n6. Installation Air Conditioner Residential air conditioners, which are commonly used to cool entire homes, typically require a significant amount of installation effort. This process involves placing the indoor evaporator unit and the outdoor condenser unit.\nAdditionally, ductwork needs to be installed throughout the house to distribute the cool air.\nPortable air conditioners are simpler to install. Usually, their installation does not need tools.\nAnd certainly, you don’t need to hire a professional.\nYou have to install portable ACs to a window so that the heat the device extracts from your room can vent outside.\nTo attach it to the window, you need a window installation kit, which is always included with the portable AC.\nIn some cases, if a window option is not available, you can also install your portable air conditioners through a drilled hole in an external wall for venting.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how a full installation looks like:\nSwamp Cooler The installation of swamp coolers differs from that of air conditioners. Residential swamp coolers, also known as evaporative coolers, require placement on the roof of the building. The roof placement allows the cooler to draw in outside air, which passes through water pads.\nOf course, the roof installation requires significant installation. So, in general, I recommend getting a portable swamp cooler.\nPortable swamp coolers don’t require any installation. You can connect them to a water tap for continuous water refills.\nBut that’s optional.\nIn general, swamp coolers are simpler to install than air conditioners. Portable swamp coolers are simpler to install than portable air conditioners. And residential swamp coolers are simpler to install than residential air conditioners.\n7. Size Actually, the size of a residential air conditioner is hard to measure, since it includes ductwork and it is a split system, consisting of indoor and outdoor parts.\nMeanwhile, the size of a residential swamp cooler is very limited. It’s a large box on your roof or next to your house.\nPortable swamp coolers and portable air conditioners are similar in size.\n8. Portability Both swamp coolers and air conditioners have portable variants.\nSwamp coolers Portable air conditioners are 100% portable, since they don’t require any installation.\nAir conditioners Portable air conditioners are only partly portable. Yes, you can move them around the house.\nBut for each window you use it with, you need a window installation kit.\nUsually, however, you don’t need to move your portable air conditioner around.\nThe point of portability is not moving the thing around. Rather, I’d say, it is being able to install it during summer and removing it for the cold seasons.\nStill, swamp coolers are undisputably more portable.\nWhen to choose a swamp cooler over an air conditioner?\nBased on the above comparison, a swamp cooler is an ideal choice if:\nYou live in a dry and hot climate, such as the West Coast You are looking for a more energy-efficient and cost-effective cooling solution You prefer a cooling system with simpler maintenance You have a limited budget and want a more affordable initial cost You are open to DIY installation and want a portable cooling option Conclusion In conclusion, the decision between a swamp cooler and an air conditioner depends on your specific needs, budget, and location.\nIf you live in a dry climate and prioritize energy efficiency and affordability, a swamp cooler is the better choice for you.\nHowever, if you seek a cooling system that can function effectively in various climates and provides year-round comfort, an air conditioner is better.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/swamp-cooler-vs-air-conditioner-comparison/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSwamp cooler vs air conditioner.

Swamp coolers are the ultimate breeding ground for bacteria and bad odors.\nAll the dust that comes in from the outside collects on the air filters and the wet water pads.\nAfter a few days in the summer heat, the smell is inevitable.\nSwamp coolers stink naturally. Especially, when they’re used a lot.\nSo, let’s have a look at how you can get rid of the smell by cleaning your swamp cooler.\nQuick answer: You can fix swamp cooler smell by cleaning or replacing the water pads. Also, clean the water tank with a vinegar and water solution. Dust the air filters. And, if needed, soak the water hose in a bucket full of water and add half a cup of vinegar or bleach.\nHow to remove the smell from your swamp cooler To clean your swamp cooler, you will need at least\naccess to water a sponge Ideally, you also grab a vacuum cleaner. If you want to brute-force rinse your entire swamp cleaner, a garden hose is helpful as well, but it’s optional.\n1. Clean the water pads Most of the smell in a swamp cooler comes from the water pads. So, the first, and by far most important step is to clean the pads.\nOpen the backside of your swamp cooler. You might need a screwdriver.\nOnce the back side of your swamp cooler is open, you should be able to take out the water pads easily.\nSometimes, the water pads barely fit inside the swamp cooler and are stuck. So, you need to pull them out with force.\nWater pads are never fixed to the swamp cooler, so don’t worry about breaking off anything.\nRinse the water pads using a garden hose Once the water pads are out, the simplest way to clean the water pads is to rinse them with your garden hose.\nYou will see a lot of dirt coming out of the water pads.\nSoak the water pads in the tub Alternatively, you can soak the swamp cooler’s pads in your bathtub. If you want, you can add vinegar or soap to dissolve more stuff and kill off bacteria.\nLet the sponge pads soak for an hour.\nAfter that, rinse the water pads thoroughly.\nOptional: Dry the pads If you actively use your swamp cooler, there is no need to dry the water pads.\nThe swamp cooler will soak the pads anyways.\nBut if you want to store away your swamp cooler for the colder season, you should dry your water pads thoroughly before putting them in the cooler again.\nDry them in the sun. Alternatively, use a drier or heated floor to dry the pads.\nInsert the water pads Insert the water pads only after the cleaning of the entire swamp cooler is done.\nSo, wait for reinsertion, until the end.\nTo insert the water pads, just force them back into place. During rinsing or soaking, water pads can change shape and size a bit. So, they might not fit well initially.\nBut over time, they will readapt to their original size.\nAlternatively: Replace the pads Instead of cleaning the water pads, you can also just replace them entirely.\nA full replacement is, of course, better than cleaning. New sponge pads don’t hold any leftover bacteria. And they will last you much longer before they start smelling.\nThe hard part is just finding fitting parts for swamp coolers.\nOnline, I found one person complaining:\n“You say replace the pads like it’s easy to find the correct pad for your cooler model”\nBut actually, you don’t need to find fitting replacement pads. You can just cut them to size.\nI recommend getting this evaporator water pad 2-pack (click here to view them on amazon).\nThese pads suit almost any swamp cooler. And if you have a smaller model, just cut off bits until they fit.\nReplacing the pads obviously costs some money. But if you compare that to hiring an HVAC technician, who usually charges beyond $80, you still save a lot of money!\n2. Clean the air filters Some swamp coolers have built-in air filters. You should be able to access the air filter once the back side of the swamp cooler is open.\nUsually, the air filters don’t need replacement, since they do not get wet themselves and, therefore, don’t cause the smell directly.\nThere are two ways to clean the air filter:\nDry clean air filters using a brush To clean dusty air filters, I always recommend cleaning them using a dry brush. You can use an old toothbrush or something similar.\nSometimes it is even possible to pull off the dust using your bare hands.\nI always recommend dry-brush cleaning, because it does not increase bacteria growth.\nAir filters collect bacteria, dust, and dirt. They filter things you don’t want inside your swamp cooler.\nAs long as the air filter in your swamp cooler is dry, bacteria and dust will just accumulate, but they won’t grow.\nAs soon as you add water, life explodes. New bacteria grow and worsen the smell of your swamp cooler.\nThe worst mistake you can do is to rinse an air filter with water and replace it without drying.\nThat happened to me once and I had to dispose of the air filter afterwards. Even though it looked clean, it smelled so badly that it was impossible to use.\nSo, just dry off any visible dust using a dry brush!\nRinse air filters with water Only ever rinse your air filters with water if you can put them outside in direct sunshine until they are fully dry.\nI still recommend dry-brushing over rinsing air filters …\nClean the water tank\nThe next step is to clean the water tank. The water tank can collect algae and bacteria over time.\nYou can tell if the water tank visibly discolors. I’ve seen water tanks that had a slimy green coating on the inside.\nBefore you clean the water tank, you first have to drain it. To do that, either place a drain pan below your swamp cooler or move the entire swamp cooler outdoors.\nThen, open the drain hose.\nAfter that, close the drain again and fill the tank with half water, and half distilled vinegar (as strong as possible).\nLet that sit for an hour.\nAfterward, drain again. Ideally, scrub the inside walls of the water tank. If you can’t reach the inside, you can use a pipe cleaner brush like this one (click to view it on amazon).\nThen, refill the tank with fresh water.\n3. Clean the water hose If you use your swamp cooler with a water hose (for continuous refills), some of the smell inside it can come from the bacteria and algae from the water hose.\nSo, if you want to clean everything perfectly, you should clean the water hose as well.\nThe water hose, is, however, rarely the problem.\nSo, I recommend you only clean the water hose if you already cleaned everything else and your swamp cooler still smells after a couple of days of usage.\nTo clean a water hose:\nPut the hose in a big bucket of water. Pour in a cup of vinegar or half a cup of bleach.\nLet the hose sit in the solution for 24 hours.\nAfter that, rinse the hose with water. And, of course, run water through the hose to get the vinegar or bleach solution and all the dissolved dirt out.\n4. Clean the exterior When cleaning your swamp cooler, don’t forget about the exterior. Especially the fins covering the water pads can hold a lot of dust.\nYou can wipe the entire swamp cooler’s surface with a wet cleaning cloth. Or you can just dust off the debris from the swamp cooler’s surface.\nI like to use a vacuum for that. Of course, the standard carpet attachment doesn’t work well for that. I like to use an attachment intended for narrow spaces such as couch slits or cars.\nOnce that’s done, your swamp cooler is ready to run again! The smell is gone now.\nHow to avoid swamp cooler smell in the future The smell in swamp coolers always comes from bacteria, which, in turn, come from the dust accumulating in and around the swamp cooler.\nSo, to avoid the smell, you have to minimize the dust exposure of your swamp cooler.\nThere are two approaches to minimizing dust exposure. And you should take both of them:\n1. Regularly remove dust from your swamp cooler The first approach is to regularly clean your swamp cooler. If you regularly clean your swamp cooler, it is impossible for bacteria colonies to grow quickly.\nBacteria grows exponentially. That means the size of a bacteria colony doubles every couple of hours or days (depending on the species).\nIf your entire swamp cooler houses a colony of 100 bacteria cells, and the colony size doubles after a day, that’s 200 bacteria cells afterward. So, in a day, your swamp cooler accumulates 100 new bacteria.\nHowever, if your swamp cooler houses 1,000,000 (a million) bacteria, within a day the growth rate will be another million cells. That’s where you truly notice exponential growth.\nYour job is to regularly rinse the water pads and dust your swamp cooler to reduce the bacteria colony inside to sizes with small daily growth rates.\nAnd the frequency of your cleaning derives from the growth rate of bacteria, e.g. rinse the pads every week or two.\n2. Don’t even allow dust to enter your swamp cooler Additionally, when you don’t use your swamp cooler, don’t keep it open for dust and dirt to enter.\nSometimes, even insects such as wasps will enter swamp coolers, carry debris inside and build a nest.\nDust, dirt, and insects are not welcome.\nYou can keep them out using this Hessaire swamp cooler cover (click here to view it on amazon).\nThat’s a simple cover you can put on your swamp cooler whenever you don’t use it.\nIt keeps dirt, dust, and insects out. And if you use your swamp cooler outdoors, it prevents the swamp cooler discovering from the sun’s UV rays.\nConclusion You can clean your swamp cooler by rinsing the water pads regularly. To clean the water tank, fill it with distilled vinegar and water. Let it sit and then use a pipe brush to clean out all the dirt.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-swamp-cooler-smell/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow to fix swamp cooler smell.

In this article, we’re having a quick glance at all US states and whether swamp coolers work there or not.\nQuick answer: Swamp coolers work in almost every US state during the afternoon, because that is the driest time of the day. Using a swamp cooler all day and throughout the year only makes sense in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.\nDoes a swamp cooler work in your state? I spent some time figuring out in which states swamp coolers make sense according to average humidity values.\nIf you stick out until the end of this article, you will see why these average humidities are useless to determine swamp cooler effectiveness.\nBut let’s have a look at the data first. Don’t take the “Does a swamp cooler work in this state”-column too seriously for now.\n**StateAverage relative humidityDoes a swamp cooler work in this state?**Alabama68%noAlaska71%noArizona39%yesArkansas67%noCalifornia69%noColorado48%yesConnecticut66%noDelaware67%noFlorida72%noGeorgia68%noHawaii64%noIdaho55%yesIllinois71%noIndiana71%noIowa67%noKansas65%noKentucky67%noLouisiana74%noMaine72%noMaryland65%noMassachusetts67%noMichigan73%noMinnesota67%noMississippi73%noMissouri68%noMontana58%yesNebraska68%noNevada52%yesNew Hampshire69%noNew Jersey71%noNew Mexico45%yesNew York72%noNorth Carolina68%noNorth Dakota66%noOhio69%noOklahoma64%noOregon72%noPennsylvania66%noRhode Island68%noSouth Carolina68%noSouth Dakota68%noTennessee69%noTexas66%noUtah55%yesVermont68%noVirginia68%noWashington73%noWest Virginia71%noWisconsin71%noWyoming53%yes\nThe humidity data in the table is based on this source.\nWhy you can’t trust the data The table contains average humidity climate data. If the average humidity in a given state is smaller than 60%, it states that a swamp cooler works, else it doesn’t.\nHowever, you can’t fully trust the table with its climate averages when it comes to using swamp coolers.\nUsually, you need a swamp cooler when it is exceptionally hot . So, by definition, average data is not useful.\nFor example, the average humidity in California is 69% and comparably high. Which is why the table above states that a swamp cooler is ineffective there.\nHowever, the table above includes the average humidity levels over an entire year, including summer and winter, which have vastly different climates. Also, it does not differentiate between morning and afternoon humidity.\nMorning and afternoon swamp cooler usage Mornings tend to be humid (you can tell because of the morning dew), while afternoons and evenings are comparably dry.\nLet’s have another look at all US states, but this time let’s check if a swamp cooler works there in the afternoon.\nState****Average relative humidity **in the afternoon****Does a swamp cooler work?**Alabama52%yesAlaska64%noArizona25%yesArkansas49%yesCalifornia62%noColorado35%yesConnecticut52%yesDelaware54%yesFlorida57%yesGeorgia50%yesHawaii56%yesIdaho41%yesIllinois58%yesIndiana58%yesIowa56%yesKansas50%yesKentucky55%yesLouisiana61%noMaine61%noMaryland52%yesMassachusetts59%yesMichigan61%noMinnesota55%yesMississippi54%yesMissouri53%yesMontana45%yesNebraska53%yesNevada32%yesNew Hampshire53%yesNew Jersey59%yesNew Mexico29%yesNew York61%noNorth Carolina52%yesNorth Dakota51%yesOhio57%yesOklahoma48%yesOregon59%yesPennsylvania54%yesRhode Island57%yesSouth Carolina49%yesSouth Dakota53%yesTennessee53%yesTexas49%yesUtah43%yesVermont58%yesVirginia52%yesWashington62%noWest Virginia59%yesWisconsin58%yesWyoming43%yes\nAs you can see in this afternoon-humidity table, a swamp cooler works in almost any US state in the afternoon and early evening heat.\nSo, getting a swamp cooler for the very hot and dry summer days is worth it almost anywhere.\nA typical 24-hour humidity chart looks like this:\nAs you can see in the sample data above, the humidity reaches almost 80% humidity during the night time. However, during day time, humidity sinks below 20%.\nOf course, this is an extreme example. Here, the humidity varies by \u0026gt;60%! Some places never reach humidities below 30%.\nBut a variation of 40-50% is definitely possible in most places.\nAnd that’s what everybody forgets about. Everybody claims that getting a swamp cooler is not worth it in the more humid states.\nYes, that’s true if you assume that the actual weather sticks to the average values. But that’s not how weather works.\nWe have sunshine and rain, hot and cold. And it always alternates. Using averages makes no sense when it comes to evaluating whether to use a swamp cooler.\nSo, even in humid states, you will have hot and dry days. On these days, a swamp cooler is definitely worth getting.\nClimate zones within states Furthermore, there are very different climate zones within states.\nFor example, in California, there is the bay area, which is humid, and the deserts in the backcountry deserts, which are very dry.\nWhile in the bay area, a swamp cooler does not make sense, in the dry areas it does make sense.\nThat is the case for almost any state. Even if the tables above say that on average a swamp cooler is not worth getting, oftentimes it can still be worth it, depending on the humidity at your home.\nHow to measure your home’s humidity The best way to tell whether a swamp cooler works where you live is to measure your local humidity.\nAfter you know the humidity levels around your house, you can tell whether the local weather around your home deviates from the state-wide average.\nYou can easily measure humidity using a hygrometer (click here to view it on amazon).\nFor example, where I live, there is vastly different climate than in the other parts of my state. That’s because my home is in an area with small mountains and a lot of forest.\nWhen I watch weather forecasts, I can immediately tell that the temperature at my home is going to be at least 5°F cooler.\nAlternatively: You can also check your city-specific climate online. I like to use weather.com. Enter your city in the search box and view the weather table.\nHow to interpret humidity readings for swamp cooler effectivity Once you have the humidity readings of your hygrometer (or the weather website), you can judge whether a swamp cooler is worth getting.\nHere’s the golden swamp cooler rule:\n“A swamp cooler is worth running if the humidity reaches 50% or lower over the course of a day”\nSo, even if mornings are very humid in your area (as they are in most places), a swamp cooler is still worth getting if the humidity decreases during the hot hours of the day.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/where-do-swamp-coolers-work-us-states/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhether a swamp cooler works depends on the climate in your area.

And is there a risk of the electronics blowing up?\nQuick answer: Yes, you can run a swamp cooler all day. Swamp coolers do not add humidity to your room indefinitely, because they run at room temperature (and don’t boil the water like a kettle). Also, they run on very little electric power, so they don’t overheat. To maximize running time, lubricate the fan every year.\nBefore we check why you can run a swamp cooler all day, let’s first have a look at why you oftentimes think you can’t run an electric device as long as you wish:\nWhy HVAC companies set time limitations for devices that can run indefinitely In my experience, electronics manufacturers, and especially HVAC manufacturers spread fear and uncertainty. User manuals tell you that things are dangerous and you should not run a device longer than X hours.\nAnd not only air conditioning companies do that. I’ve seen it with heaters and even gaming consoles. Spreading uncertainty about a topic is a way for companies to protect themselves.\nFor example:\nImagine your swamp cooler catches on fire (don’t worry, it won’t).\nYou sue the swamp cooler company for the fire damage. But they respond with “Oh, you were running your swamp cooler for more than 2 hours continuously. We are not accountable since our user manual prohibits running the device for that long”.\nThe real problem, is, however, not the running time of the swamp cooler. Any quality swamp cooler can run indefinitely.\nThe problem is that some swamp cooler companies use very cheap parts to manufacture their swamp coolers.\nAnd if something goes wrong, for example, the fan bearings break and the fan doesn’t blow anymore, or the electronics stop working, the company can blame any faults on your usage instead of taking accountability for their quality problems.\nThat’s why you see so many devices (not just swamp coolers) have running time limitations in their user manuals.\nThis is obviously a hoax and merely legal protection.\nLet’s have a look at what really happens when you run a swamp cooler for a very long time:\nRoom humidity after long running time A swamp cooler will never make your room too humid, no matter how long you run it. Here’s why:\nThere’s a big misconception many people have that the longer you run a swamp cooler, the more water evaporates and the more humid the air in your room becomes.\nThis is false!\nA swamp cooler can’t evaporate water indefinitely since it does not add heat to the water.\nMany people think of swamp coolers like a kettle boiling water. The longer the water boils, the more humid the air becomes. This is only possible because the stove forces the water in the kettle to evaporate through heat.\nA swamp cooler merely blows air over wet sponges. If the air in your room is already humid, a swamp cooler can not add more humidity.\nAnd if the air in your room is hot, it evaporates water. If it is cool, no water evaporates.\nWhen you run a swamp cooler in a dry room, the humidity level rises until it reaches a certain temperature-dependent humidity threshold.\nAfter the air reaches this humidity, a swamp cooler can not possibly make it more humid.\n“A swamp cooler is basically self-regulating as to the amount of moisture it injects into the conditioned space.”\nDavid Andersen from the inspection community\nThe maximum humidity threshold your room can reach depends on two factors, which are air pressure and temperature.\nPressure is roughly constant around the globe (except in high-altitude areas). The temperature, however, varies.\nYour swamp cooler, therefore, self-adapts to the temperature. If it is hot, it evaporates a lot of water. If it is cold, it doesn’t.\nA long swamp cooler running time has no effect on the humidity levels in your room. After your room’s humidity level reaches the maximum, your swamp cooler stops evaporating more water.\nYou can run your swamp cooler however long you like. It does not matter. Just make sure to vent your room thoroughly a couple of times a day to equalize indoor and outdoor humidity levels.\nCan a swamp cooler overload the wall outlet? For any device to overload your home’s electric circuit, it needs to draw more power than the electric circuit can handle.\nIn the US, a standard wall outlet supports a voltage of 110V. In Europe, a wall outlet provides 230V of power.\nWith a regular 15 Amps circuit breaker, this means, a wall outlet supports the following maximum power output:\n**Region****Maximum power (with 15 Amps circuit breaker)**US (110V outlet)1650 WattsEurope (230V outlet)3450 Watts\n( To calculate these values, I used this formula: Power = Voltage × Amperage )\nBy the way: 15 Amps circuit breakers are the smallest amperage circuit breakers. It could be that your home has stronger 20 Amps or higher circuit breakers installed. I am using 15 Amps for the calculations to account for the worst case.\nAs you can see in the table, any wall outlet supports 1650 Watts. European outlets support even more.\nA large swamp cooler uses only 250W of power. That is only 15% of what your wall outlet can handle.\nMost swamp coolers use even less power, e.g. 100W or 150W.\nIn theory, you can run up to 6 large swamp coolers simultaneously without overloading the circuit.\nElectric circuitry does not overheat or break when it runs all day. A good example is your fridge. It runs 24/7 and draws more power than a swamp cooler does (up to 400W and more depending on size).\nYou can safely run your swamp cooler all day. At least if we only approach the question from this purely electrical perspective.\nLet’s check it from the mechanical perspective:\nWill your swamp cooler break if you run it for too long? Does a swamp cooler wear down and break if it runs for too long? This depends on the quality of the moving parts inside your swamp cooler:\nthe pump fan bearings Moving parts always cause friction. And friction wears parts down over time. If you run your swamp cooler 24/7, at some point in time it will break, guaranteed.\nLet’s check how long your swamp cooler lasts if you run it continuously.\nBall bearings lifespan The ball bearings of a typical fan last for 50,000 hours of continuous usage.\nThis means you can run your swamp cooler for\n50,000 hours ÷ 24 hours per day ≈ 2083 days\ncontinuously.\nThat is about\n2083 days ÷ 365 days a year ≈ 5 years 8 months and 2 weeks\nAfter this, your bearings will break.\nThis is, of course, just an average value. Sometimes bearings last a lot longer than you’d ever expect (which is why some cars run 200,000 miles and more), while others break down much earlier.\nSwamp cooler water pump lifespan An electric water pump lasts 10 to 15 years ( source). So, it is not the limiting factor of your swamp cooler’s lifespan.\nHowever, I could not really find any source about the actual running time of water pumps. Any source online just states “10 to 15 years”, but I highly doubt that this is 10 to 15 years of continuous running time.\nI bet it isn’t.\nI’d estimate a pump to last for 5 years if it runs continuously. Does that sound similar to the lifespan of ball bearings, which is also 5 years?\nThat’s because the motor inside the pump runs onbearings. Bearings always do the heavy lifting and the most movement in mechanics, and thus they are the parts that break down.\nBut, because that’s the case, and we humans need bearings so much, most bearings, even in cheap devices are of good quality.\nManufacturers perfected the art of bearing production. 5 years of continuous running time is impressive.\nHow to make your swamp cooler last longer Now that we know that the only moving parts that can break in a swamp cooler are bearings, we can improve their lifespan:\n“To reduce friction and minimize overheating, fans need lubrication.” pelonistechnologies.com\nThe simplest way to do that is to lubricate any moving parts once or twice a year. Lubricate the fan and, if accessible, the pump.\nYou don’t have to use a special lubricant. Just use bike lubricant or WD-40 or whatever.\nAlso, rinse and clean the sponge occasionally. This not only removes the smell, but also reduces the sponge’s airflow resistance.\nIf your sponge is clean, your fan does not have to exert as much force to pass air through it.\nAlthough this is a small effect, it will add up when you run your swamp cooler all day.\nWill a swamp cooler overheat? A swamp cooler will not overheat. Swamp coolers use way too little power to cause anything to melt or become overly hot.\nAnd even if that was the case, the water in your swamp cooler would absorb the heat and evaporate it.\nSo, it is almost impossible for a swamp cooler to overheat, no matter how long you run it for.\nHow much does running a swamp cooler all day cost? Assuming an average electricity cost of 23 cents per Kilowatt-hour:\nSwamp cooler size****Cost for running 24 hours250W$1.38100W$0.5550W$0.27\nAs you can see, swamp coolers are very affordable to run all day.\nFor comparison, a typical air conditioner consumes 800W of power which would be $4.41 per 24 hours.\nRunning a swamp cooler overnight The biggest downside of using an evaporative cooler all day (and night), is the noise.\nSwamp coolers make a lot of noise.\nThey are comparable to strong fans.\nEven if their sales page advertises low noise levels, they are still noisy.\nYou can’t silently force air through tiny holes in a sponge. There just has to be noise.\nAt night, swamp cooler noise is very annoying.\nSo, either turn your swamp cooler off at night or, if you really need it, use earplugs for sleep.\nConclusion You can run a swamp cooler all day. It does not make your room overly humid because it can not add humidity to your room indefinitely.\nA swamp cooler can theoretically run continuously for years. It does not overheat and does not have any parts that easily break down.\nSo, run your swamp cooler however long you like!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-a-swamp-cooler-run-all-day/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you run a swamp cooler all day?

What happens when they run out of water?\nQuick answer: A swamp cooler will not catch fire, even when the water runs out. Swamp coolers run on low wattages, which makes overheating highly unlikely. Swap coolers are the safest cooling devices (together with fans).\nDo swamp coolers overheat when they run out of water? A swamp cooler is a fan that blows air through wet sponge.\nWhen your swamp cooler runs out of water, it blows air through the dry sponge.\nOne common cause of fire is the accumulation of heat energy in a small space. However, there is always airflow in a swamp cooler. The fan still blows air when the water runs out.\nSo, a swamp cooler does not accumulate heat. It dissipates the heat into the room.\nA swamp cooler without water is still a fan. Fans don’t catch fire because they distribute hot air.\nCan swamp coolers overheat due to electronic failure Of course, a swamp cooler can overheat when there is a fault in the electronic circuitry. But this is never due to the swamp cooler running out of water.\nIf a swamp cooler has an electronic fault, it can catch fire even when the water supply is still active.\nThis can happen to any electric device. And swamp coolers consume such little power, I’d claim running a fridge or a TV is more dangerous.\nOverheating due to electronic failure is very unlikely. Because most swamp coolers run on low power, overheating can only happen when the electronic components that sit inside the swamp cooler are too cheap or don’t suit the use case.\nAs long as you have a decent-quality swamp cooler, it is very unlikely that the electronics will ever overheat.\nI recommended my all-time favorite sturdy swamp coolers in this recommended swamp cooler article (it’s about swamp coolers in garages, but these are precisely the best quality swamp coolers with the best airflow).\nSwamp cooler overheat risk by size The maximum temperature of a device depends (among a few other factors) on the power it consumes.\nSwamp coolers are low-power devices. Naturally, they don’t run hot. None of the temperatures in the table below is high enough to start a fire.\n**Swamp cooler sizeMaximum component temperatureIs it hot enough to catch fire?**250 Watts (big)122°Fno100 Watts (regular)104°Fno50 Watts (small)85°Fno\nAs you can see, even large swamp coolers are fire safe. Usually, the fan motor warms up while running, until it reaches its maximum temperature.\nBut still, there’s nothing to worry about.\nHow I got these numbers (skip if you don’t like maths) For the temperature estimation, I use the following assumption:\nNo motor is 100% efficient. A swamp cooler fan motor dissipates 10% of the energy as heat.\nBased on this assumption, I can estimate the maximum temperature of the internal components, e.g. the motor and the electronics.\nAt home, I have a 7 Watts heating pad for reference.\nFor example, the small 50W swamp cooler will generate 5W of heating power. My 7W heating pad gets about 90°F hot. If 0W corresponds to a room temperature of 77°F, that means 5W should be around 85°F.\nPlease note that temperature does not rise linearly with power. So, I am estimating logarithmically.\nIn which case can a swamp cooler catch a fire? Swamp coolers only ever catch fire due to electronic or mechanical failure. A normal-running swamp cooler will not catch fire on its own.\nWhich parts in a swamp cooler can catch fire? 1. Built-in fan The built-in fan itself is unlikely to catch fire. But it can cause a fire in the electronics if it stops moving.\nThis can happen when something blocks the rotational movement of the fan. For example, when a broken part blocks the fan, or when the fan bearings break.\nThen, the fan does not absorb the power the power electronics deliver to it. The input power, however, has to go somewhere.\nAnd usually, this leads to a single electronic part or a wire to overheat or blow up.\nThis scenario is very unlikely. A swamp cooler fan does not simply block itself from moving. And normally, bearings also don’t break down.\nThe only fan-blocking scenario I can think of is a wasp nest inside your swamp cooler.\nTo prevent this, you can get a swamp cooler cover (click here to view one on amazon).\n2. Power cord Most power cords can easily handle the power of a swamp cooler. AC power cords, for example, have to withstand at least 3x the amount of power of a swamp cooler.\nAnd you rarely hear about ACs that cause fires.\nSwamp coolers need 2.4 Amps at most. Even some phone chargers can deliver \u0026gt;2.0 Amps.\nSo, it’s really not that much.\nThe only way a swamp cooler power cord can catch fire is if is either\nbroken (through dog or cats nagging on it or loose contact from heavy usage) loosely connected to the wall outlet loosely connected to the swamp cooler But as long as you firmly connect the power cord and it does not have any visible faults, it won’t cause a fire.\nI’ve written an article on how to fix a swamp cooler power cord here.\n3. Power electronics inside the swamp cooler Another point of failure is the power electronics driving the fan inside the swamp cooler.\nThe power electronics component receives the input power from your wall outlet, converts it, and forwards it to the fan, depending on the airspeed setting you set.\nEspecially cheap devices often have bad-quality power electronics, with parts that barely suit the voltage requirements.\nIf this is the case, things can stop working or even blow up in the electronics.\nBut it is still very unlikely that any part catches fire.\nI’ve worked in an electronics manufacturing plant once. And the only time I saw an electronic circuit board catching fire was when there was a short circuit. So, it has to be a major quality issue for something to go wrong.\nIf your swamp cooler had a short circuit, it would never even turn on. So, if you ever see your swamp cooler working, there is no short circuit and nothing to worry about.\n( Of course, things falling onto the circuitry or water droplets can cause short circuits too. But generally, the power electronics are separate from any moving parts and separate from the water. )\n4. Extension cord For air conditioners, you need high-quality extension cords. But swamp coolers use such little power that even cheap extension cords suffice.\nAs long as you tightly connect the extension cord with your swamp cooler’s power cord and the wall outlet, you are safe.\nConclusion Swamp coolers don’t catch fire, even if they run out of water. There is just no component inside a swamp cooler that receives enough electric power to start a fire.\nOn top of that, swamp coolers distribute air. So, they would blow away all the heat that accumulates inside.\nSwamp coolers are very safe devices. They are much safer than regular ACs, which run on very high power, and almost, but not quite as fire-proof as a regular fan.\nThe only difference between a swamp cooler and a fan is the casing and the electronic circuitry.\nSo, there is more material to catch fire.\nBut in principle, both swamp coolers and regular fans, are fans. Fans don’t catch fire.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-a-swamp-cooler-catch-on-fire/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan a swamp cooler catch on fire?

In this article, we’re looking at the 3 best swamp coolers to use in a bedroom.\nQuick answer: The best bedroom swamp coolers are the Hessaire MC37M and MC18M models. Their water tanks last for a full night if you run them on half-power. Alternatively, you can connect them to a tap for continuous refills.\nAfter checking my 3 different recommendations, we will also have a look at whether it makes sense to run a swamp cooler in your bedroom and see if there are better alternatives for you.\nA simple fan or a portable air conditioner could be the better choice.\nLet’s have a look first.\n3 Best swamp coolers for bedrooms 1. Hessaire MC37M (for regular and large bedrooms) My all-time favorite is this Hessaire MC37M Swamp Cooler (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt is a bit bulky and doesn’t look great. But it is one of the few swamp coolers that actually cool rooms down significantly.\nIt is easy to maintain. There are many replacement parts. And it will last you for a very long time if you care for it.\nThe Hessaire MC37M has more than enough power to cool down even the largest bedrooms.\nPersonally, this is my all-time favorite swamp cooler. And you can use it everywhere. I recommended this specific model for garages before. You can also easily move it to the living room, or even use it outdoors.\nFor example, you can cool down guests sitting at a table during a summer BBQ.\nSo, that’s why it is my #1 choice. It is versatile, you can use it anywhere you need it, and it is robust.\nDrawback: It does not look nice in most bedrooms.\nBut honestly, there are no swamp coolers that look good AND work. At least I don’t know of any. If you get a swamp cooler purely based on looks, you might just as well get none.\n2. Hessaire MC18M (for small bedrooms) For smaller bedrooms, I recommend this Hessaire MC18M swamp cooler (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis swamp cooler is smaller in size and blows less air. Also, it is quieter.\nThe main drawback of the Hessaire MC18M is, I would say, that you are restricted to usage in small rooms due to the decreased power.\nHessaire claims this swamp cooler can cool up to 500 sq. ft, but I highly doubt that. Let’s not trust the manufacturer too much here.\nI’d estimate you can use this swamp cooler for rooms up to 250 sq. ft.\nThat’s enough for most bedrooms, but definitely not enough for garages, living rooms or outdoors.\nIf you know you need a swamp cooler for bedroom usage only, then you can comfortably get this model.\nBut in general, I’d pick the bigger brother model (from the previous section), just to be safe.\n3. Air Choice swamp cooler (for small bedrooms) Most people probably prefer the clean white look of this Air Choice swamp cooler (click here to view it on amazon).\nBut even though this swamp cooler looks like it’s strong, it can barely keep up with the (small) Hessaire MC18M.\nThere’s not much bad to say about this Air Choice swamp cooler. It is just much larger than it needs to be.\nActually, it has only about 41% of the airflow power when we compare it with the #1 recommendation from this article.\nI recommend getting this swamp cooler only if you care a lot about appearance and this model just happens to fit your bedroom colors very well.\nBut don’t expect too much.\n( I’d pick any of the two other swamp coolers over this one )\nDo swamp coolers make sense in a bedroom? Technically, you can use a swamp cooler wherever you like.\nThere are, however, a few drawbacks to using a swamp cooler in your bedroom.\nHere’s a quick list:\nSwamp coolers don’t work well in bedrooms Bedrooms have increased moisture levels. I have a hygrometer, which measures humidity, in my bedroom.\nWhen I go to bed, the humidity is usually around 45%. When I wake up in the morning the humidity is 70%.\nOver the course of a night, the air in a bedroom accumulates a lot of water from sweat, breath, and evaporation.\nSo, you are already acting like a human swamp cooler… (sounds weird). You increase the room\u0026rsquo;s humidity levels, which, temporarily, decreases its temperature.\nSwamp coolers only work well in dry environments, because the drier the air, the more water can evaporate and absorb heat energy from the air.\nIf your bedroom already has high humidity, a swamp cooler won’t really cool any further.\nIn dry climates, swamp coolers, will, of course, still work.\nLet me conclude it like this:\nIf you live in very dry environments, a swamp cooler will work perfectly fine in your bedroom. In regular humidity, your night breathing and sweating will reduce the efficiency of your swamp cooler. And in humid environments, a swamp cooler won’t work anyways. Swamp cooler noise Swamp coolers are noisy. They are at least as noisy as a fan.\nIf you have problems falling asleep, a swamp cooler will definitely not help. You can, of course, use earplugs to block out the noise.\nOr simply run the swamp cooler at lower air speeds.\nWater refills during the night Swamp coolers need water to work. There are two ways to refill a swamp cooler. Either you attach a garden hose to the swamp cooler to continuously refill the swamp cooler, or you refill the built-in water tank yourself.\nMost bedrooms don’t have access to a water source, so you are restricted to manual refills.\nOn full power, a swamp cooler tank will last 3-4 hours. But if you run your swamp cooler on half power, it should last the full night.\nMoisture accumulation in fabrics A swamp cooler will increase humidity and thus also the humidity of the fabrics in your bedroom. This can be bedsheets, but also clothes and rugs.\nIf you run your swamp cooler for too long without venting your room, this increases bacteria and mite growth.\nYou can counter that by venting your room every few hours. A quick 5 to 10 minutes long vent will (ideally with a fan, while your swamp cooler is running) remove most of the moisture from your room.\nAlso, regularly dust and vacuum your room. Dust is a breeding ground for bacteria, especially when combined with the humid air from your swamp cooler.\nBacteria growth in your swamp cooler If your bedroom is dusty, your swamp cooler will accumulate a lot of that dust on the built-in sponges.\nWet sponges and dust are not a healthy combination.\nSo, make sure, your bedroom is tidy and clean and you regularly vent it.\nThe air coming out of your swamp cooler reflects the cleanliness of your room.\nYou can, of course, rinse the swamp cooler sponges once a week, or whenever your swamp cooler starts stinking.\nFood in your bedroom A humid room might reduce the expiration duration of your food. Food might go bad quicker.\nHow long food lasts depends mainly on temperature and humidity.\nSo, while swamp coolers reduce the temperature of your room, they increase humidity. Especially dry foods can grow mold quicker.\nSo, don’t keep any food in your bedroom while using a swamp cooler.\nActually, you should keep food out of your bedroom anyways. Especially in the summer heat!\nShould you get a swamp cooler for your bedroom? Swamp coolers only make sense in dry climates. Before you buy a swamp cooler for your bedroom, I recommend you measure your bedroom humidity before you go to bed and after you wake up.\nYou can use these digital hygrometers (click here to view them on amazon) to measure humidity around your home.\n**Bedroom humidity level****Does a swamp cooler make sense?**under 50%yes50 - 70%yes, but reduced efficiencyover 70%no\nIf you care for your room, clean it regularly, and don’t store any food there, there is no reason not to get a swamp cooler.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-swamp-coolers-for-bedrooms/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere are \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e few swamp coolers that are actually good.

Let’s have a look at the best swamp coolers specifically for garages!\nWhen I looked for garage swamp coolers online, I was actually a bit surprised by the lack of information about garage swamp coolers. I mean, when you look for garage swamp coolers, you want a sturdy, durable, and maintainable device, that will last you for many summers.\nYou usually don’t care about looks. You don’t want plastic screws. You want a swamp cooler that can take a hit, and which you can easily move around the garage.\nThis article is about my favorite swamp cooler. And if you know my other articles, you know I prefer durable, honest products over cheap crap that just looks good.\nQuick answer: The best swamp cooler for most garages is the Hessaire MC37M. It’s got enough power to cool even spacey garages and it is very durable. The dark greyish material won’t stain, even if you touch it with greasy hands, which makes it perfect specifically for garages.\nAdditionally, Hessaire is the go-to brand when it comes to swamp coolers for me. They are quality products and will last you many summers!\nMost other swamp coolers are low-quality, glossy-white, China-made plastic products. I just can’t imagine them doing a good job in a garage.\nI picked 3 different-sized swamp coolers for you. By coincidence, they are all from Hessaire. As soon as I find another good-quality brand, I will add it here. (Shoot me an email if you know one).\nHere are my choices:\nSwamp cooler recommendations by garage size Garage size****Recommended swamp coolersmall (1 or 2 cars)Hessaire MC18M (click here to view it on amazon)regular (2, or 3 cars) (best in most cases)Hessaire MC37M (click here to view it on amazon)large (3, 4, or more cars)Hessaire MC61M (click here to view it on amazon)\nLet’s have a look at each of those coolers in a bit more detail, starting the best garage swamp cooler for most cases:\nSwamp cooler for regular-size garages (2 or 3 cars) This Hessaire MC37M swamp cooler (click here to view it on amazon) is my recommended choice for 90% of garages.\nIt’s got more than enough power for most garages, while not being too big and bulky. It’s a large device, no question, but, I’d say, this one is the sweet spot.\nThe MC37M blows 3,100 cubic feet of air per minute. That is almost as much as a strong floor fan can blow. However, the swamp cooler forces that much air through the water-soaked sponge, while floor fans blow the air without resistance.\nSo, this air throughput is already quite impressive. For comparison, other swamp coolers you find online have a square foot per minute (CFM) rating of around 2,000.\nMost manufacturers don’t even specify a rating (so you can expect a rating much lower than that).\nThe maximum power usage is 250W, which is just a fraction of the 800W - 1,000W an air conditioner would require.\nAccording to the manufacturer, this is enough to cool garages up to 750 square feet (70 m²). That’s almost, but not quite, the size of a 4-car garage.\nI never fully trust manufacturer information. From my experience, you should always get coolers that can easily cool the space you want to cool. Otherwise, you won’t really notice a cooling effect.\nFor example, when I picked a portable air conditioner for my living room, I got a cheap one that is barely rated at the size of my living room. As a result, it does not cool at all. Had I just spent $50 more for the right size, I would not have wasted my money.\nSo, for 4 car garages, I highly recommend you get the larger model (in the next section) instead.\nContinuous water refill For large projects in the garage, it is always good to not have to refill the water. All Hessaire swamp coolers have a built-in garden hose adapter for continuous water refill.\nIf you don’t have a garden hose, you can use the 10.3-gallon water tank. It lasts for 3-4 hours of continuous usage. After that, you have to refill the tank.\nA full day in the garage (8 hours) would need 2 or 3 refills.\nSo, I recommend using the hose adapter to have a continuous flow of water.\n10.3-gallon water tank for 3-4 hours of use (annoying to refill for longer sessions in the garage).\nSturdy surface material for garages What really makes the Hessair MC37M perfect for garages is, in addition to the cooling power, the surface material.\nIt is not a white, glossy surface (as most swamp coolers), but it’s a dark matt gray, which won’t look bad even after months of usage in the garage.\nThe material is not scratch resistant, because it’s still plastic. However, on the matt surface finish scratches don’t show as much as when you scratch a white, shiny, glossy indoor swamp cooler.\nAdditionally, dust is not a problem and you can touch the swamp cooler with oily and greasy hands.\nI mean, it looks like a robust device designed for workmen. So, you can use it like one.\nMost people would probably call Hessaire swamp coolers ugly. But they just fit the needs of a garage.\nMost importantly, they just work.\nHessaire is one of the better swamp cooler brands, and this particular model has over 4,400 positive reviews on amazon.\nIn the garage, you can pick quality over looks. It doesn’t have to blend in with home decor or fit behind your couch or whatever.\nRolling wheels for portability This garage swamp cooler has rolling wheels. There are some indoor swamp coolers that don’t have wheels.\nThis one has wheels. In general, this is nothing special, but in the garage, you will likely move it around more depending on where you work.\nMost indoor swamp coolers (for living rooms or bedrooms) have wheels too. But some don’t, since you place them in one spot and leave them there for the summer.\nJust something to consider.\nSwamp cooler for large garages (3, 4, or more cars) If you have a garage for 3 or more cars, I recommend getting the larger model, the Hessaire MC61M (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis one is basically the same swamp cooler system as the regular-size garage model I recommended. The only differences are in size and power.\nThe Hessaire MC61M is designed for large spaces and outputs 5,300 cubic feet of air per minute, which is as strong as a high-velocity fan.\nAnd remember, the MC61M achieves this airflow even though it has to force air through wet sponge!\nIt consumes 430W of power, so it costs more to run than the other swamp coolers. But 430W to cool large spaces is totally fine. It’s still less than what the smallest air conditioners consume.\nAt an average electricity price of 23 cents per Kilowatt-hour (kWh) in the US, that amounts to close to 10 cents an hour.\nAccording to the manufacturer’s datasheet, this swamp cooler can cool up to 1,600 sq. ft.\nSo, that’s more than enough for most garages.\nSwamp cooler for small garages (1 or 2 cars) For small garages, I recommend this Hessaire MC18M swamp cooler (click here to view it on amazon).\nJust like the larger swamp coolers, this one comes with a built-in garden hose adapter. And if you don’t have access to water, you can run this swamp cooler off the 4.8-gallon water tank for 3-4 hours.\nBonus tip: Swamp cooler cover to keep dust and insects away If you want your swamp cooler to last you a long time, take care of it.\nI recommend getting this Hessaire cooler cover (click here to view it on amazon) along with the cooler.\nIt protects the swamp cooler from dust (e.g. if you do woodwork in your garage). But also, it keeps insects and other animals away. You don’t want a wasp nest in your cooler.\nSummary That’s it. You are set for cooling your garage!\nMy favorite is the Hessaire MC37M as it fits most common garage sizes along with the protective cover.\nHessaire swamp coolers are simply the best choice for garages. They are not “hype” products like other brands. They are simple, robust, and work.\nWhich is just what we need in a garage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-swamp-coolers-for-garages/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGarages get very hot in the summer.

Typically, they are the parts that ignite and measure the pilot light.\nLuckily, a Dyna-Glo heater not lighting is usually easy to fix.\nLet’s look at all the possible problems and how you can fix them.\nHow to fix a Dyna-Glo heater not lighting Your Dyna-Glo heater is not lighting. So, to find out the cause of your issue, we have to trace the path of ignition, starting with the tank, followed by the propane hose, the igniter, the pilot light, and the thermocouple.\nAny ignition fault in a Dyna-Glo heater must be in one of those components. There is no way around it.\nLet’s have a look at things in order, starting with the tank.\nQuick answer: Dyna-Glo heaters usually don’t light when the pilot light is clogged, the thermocouple is dirty, or when the igniter doesn’t spark. Clean all of those parts with rubbing alcohol and a Q-tip. Then, check each part of those parts individually. Also, use the right gas compatible with your Dyna-Glo heater. And use a new gas hose.\nNatural / Propane gas tank issues There are two things about your gas tank that cause issues.\nGas tank empty The most obvious issue is an empty gas tank. When there’s no gas inside the tank, it, obviously, won’t light.\nThe simplest way to check whether your gas tank or gas bottle contains gas is to lift and shake it.\nYou should hear the sound of liquid splashing around inside the gas tank.\nAlternatively, you can touch the sides of the gas tank. If there is gas inside, the lower part of the tank should feel a lot colder than the top (assuming a partially filled tank).\nThis is because your hand’s warmth evaporates the gas inside. The evaporation wicks away heat from your hand which makes the bottle feel cold.\nIf you find your gas bottle is empty, then recharge it or exchange it with a full bottle at a hardware store.\nGas leaking from hose or tank Of course, once you know your gas tank or gas bottle is empty, the cause of why your tank is empty might still be there.\nTo check for leaks, set up your Dyna-Glo heater and connect it to the gas tank. Open the gas valve.\nThen, apply a soapy solution (water + soap) to the gas valve and to the gas hose.\nDo bubbles form anywhere? Or can you smell gas?\nIf you find a leak in your gas tank’s valve, I’d suggest replacing the entire gas tank.\nAnd if there are any leaks on the hose or on its connectors, replace the hose with this Natural Gas / Propane hose (click here to view it on amazon).\nWrong gas used Many Dyna-Glo heaters are compatible with both natural and propane gas. You can’t connect a propane gas hose to a natural gas heater and vice versa unless you have a conversion kit.\nSome Dyna-Glo heaters, however, are only compatible with one of the gases. So, if you use the wrong gas with them (with a conversion kit you already had at home), your Dyna-Glo heater won’t light.\nThis is a very unlikely issue. But I still wanted to mention it.\nDouble-check your Dyna-Glo heater’s box or manual and see which gas you can use it with.\nIf you don’t have these things anymore, check the serial number on the case and look for the specs online.\nPilot light issues Pilot light issues are the most frequent issues in Dyna-Glo gas heaters. The pilot light is a small test flame that your heater uses to verify that the gas burns properly.\nThe pilot light’s gas line is branched off the main gas line.\nA Dyna-Glo heater checks the pilot light’s temperature using a so-called thermocouple. The thermocouple is a very simple electric thermometer that can withstand very high temperatures since it is made of metal only.\nSo, thermocouples are perfect for measuring flame temperatures.\nOnly when the pilot light burns properly, your heater turns on the main gas line, which you need for heating. This both a safety and an energy-saving mechanism.\nImproper burn causes toxic carbon monoxide emissions. And, on top of that, it produces a lot less heat than an ideal burn.\nSo, not only does it save your life, but it also saves your money. Perfect.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what the pilot light in gas heaters looks like. In this case, the flame is too short to reach the thermocouple (opposite the flame), which causes the main gas line to not open.\nPilot light orifice clogged Does a flame come out of the pilot light orifice when you light your Dyna-Glo heater? If yes, that’s good.\nBut if you are not able to even light the pilot light, then your pilot light is likely clogged.\nA clogged pilot light is the most frequent issue in propane heaters!\nPilot lights clog with time from oil coming out of the gas hose. The most frequent cause of this is that you use your gas tank without a filter.\nTo fix it you need a Q-tip and rubbing alcohol. Soak the Q-tip in rubbing alcohol and clean the oil and grease in the pilot light orifice.\nAdditionally, to prevent this from happening in the future use a gas line filter. I recommend this propane gas line filter (click here to view it on amazon).\nSome Dyna-Glo heaters (I don’t know if all) have a built-in fuel filter. So, actually, you don’t need to buy an additional filter. But you can just to make sure.\nFor now, you can test your Dyna-Glo heater with the cleaned orifice. Does it light now?\nPilot light flame not hot or large enough The thermocouple constantly monitors the temperature of the pilot light’s flame. Too-short flames, or flames that do not burn properly usually cause the thermocouple to close the main gas line, and, therefore prevent your heater from lighting.\nHere, the first thing to do is also to clean out the pilot light with a Q-tip and rubbing alcohol.\nIf that doesn’t fix the issue, check the hose.\nThere might be a pressure drop somewhere in the hose, causing the flame to not get enough gas. This could be due to oil buildup inside the hose or due to leaks.\nIdeally, you should cross-check this with a second gas hose.\nIf you think the hose is the issue, then get a new gas hose (such as the one I recommended earlier).\nIgniter defective Another possible issue that can cause your Dyna-Glo heater to not light anymore is a broken igniter.\nNormally, igniters are very durable and last a long time. But there is a slim chance that yours is broken.\nThe igniter sits next to the pilot light orifice and creates a spark when you turn on the heater.\nYou can easily test for a broken igniter by trying to light your heater. See if the igniter sparks.\nIf it doesn’t spark, it is broken.\nAlso, to eliminate any other problem, try lighting the pilot light with a regular lighter. Either use a lighter with a long head, such as those you use for wood stoves. Or remove the Dyna-Glo protection grid if you use a regular lighter.\nIf only the igniter is not working, then your heater should turn on when you light it using a regular lighter.\nSo, if you’re lazy you can stop here and always light your Dyna-Glo heater with a lighter. Or you can replace the igniter.\nI recommend getting these replacement spark plugs (click here to view them on amazon).\nThey are generic and should fit most Dyna-Glo models.\nJust to make sure, you can already disassemble your Dyna-Glo heater and see whether the igniter (or spark plug) inside looks similar.\nThe replacement is very simple. Just unplug and remove the built-in spark plug (which is attached to the case with one screw) and replace it with a new one.\nThis should take 5-10 minutes at most.\nThermocouple broken When the thermocouple is defective, it can’t signal the main gas line to open. Typically, when your pilot light lights and it burns with a blue color, the cause for the rest of the heater not turning on is a broken thermocouple.\nNormally, thermocouples don’t break. They are very durable metal parts. They don’t move, so they don’t wear down due to friction. And they can withstand very high temperatures.\nAnd that’s why most gas heaters use thermocouples instead of other electric thermometers.\nThermocouples can only break upon impact, wrong reassembly (e.g. a wire not properly connected), or due to corrosion, especially when the heater is placed outside.\nThe first fix I’d suggest is to clean the thermocouple. There may be grease or dirt on it which prevents it from picking up the correct temperature.\nTo clean it, use rubbing alcohol (or, actually, any cleaner you like), and rub the thermocouple clean. It sits in front of the pilot light orifice, so you have to remove the protection grid of your Dyna-Glo heater to access it.\nThen, try lighting your Dyna-Glo heater and see if it works.\nIf it still doesn’t work, the thermocouple is likely broken. I’d suggest replacing the entire thing. Thermocouples are cheap to get!\nTo fix it, get this Dyna-Glo replacement thermocouple (click here to view it on amazon).\nUnscrew and unplug the broken thermocouple and replace it with the new one.\nTest your heater. It should work now!\nWhat to do if your Dyna-Glo heater is still not lighting? Cleaning the pilot light, and the thermocouple, and ensuring a proper gas supply should fix most Dyna-Glo heaters that don’t have severe defects.\nIf you still can’t get your Dyna-Glo heater to work, there might be a bigger issue.\nIn this case, you can either hire someone to troubleshoot your Dyna-Glo heater in person.\nI’ve also written an article about propane heaters that keep shutting off. Maybe you can find one or two useful tips there that point you in the right direction.\nOr you can just get a new heater and save yourself time.\nI recommend getting this 30,000 BTU Dyna-Glo heater (click here to see it on amazon).\nAlternatively, if you are not happy with Dyna-Glo anymore, then you can also try another brand.\nPersonally, I really like my Mr. Heater propane heaters (although they are not wall-mounted). Here’s a review if portable heaters are an option for you.\nAnd for (mostly) wall-mounted propane heaters, here’s a list of the best ventless propane heaters.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-a-dyna-glo-heater-not-lighting/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOnly a few parts can cause a Dyna-Glo heater not lighting.

In this article, we’re going to check everything you can do to fix it.\nUnfortunately, the official Vornado website is not helpful at all. All you get is a “troubleshooting” document that tells you to turn the heater off and on. Not helpful at all.\nAnother tip you get in the document is to not use your heater with a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) safety wall outlet… which is, in my opinion, pointless advice.\nIf your heater trips a safety outlet (which signals something is wrong), why should you risk running it on a regular wall outlet that can blow up or start a fire?\nTheir third tip is to contact customer service. Great.\nTo summarize: Vornado’s website is not helpful at all.\nIn the end, Vornade employees make a living by selling you heaters and not by helping you fix your broken heaters. So, they are not to be trusted.\nInstead, let me help you. I am Daniel, an electrical engineer, and I am more capable of troubleshooting a heater together with you than Vornado’s online marketing team.\nAfter reading this article, you’ll know the most common real causes of a Vornado heater not heating, as well as how you can fix them.\nAnd even if can’t fix your heater, there’s still a way out. So, stick out until the end!\nSo, let’s start troubleshooting!\nHow to fix a Vornado Heater not working There are different symptoms of a Vornado heater not working. For example, your space heater might not turn on at all. Or it turns on, but it blows only cold air.\nAll of these symptoms have different causes. I’ve got you covered with all of them!\nQuick answer: To fix a Vornado heater not working, open the case, remove dust that causes overheating and inspect the electronic circuitry. Ensure that the wall outlet is powered, the extension cord doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a loose contact. And verify that the fan rotates freely.\nBut there are even more issues. Have a look at all of them:\nDoes your Vornado Heater not turn on? If your Vornado space heater doesn’t turn on, the issue must be somewhere between the heater’s built-in power circuitry and your home’s electric circuitry.\nThat’s obvious. So, let’s start with the simplest-to-check causes first.\nUnpowered wall outlet The simplest possible cause of your Vornado heater not turning on is that the wall outlet is not powered.\nSo, the issue is outside of the heater.\nThe quickest way to check this is to plug your heater into another wall outlet and see if it turns on there. You can cross-check this by plugging another device into the supposedly broken wall outlet and see if it runs.\nUsually, the cause for an unpowered wall outlet is a blown fuse or a tripped circuit breaker.\nCheck your home’s electric service box and check that the fuses are intact and circuit breakers are switched to the right position.\nIf a fuse looks blown, replace it with an equivalent replacement fuse. If any of the circuit breakers is triggered, switch it back.\nThen, first test the wall outlet with another low-power device (such as your phone charger). It should work now.\nAfter that, plug in and turn on your Vornado heater. If it doesn’t work, check the electric service box again. If a fuse blew again or a circuit breaker tripped again, then your Vornado heater draws too much current for your home’s circuit, or too many devices (TV, fridge, etc.) run simultaneously.\nYou can check with an electrician whether it’s possible to install higher current fuses or circuit breakers in your home to fix that.\nBroken wall outlet Another possible cause for your Vornado heater not turning on is a broken wall outlet. This can be the case when, due to high current, plastic pieces melt, or metal pieces weld together inside the wall outlet.\nThis is, however, very rare.\nThe simplest way to check this is to try your Vornado heater on another wall outlet.\nIf the fuses and circuit breakers inside your electric service panel look OK, and other devices also don’t work on this wall outlet, you have to replace the outlet.\nBroken power cord Now, we’re getting closer to the heater. If the wall outlet is working fine, then another reason can be the power cord connecting the heater and wall outlet.\nTo check this, you’ll have to unplug the Vornado heater and open its case until you have access to the power electronics. Then, turn it back on.\nBe careful, since you can get zapped now.\nUsing a multimeter (or any other device to check voltages), check whether you can measure a voltage where the power cord and the circuit board connect.\nIf there is no voltage, then your Vornado heater’s power cord is likely broken. Technically, there can also be a short circuit somewhere.\nYou can eliminate this possible cause by unsoldering (or unplugging, depending on the space heater model) the power cord and measuring the voltage on the power cord’s end only.\nReplace the power cord with another one that can carry 15 Amps of current. For most Vorndato heaters, this heavy-duty cord (click here to view it on amazon) should be good.\nYou have to cut the female end off, strip the wires, and solder them to your Vornado heater’s circuitry.\nLoose contacts or disconnected ON-OFF switch In some Vornado heaters, the ON-OFF power switch uses connectors for the power cord wires that can fall off.\nSo, open your Vornado heater and check that none of the power cord wires sits loosely on its connector.\nAnd, make sure that there is no connector without a wire attached, which would mean that a wire is hanging around freely inside your Vornado heater’s case.\nThis is the most common cause for a Vornado power switch not working.\nTechnically, the switch itself can also be defective, although that happens rarely.\nYou can check this by measuring the voltages on both ends of the power switch. Do the voltages on either end change when you switch the power switch ON and OFF?\nIf yes, then the power switch is broken and you have to replace it.\nThis is going to be ugly since I doubt that Vorndado provides these replacement parts. So, you’ll have to use a generic power switch, which doesn’t really fit.\nYou can make it fit by adjusting the hole size of the power switch. But that requires tinkering and crafting.\nYou can find generic replacement power switches online or in a hardware store. They come in different sizes and shapes. So, get the one that most closely resembles the original switch!\nCheck the connectors below the power switch panel!\nDoes the light / display turn on? When a light or display on your Vornado turns on, but both the fan and the heater don’t work, the power supply to your heater is fine, but there is an issue inside your heater.\nHere are the possible causes.\nFan stuck One possible cause is that the fan inside your Vornado heater is stuck. This could be either due to broken bearings (which is unlikely), a broken fan blade or something else blocking the fan.\nTo check for a stuck fan, open your Vornado heater’s case. Try to rotate the fan manually.\nDoes it rotate easily or not? Do the fan blades look okay? And is something stuck in between the blades?\nBlocked fans or broken fan blades can happen when you have kids at home. They experiment with the heater and put sticks into the Vornado’s fan.\nIn any case, you have to remove anything that blocks the fan’s rotation. If you find that your Vornado heater fan is broken, replace the entire fan, or just the fan blades.\nI found replacement fan parts for Vornado heaters online on aliexpress.com (takes a few weeks shipping time from China) and used replacement parts from someone’s disassembly on eBay.\nWhile you’re at it, lubricate the fan to improve the rotation. For this, you can use any lubricant. I use WD-40.\nFan not turned on This one is obvious. I just want to mention it for completeness. Some Vornado space heaters have separate turn-on switches for the heater and fan.\nMake sure that the fan-switch is turned on (if there is one on your heater).\nDoes the fan turn on but it doesn’t blow hot air? Now, we get to more interesting territory: Your Vornado space heater turns on but blows only cold air.\nThis is a case where your heater works partly. So, the potential cause can be a bit trickier to find.\nOne thing we can eliminate is your fan and the power supply. Since the fan rotates, it’s working fine.\nBroken or blown electronic parts There are different kinds of electronic problems, such as thermostat or sensor issues. But usually, they all reduce to the same base problem: A broken part in the electronics.\nOftentimes you don’t even have to know what the part is that you are repairing. For example, a blown capacitor is a blown capacitor. It doesn’t matter whether it’s part of the power module or the thermostat.\nSo, my suggestion is to visually inspect your Vornado heater. To do that, open its case until you find a circuit board.\nSome Vornado heaters have only very basic circuitry and there’s not much to see. Other Vornado models have more complex circuitry.\nIn any case, inspect the circuitry visually for 5 minutes. Don’t do anything else. Just stare at the circuit board and all its connections.\nWhen I worked in an electronics repair department, this was the go-to troubleshooting method.\nStaring at electronic circuitry for a few minutes reveals, I’d say, 80% of the issues. And you don’t even have to measure anything.\nLook out for burn marks, blown parts, and capacitors that look deformed. If there are integrated circuits (ICs) on your circuit board, check that all the pins are connected to the circuit board.\nSometimes, pins hover over the soldering joint without making a physical connection.\nI’ve also seen this with surface-mounted resistors, where one end was hovering above the solder joint only a tiny fraction of a millimeter. You could barely see it with a magnifying glass.\nIf you spot a broken or disconnected part, you need a soldering iron to replace it. One exception are parts that have connectors you merely reconnect. This can be fuses or the connectors of the ON-OFF switch.\nSo, replace any broken parts you find with equivalent replacement parts you get online or from a hardware store.\nIf you can’t find any issues by visual inspection, trace the voltage from the power cord until you see it drop.\nThen check the area in the vicinity of the voltage drop. Something must be off there.\nOftentimes you can spot issues right on the electric power module (which looks similar to this picture, with big copper coils, capacitors, and a transformer).\nDoes the heater turn off after some time? Technically, the most interesting issues in space heaters are those with what I call “charging effects”.\nCharging effects are all those issues that only occur after running your space heater for a few seconds or minutes.\nIt seems like the issue has to charge for some time until it reaches a threshold and then “breaks out” and causes the heater to shut off.\nI’d even say that most space heater issues are charging issues. And they are among the simplest to fix:\nOverheat protection triggered The most common cause for your Vornado heater shutting off after a few seconds or minutes of heating is the overheat protection triggering.\nWhenever there is an issue that takes time to occur, it is oftentimes due to heat building up.\nYou turn your heater on, heat accumulates, and then it triggers the overheat protection.\nWhen overheat protection triggers like this, it’s almost certainly due to dust inside the heater.\nLuckily, it is easy to fix:\nOpen your Vornado heater’s case and remove all the dust. To remove the dust, you can use your bare hands and remove the large dust balls manually. Then, for the fine-grained parts use a dry toothbrush.\nAlternatively, you can blow out the dust using a compressed air gun.\nHere, it is important to only use dry methods to clean your Vornado heater. Using wet cleaners or water to clean the dust will result in an annoying smell that you can’t get rid of.\nOnly if there’s grease on your fan blades, you can sprinkle some cleaning products or rubbing alcohol to dissolve the fat and remove it more easily.\nThen, reassemble your Vornado heater and run it. I bet it works now!\n95% of heaters shutting off after some time are just full of dust.\nElectric charging effects There is a tiny chance your Vornado heater shuts off after some time due to other kinds of charging effects. This could be an overloading capacitor or a resistor overheating and changing its electrical characteristics.\nThese issues are, however, very rare.\nThe easiest way to check them is to open your Vornado heater and turn it on. See if you hear a noise building up (screeching, buzzing, or similar). And check for parts getting hot and giving off smoke right before your heater shuts off.\nIf this happens, replace the affected parts and retry.\nWhat to do if your Vornado heater still doesn’t work? If you are not able to repair your Vornado heater, even after following this guide, I’d recommend getting a new space heater.\nInstead of getting another Vornado heater (which might break again), I recommend changing the heater type entirely.\nVornado heaters have built-in fans, which cause dust to accumulate. Also, they wear down due to friction. So, it’s just a matter of time until it breaks.\nInstead, get a heater that does not accumulate dust and has no moving parts, such as an oil-filled radiator.\nBecause nothing moves, and there is no airflow inside an oil-filled radiator, it will easily last for 10 years or more. Oil-filled radiators are the most reliable heaters.\nI recommend getting this DeLonghi oil-filled radiator(click here to view it on amazon). This heater produces just the same amount of heat as any Vornado heater, without the downside of breaking easily.\nI’d prefer an oil-filled radiator over a Vornado heater anytime.\nAlso, sell your broken heater online. Someone will buy it. There are hundreds of people happily buying, repairing, and flipping broken devices.\nBy selling it, you save yourself all the repair trouble. And someone else can make a profit on your heater.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-a-vornado-heater-not-working/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour Vornado Heater is not working and you don’t know why?

Unfortunately, they don’t exist.\nIn this article, I am going to explain to you why you can’t find a vented propane heater that does not use electricity (for off-grid heating) anywhere.\nAnd then, we’re going to check what you can do about it. Freezing is not an option!\nQuick answer: Vented propane heaters always need electricity to power their built-in fan which blows waste gases through the vent. Propane heaters that don’t require electricity to run are always ventless. The best ventless propane heater without electricity is a Mr. Heater Buddy heater or a wall-mounted Dyna Glo propane heater.\nWhy vented propane heaters always use electricity Vented propane heaters always need electricity to power the built-in fan that blows waste gases out through the vent.\nAdditionally, they usually have a built-in electric thermostat, and some have electric safety mechanisms such as overheat protection.\nHowever, the fan blowing gases out through the vent makes electricity necessary.\nPersonally, I think it would be totally feasible to build non-electric vented gas heaters. Just like wood stoves, you could burn the heat source, which in turn is vented through a chimney.\nAnd probably that’s the point.\nWithout electricity, you need a chimney, which creates suction through the stack effect.\nAnd if you already have a chimney at home, or in your cabin, why should you use a vented propane heater over a wood stove?\nSo, that seems to be the logic:\nToxic waste gases need a vent For suction through the vent, you need either an electric fan or a chimney In the first case, you already have electricity at home. And if you have a chimney, you might as well use a wood stove. So:\nVented propane heaters that work without electricity don’t exist because there is no market for them.\nHow can you heat without electricity instead? There are three ways you can work around this problem. All of them involve tradeoffs.\nVentless propane heater All propane heaters that work without electricity are ventless. Ventless propane heaters are perfectly safe for indoor usage.\nAnd, as long as you use a ventless heater properly, there is no reason to prefer a vented heater over a ventless heater.\nMy favorite ventless propane heater is this Mr. Heater Big Buddy propane heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nThe Mr. Heater Big Buddy provides up to 18,000 BTU/h of heating power. That’s more than enough to keep even large rooms warm in winter.\nAnd, of course, you can also heat uninsulated off-grid places with the Mr. Heater Big Buddy.\nEven though it’s a portable heater, you can connect it to large propane tanks. So, you won’t ever run into a gas shortage.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Buddy is a ventless propane heater that does not need electricity.\nSo, the only drawback in comparison with your vented off-grid heater (which does not exist), is that you have to vent your room occasionally.\nPropane combustion creates water vapor and (if your room lacks oxygen) potentially carbon monoxide. By opening the window every couple of hours for a few minutes you reduce the risk of toxic gas emissions to zero.\nThere were experiments where RV owners ran the Mr. Heater portable heater overnight in a fully sealed RV and it did not emit any toxic carbon monoxide.\nMr. Heater propane heaters are very safe. So, if safety was your reason to get a direct-vent heater, you don’t have to worry about running a Mr. Heater.\nPortable propane heaters are my first recommendation because they are very safe. As long as you use them responsibly, they are just as safe as any other heater.\nAlternatively, if you need more heating power than that, I recommend getting this 30,000 BTU Dyna Glo wall-mounted ventless propane heater(click here to view it on amazon).\nThe Dyna Glo is a great ventless propane heater if you are looking for a long-term heating solution.\nSince you can wall-mount it, it doesn’t take up floor space. The only downside is that it’s not really portable due to its size.\nWood stove The best way to heat a room without electricity is a wood stove.\nWood stoves never emit toxic gases since they are vented (through the chimney).\nAnd wood is incredibly cost-effective. You can estimate that the long term cost of a wood stove is about a third of that of a propane heater, assuming that both heaters produce the same heat.\nThat’s because the cost per BTU of heat of wood is about a third when compared to propane.\nSo, wood stoves are objectively the cheapest way to heat.\nFun fact: A wood stove is essentially a vented gas heater that does not use electricity. Because the fire that is produced in a wood stove is essentially burning gas coming from the wood.\nAnyways, the downside of running a wood stove is that preparing wood is more work than propane.\nAnd wood stoves need installation.\nFor occasional heating in an off-grid cabin, garage, basement or shed I’d still recommend using a ventless propane heater.\nVented propane heater (that needs electricity) plus generator The only true way to have a vented propane heater in a place without electricity is to get a vented propane heater and power it off a generator (or any other electricity source).\nVented propane heaters don’t use a lot of electricity, because the main energy source is still propane. You can estimate about 100W.\nSo, you can also use a weaker electricity source such as a solar panel, charge a battery with it, and connect the battery with an inverter to produce the AC voltage your vented propane heater needs.\nThe problem with this approach is obvious: Off-grid electricity generators are expensive.\nAnd so are solar panels and inverters.\nAnd on top of that, they are heavy and take up lots of space, and are hardly portable.\nAlso, for just 100W of power that a vented propane heater needs, generators, and solar panels as electricity sources are completely unjustified.\nMy recommendation:\nIf you already have a fuel-based (or even better: a propane-based) generator at home, then you can hook it up with a vented propane heater and heat your room.\nHowever, getting a new generator merely for powering a propane heater is not really feasible.\nConclusion Unfortunately, there is no vented propane heater that does not use electricity. To heat off-grid places, I recommend using a ventless propane heater instead.\nPersonally, I prefer portable propane heaters such as the Mr. Heater Buddy models.\nBut you can get any propane heater you like. They all work roughly the same.\nVentless propane heaters don’t need any electricity to run and are the simplest option for off-grid heating.\nThey don’t need any installation or ductwork.\nAlternatively, if you need a long-term heating solution, I recommend getting a wood stove.\nWood stoves are time-tested. There is a reason humans use them for thousands of years already.\nWood stoves heat throughout electricity outages. And you don’t depend on gas suppliers.\nIn emergency situations, you can go to the woods and chop your own wood.\nWood stoves are the only true emergency off-grid heat source.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-vented-propane-heater-without-electricity/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou are looking for a vented propane heater that does not use electricity?

Depending on how much you use your propane tank, the tank can empty in one day, or in a month.\nIn this article, we’re going to check all the different possible durations. You just have to look up your heater’s heating power (in BTU per hour).\nQuick answer: A 20lb propane tank lasts for 38 hours of heating on a regular 9,000 BTU portable propane heater. On larger heaters (30,000 to 60,000 BTU) it lasts between 6 and 12 hours.\nHow much propane is in a 20lb propane tank? A 20lb propane tank contains 16lb of propane gas because it is only filled up to 80% of its capacity.\nPropane tanks are generally filled to 80% of their capacity because propane is very temperature sensitive.\nWith each degree of temperature increase, propane expands 17 times more than air.\nSo, if you fill a propane tank to 100% of its capacity, the internal pressure varies strongly with the outside temperature.\nA propane tank that’s only 80% full has enough room for the propane to contract and expand.\nHow much energy is in a 20lb propane tank? Before we can calculate how long a 20lb propane tank lasts, we have to know how much heat energy a 20 pounder contains.\nThis is important because the propane consumption of propane heaters is typically not specified in pounds of propane gas per hour, but in terms of heat energy per hour.\nOne pound (lb) of propane contains 21,594 BTU of heat energy. And a propane tank is filled to 80% of its capacity.\nA 20lb propane tank, therefore, contains 345,552 BTU of heat energy.\n20 lb × 21,594 BTU per lb × 80% = 345,552 BTU\nHow much energy do different propane heaters use? Now that you know how much heat energy is stored in a propane tank, let’s check different propane heaters and how much heat energy they consume per hour.\nTypically, regular portable indoor propane heaters consume 9,000 BTU - 18,000 BTU per hour.\nExamples are my all-time favorite portable propane heaters, the Mr. Heater Buddy (9,000 BTU) and the Mr. Heater Big Buddy (18,000 BTU) (click here to view my review).\nThen, larger propane heaters, such as wall- or ceiling-mounted gas heaters or patio heaters consume between 30,000 BTU/h and 55,000 BTU/h.\nOf course, there are always exceptions. Some ceiling-mounted propane heaters go up to 80,000 BTU/h or 120,000 BTU/h.\nAnd then, there are also industrial torpedo heaters which consume up to 130,000 BTU/h.\nA regular indoor propane heater on moderate settings consumes 10,000 BTU/h. A strong outdoor patio heater consumes 45,000 BTU/h.\nHow long will a 20 lb propane tank last for regular everyday usage? So, let’s have a look at how long different heater sizes last on a 20lb propane tank.\nThe calculation follows the formula:\nTank capacity (in hours) = Propane tank capacity (in BTU) ÷ Heating power (in BTU/h)\nwhere the propane tank capacity is 345,552 BTU, which we calculated earlier.\n**Heating power (in BTU/h)****Tank capacity (in hours)**3,000 BTU/h115 hours6,000 BTU/h58 hours9,000 BTU/h38 hours12,000 BTU/h29 hours15,000 BTU/h23 hours18,000 BTU/h19 hours21,000 BTU/h16 hours24,000 BTU/h14 hours27,000 BTU/h13 hours30,000 BTU/h12 hours33,000 BTU/h10 hours36,000 BTU/h10 hours39,000 BTU/h9 hours42,000 BTU/h8 hours45,000 BTU/h8 hours48,000 BTU/h7 hours51,000 BTU/h7 hours54,000 BTU/h6 hours57,000 BTU/h6 hours60,000 BTU/h6 hours70,000 BTU/h5 hours80,000 BTU/h4 hours90,000 BTU/h4 hours100,000 BTU/h3 hours110,000 BTU/h3 hours120,000 BTU/h3 hours130,000 BTU/h3 hours\nAccording to the calculations:\nA regular indoor propane heater lasts 38 to 115 hours, depending on the heat settings. A patio heater lasts for 6 to 9 hours of heating on a 20lb propane tank. Industrial-grade heaters last for only 3-4 hours on a 20lb propane tank. You should use them with larger tanks instead. How long does a heater last on a 20lb propane tank (depending on daily heating duration)? The results from the table above show how long you can run different heaters on a 20lb continuously.\nA regular portable propane heater or indoor heater, according to the table lasts anywhere between 32 hours and 115 hours.\nHowever, you never run a propane heater continuously.\nSo, how long would a regular heater last on a 20lb propane tank realistically?\nHere’s a table with how long a regular indoor heater hot enough to keep a large living room warm (9,000 BTU), lasts on a 20lb propane tank realistically, depending on how much you use the heater.\n**Daily heating duration (in hours)****How long does a 20lb propane tank last? (with a 9,000 BTU/h heater)**2 hours19 days4 hours10 days6 hours6 days8 hours5 days10 hours4 days12 hours3 days14 hours3 days\nA 20lb propane tank lasts for a week of heating if you use it for 4-6 hours a day.\nIf you use your heater as the main heat source and you use it for 12 hours a day, a 20lb propane tank lasts you 3 days.\nHow to ensure your tank lasts as long as possible Now that you know how long your propane tank lasts, let’s have a quick look at how you can maximize the heating duration you get from your tank.\nFirst, the propane consumption is directly proportional to the heat setting you choose.\nSo, if you cut the heat setting in half, the propane consumption halves as well, which, in turn, doubles the heating duration.\nMy propane heater has two heat settings: 4,500 BTU and 9,000 BTU. I run my propane heater on the lower setting. And it’s still hot enough to keep me warm all the time!\nAlso, ensure that the gas line and the heater are connected tightly, so no gas leaks.\nAnd, always use a high-quality, weather-proof gas hose such as Gaspro gas hose (click here to view it on amazon).\nNever use an old gas hose, since they can form micro-leaks over time. You won’t notice them, but even if they leak only 0.1% of your propane tank a day, that’s a wasted tank every 3 years!\nCheck out this article: How to fix a propane heater using too much propane (click here) for more propane-saving tips!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-long-does-a-20lb-propane-tank-last/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow long a 20lb propane tank lasts depends on the heater you use with it.

In this article, we’re troubleshooting and fixing your Honeywell space heater using just a few targeted questions.\nThis article covers all of the most-used Honeywell space heaters, including the Honeywell tower space heaters (Slim and HeatGenius) and the smaller Honeywell heaters (the 360-degree and UberHeat).\nDon’t worry if you have a different Honeywell heater. Most Honeywell heaters work just the same internally. So, you can follow this guide regardless!\nFirst off, let’s start with a why. As an engineer and heat-blogger, I am always surprised by the lack of real help you get with technical issues online.\nYou may find a fixing guide here and there, but all the tips are generic and not really helpful.\nHere’s one example from Honeywell:\n\u0026ldquo;Try unplugging the unit and leaving it unplugged for about 20 minutes. This should reset the unit.”\nthe official Honeywell website \u0026hellip; not very helpful\nThat’s the poorest kind of advice. In my entire life, I’ve never fixed any power electronics (such as heaters) by “reset”. In the end, heaters are very simple devices. There is nothing to reset in them.\nResets only help with more complex devices such as computers.\nThat’s the advice you get from the manufacturer. There is no explanation, no troubleshooting, nothing.\nIt seems like they just want to sell you another heater.\nAnyways, let’s try to get your Honeywell heater working again. But with some real troubleshooting!\nHow to fix a Honeywell space heater not working There are different forms of a heater not working. Some heaters might not turn on at all. Others might turn on, but not blow any hot air.\nI’ve got you covered with troubleshooting and fixing tips for all of these scenarios.\nQuick answer: To fix your Honeywell heater not working, open its case and clean out all of the dust. Also, plug it in another wall outlet to eliminate a defective wall outlet as a possible cause. If it still doesn’t work, visually inspect the electronic circuitry and replace all burned parts.\nHave a look at the questions below to find your specific issue:\nDoes the heater turn on? Your heater is plugged into the wall outlet but doesn’t even turn on? If a device doesn’t turn on, the issue is always somewhere in the power chain: fuses \u0026amp; circuit breakers, wall outlet, power cord, or the electric power circuit board inside your Honeywell heater.\nLet’s have a look at the simplest causes first.\nCheck for a blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker Fuses and circuit breakers are safety mechanisms. When devices draw too much power from your home’s electric circuit, fuses and circuit breakers interrupt the power supply in order to stop overheating, cable meltdown, and in the worst case, a house fire.\nHoneywell heaters always draw 1,500 Watts. Any home should be able to handle a single 1,500W unit.\nBut, for instance, running your Honeywell heater along with a computer and a TV can be too much for your circuit and blow a fuse.\nTo fix a blown fuse or a tripped circuit breaker, go to your home’s electric service panel. There, you see a bunch of circuit breaker switches (in newer homes) or fuses (in older homes).\nCheck whether any of the switches or fuses are triggered.\nThen, reset the circuit breaker switch. If you find a blown fuse, replace it with a matching fuse. You can find them in hardware stores or online.\nCheck for a defective wall outlet A possible, but unlikely issue is a broken wall outlet. Even though broken wall outlets are rare, I list them here for completeness. I want you to be able to troubleshoot any issue with your space heater!\nA broken wall outlet is very easy to troubleshoot. Just take your Honeywell heater to another wall outlet and try to run it there.\nIf it works on another outlet, then the space heater works and the issue is your wall outlet.\nReplace it!\nAnd in the meantime, run your Honeywell heater off another wall outlet.\nFix the broken power cord The power cord that connects your heater to the wall outlet might have a loose connection.\nAnd now, we’re at a point where you have to open your Honeywell space heater for the first time!\nTo check whether your Honeywell space heater receives power from the wall outlet, open its case until you see the power electronics.\nMany Honeywell heaters open from the bottom side. Depending on the model, you might have to open the backside.\nOn the electric circuit board, there should be contacts where your power cord connects to. Use a voltmeter, a multimeter, or any other measurement tool to check whether you have any voltage there.\nIf you don’t have any voltage where the power cord connects to the circuitry, the issue is likely a loose contact in the power cord.\nTo fix it, replace your Honeywell heater’s power cord. If you’re good at soldering, this should be no problem.\nAnd, I’d say this is a great opportunity to get into soldering for the first time!\nIf you use your Honeywell heater with an extension cord, get a proper heavy-duty extension cord for space heaters.\nInspect the electric power circuitry If none of the previous causes (fuses, circuit breakers, wall outlet, power cord) was the cause for your Honeywell space heater not turning on at all, there’s just one more possible reason: An issue in the power electronics.\nTo troubleshoot power electronics, always start with a visual inspection. Just have a look at the electronic circuit board sitting inside your Honeywell space heater.\nInspect the circuit board for blown or broken parts. There may be a burned resistor or a capacitor with burn marks around it.\nTake at least 5 minutes to carefully inspect the entire circuit board. Sometimes, it takes a few minutes of staring until you see the issue.\nIf you can’t find any out-of-place-looking parts, then use a multimeter to trace voltages. Start from the connection point of the power cord and follow the voltage until you find the voltage drop.\nReplace the part that causes the voltage drop. In some cases, the voltage drop may be caused by nearby parts.\nYou can double-check this by unsoldering the broken part and checking the circuit’s voltage.\nIn any case, to fix broken power electronics, you need soldering skills and you have to know the broken part.\nUnfortunately, Honeywell doesn’t sell any electronic circuit replacement parts. But any brand’s replacement parts will do as long as you get the right specifications.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what the power module in most space heaters looks like. Usually, they have large cylindrical capacitors and one or multiple transformers (yellow).\nDoes the light / display turn on? In this section, we’re covering potential causes of your Honeywell space heater turning on, but not doing anything. Only a light or a display turns on.\nBut neither the heating nor the fan activates.\nClean or replace the clogged air filter The likeliest reason for the power light or display turning on, but not the heating, is that the air filter inside your Honeywell space heater is clogged.\nNot all space heaters have built-in air filters. But most heaters that blow air have one.\nWhen the air filter is clogged, two things happen:\nYour fan has to exert a much larger force to blow air. So, it rotates slowly and with much higher friction. As a result, it does not blow any air.\nThe other thing that can happen is that dust accumulates to a point where it reaches the fan blades and blocks the fan from rotating.\nYour Honeywell heater activates the fan’s power supply and thinks it is rotating. But actually, nothing happens.\nFixing clogged air filters is easy. Open your Honeywell space heater’s case and take out all of the internal components until you can access the air filters.\nThe best solution is to replace the air filter entirely. If you can’t find fitting air filters, you can cut any regular air filter to size and then tape it inside your heater.\nI know this is not the kind of neat advice you expect. But it’s what works!\nAlternatively, you can clean your clogged air filters with a dry toothbrush. Do not use water to clean air filters. Filters are full of dust. In combination with water, they are a breeding ground for bacteria.\nYou’ll never get rid of the smell.\nSo, only dry brush dirty air filters.\nInsert the air filter in your Honeywell space heater again. Your heater should work now!\nReset the triggered overheat protection Many Honeywell space heaters have built-in overheat protection. Many space heaters from other brands rely on digital overheat protection. That’s basically a thermometer that monitors the temperature. And if it rises above a certain threshold, the thermostat cuts down the heating.\nHowever, when the electric controls fail during an overheating, there’s nothing to stop the overheating.\nSo, Honeywell designed a mechanical overheat protection, which always works, even without electricity.\nThe mechanical overheat protection is a simple sheet metal contact in the side of the heater’s case, next to the air filter.\nWhen your heater overheats, the heat-sensitive metal sheet deforms and opens the circuit, which cuts off the power supply.\nI like it a lot, actually. Honeywell’s overheat protection is both simple and safe.\nBut there’s one disadvantage: The bent metal sheet does not move back into place when the heater cools down again.\nAnother problem is that the contacts can deform without overheating, for example when the heater tips over.\nThe overheat protection is the small copper piece sitting aside the air filter. In the image it\u0026rsquo;s on the top right side of the air filter.\nHere’s how to fix it.\nOpen your heater and check the inside of the case next to the air filter. There should be a copper-colored contact.\nWhen this contact is open (meaning one metal sheet doesn’t touch the other), your heater can’t receive power.\nPress the contact down, so both metal pieces touch. Then, try to run your Honeywell heater again. It should work now.\nTheoretically, you can force the two metal contacts together with tape or a metal clip. But I recommend trying without since this would break the overheat protection.\nBy the way:\n“Don’t test your Honeywell space heater fixes when your heater is lying on its side. The tip-over protection is active. Honeywell heaters only turn on when they’re upright.”\nDoes the heater blow only cold air? In this section, we’re figuring out what to do when your Honeywell heater turns on but blows only cold air.\nTest for a broken thermometer Honeywell space heaters have a built-in thermostat. A thermostat is a temperature control device.\nDepending on your room’s temperature, it activates or disables the heating.\nSo, it has to read your room temperature from a thermometer sitting inside your Honeywell space heater.\nUsually, this thermometer sits in the bottom part of the case where it is not exposed to heat (since heat always rises up).\nIf the thermometer in your Honeywell space heater is broken and reads false or no temperatures, your heater won’t activate the heating element.\nIf your heater has a display with a temperature reading, then the thermometer is easy to test.\nOpen the bottom part of the case and locate the thermometer component. It’s a small circuit board (under 1 inch × 1 inch).\nTouch it and see if the temperature displayed changes. If it doesn’t change, then the thermometer is broken.\nInspect the thermometer closely. See if all the wires are connected properly and if there are any blown parts.\nYou might be able to fix it without replacement if there is just a broken connection.\nIn any other case, replace the entire thermometer. Check the serial number on the electronic part and find a fitting replacement!\nDoes the Honeywell space heater shut off after a few seconds of running? If your Honeywell space heater shuts off after turning it on, this can technically have only one explanation:\nSomething inside loads, charges or heats up, which takes time. Then, once this part reaches a certain threshold, the heater shuts off on its own.\nHere are the possible reasons, with the likeliest first:\nClean dusty internal components When your Honeywell space heater is filled with dust internally, it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of time until it overheats.\nWhen you turn on your heater, it works just fine. But after a few seconds or minutes, it stops blowing hot air.\nThe dust insulates the heater and accumulates a lot of heat. It’s like running your heater while it’s wrapped in a down blanket.\nThis can trigger the overheat protection and it can build up electric resistance in the circuitry, which can cause parts to fail.\nSo, open your heater and clean out all the dust that accumulated inside!\n“Went and blew out the dust and dog hair and [my Honeywell space heater] works fine now!”\nyoutube comment\nTechnically, any other thing with a charging effect can cause a Honeywell space heater to shut off after some time.\nThe following two causes are rare and harder to fix. So, focus on cleaning your Honeywell space heater thoroughly before.\nCheck electronics for overcharged capacitors Capacitors are electrical components that charge and discharge. If there is a fault in the electronic circuitry, it can cause a capacitor to overcharge. And once the voltage reaches a certain threshold, it causes your space heater to shut off.\nDepending on the capacitor’s capacity and the input voltage, it might cut the heater off after a few seconds or after minutes.\nTo check for this issue you can open your Honeywell space heater’s case, and measure capacitor voltages on the circuit board.\nThere may be one capacitor where the voltage rises without stopping. Now, the issue is usually not the capacitor itself, but a part in its vicinity.\nVisually inspect the circuit board for burn marks and broken pieces.\nIf you find a broken part, replace it using your soldering skills.\nCheck for a mechanical defect Technically, even mechanical issues can have these charging effects, where the failure takes time to show up.\nThis is the case when parts change their shape due to heat or other forces.\nFor example, it might be that broken bearings in your heater’s fan work fine as long as they are cold.\nBut once they heat up above a certain temperature, they deform and block the fan’s rotational movement.\nSuch mechanical defects are rare. So, again, focus on checking the dust and the capacitors in your heater before you check for other mechanical defects.\nTo fix a mechanical defect, find out where it comes from. Usually, these defects make a noise, so they are simple to locate.\nThen, replace the defective part.\nWhat if you can’t fix your Honeywell heater? The issues and fixes covered in this article cover all common space heater issues. In case you can’t find a solution for your specific issue, or you can’t perform the fix (because you need a soldering iron and electronic skills), here’s my philosophy:\nBuy yourself the relief of a new space heater.\nDon’t worry about fixing your broken heater if you don’t have the time or the knowledge to do it.\nI personally recommend getting this DeLonghi oil-filled radiator (click here to view it on amazon) over another Honeywell heater.\nThe biggest difference is that oil-filled radiators have a heating element fully embedded in an oil-filled metal body.\nSo, the oil always wicks away heat from the heating element.\nOil-filled radiators, therefore, have no overheating effects. And you never have to deal with overheat-related repairs, such as deformed parts or triggered overheat protection.\nMeanwhile, instead of trying to repair your Honeywell heater, you can sell it online (labeled as defective of course).\nMany people fix and flip products as a hobby. So, selling your broken heater frees you from the burden of fixing it and you make someone else a small profit. It’s a win-win situation!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-a-honeywell-space-heater-not-working/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour Honeywell space heater is not working?

When I looked for the best vented gas heaters online, I found only bogus results.\nAlmost every article recommended heaters that looked like vented gas heaters but were actually ventless. Heck, even Walmart fails to differentiate between ventless and vented gas heaters when you use their search option.\nIn this article, we’re going to check out the best \u0026amp; truly vented gas heaters. Spoiler: There are tons of choices, but only a few are good.\nSo, instead of listing all the heaters that I can think of, I am going to provide you with only the 3 absolute best heaters.\nQuality is better than quantity!\nSo, let’s have a look:\n1. The best: Mr. Heater Big Maxx (50,000 BTU) The best vented gas heater is the Mr. Heater Big Maxx (click here to view it on amazon) in its 50,000 BTU version.\nWith a heat output of 50,000 BTU per hour, it is hot enough to heat even the largest living rooms, garages, basements, and whatever large space you can think of.\nI ranked this heater number one because nothing can beat the quality of the Mr. Heater’s full-metal case, which makes it extra safe and extra durable.\nMetal cases never melt, nor do they ever discolor like plastic. So, the Mr. Heater Big Maxx will look just the same in 10 years as it does now.\nIn contrast to most other heaters, which stand on the floor or are wall-mounted, you can mount the Mr. Heater Big Maxx to your ceiling.\nThere it takes up no space.\nSo, it is perfect for rooms where you don’t have much space left to install a heater.\nAnd, additionally, the Mr. Heater Big Maxx is the absolute safest propane heater (Yup, it even won this award on heatertips.com).\nFirst and foremost, it comes with all the safety features you need, including overheat protection and a built-in fan that prevents heat buildup inside the heater.\nBut since you can ceiling-mount the Mr. Heater Big Maxx, it is a perfect choice if you have kids or pets at home.\nThe heater is completely out of reach for them.\nI’d say the Mr. Heater Big Maxx is best for any indoor spaces in single-family homes, including living rooms, garages, and wood workshops.\nHeat output50,000 BTUCompatible gasNatural gas (default) and propane (conversion kit included)Best forLarge living rooms, garages, workshops, and basementsMount-typeCan be mounted to the ceiling, so it takes up no space\n2. The big brother: Mr. Heater Big Maxx (80,000 BTU) The Mr. Heater Big Maxx comes also in larger variants including its 80,000 BTU version(click here to view it on amazon).\nThere’s also an even bigger Big Maxx heater but that one is better for industrial applications.\nYou should get the 80,000 BTU Big Maxx over the 50,000 BTU version for heating large \u0026amp; uninsulated spaces.\nSo, get the 80,000 BTU Mr. Heater Big Maxx for your uninsulated garage, your uninsulated wood workshop, or your uninsulated living room (eg. in a cabin).\nIt’s also a great choice for old buildings with heavy, solid, and cold stone walls. These tend to absorb a lot of heat and increase the heat-up time of your house a lot.\nYou can circumvent this using the 80,000 BTU Big Maxx.\nI intentionally placed the Big Maxx models rank 1 and 2 to make clear that to this day I did not meet a gas-based heater that beats the quality of Mr. Heater.\nFor most people, the “small” 50,000 BTU version is more than enough.\nHeat output80,000 BTUCompatible gasNatural gas (default) and propane (conversion kit included)Best forLarge uninsulated living rooms, garages, workshops, and basementsMount-typeCan be mounted to the ceiling, so it takes up no space\n3. Best for living rooms: Rinnai EX22CTWP (20,700 BTU) This 20,700 BTU Rinnai Direct-Vent Propane Heater(click here to view it on amazon) is the best vented propane heater for most indoor spaces, such as living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, etc.\nIn comparison to the previous two heaters (the Big Maxx models), the Rinnai direct-vent propane heater looks a lot less bulky and integrates better with most living rooms.\nIt looks just like a regular heater.\nOf course, it comes with the necessary safety mechanisms such as overheat protection and a built-in thermostat.\nWhat I like most about the Rinnai heater is the automatic restart in case the combustion fails.\nMost propane heaters monitor their combustion with a so-called pilot light. That’s a small gas flame that is branched off the main gas line. A thermocouple (which is a specific form of thermometer) then measures the temperature of the pilot light flame.\nIf the flame is hot, then the heater opens the main gas line. Because a hot pilot light flame indicates that everything works fine.\nHowever, if the pilot light flame is too cool, the heater automatically closes the main gas line. A too-cool gas flame indicates incomplete burn which protects you both from wasting money (because the gas doesn’t produce enough heat), and from carbon monoxide production.\nThe special thing about the Rinnai heater is that it tries to restart the flame ignition in this case.\nWith most other propane heaters, you have to restart the ignition manually.\nThe only downside of the Rinnai heater is the case material (which is plastic). Over time, plastic always degrades. Whether it is through spots that overheat and melt or through discoloring.\nStill, it is a great direct-vent heater. In fact, the Rinnai heater is the best free-standing or wall-mounted direct-vent heater.\nHeat output20,700 BTUCompatible gasPropane gasBest forRegular-sized living rooms, insulated garages, workshops and basementsMount-typeWall-mounted or free-standing\nCan you run vented gas heaters without electricity? No, you can’t run a vented gas heater without electricity. None of the heaters recommended above work without electricity. So, you can’t use them as backup heat sources during an electricity outage (unless you have a generator).\nVented gas heaters are intended to replace a central heating system. Manufacturers design them to output a lot of heat while still remaining safe.\nDesigning a safe, but very hot heater is almost impossible without electronics. Electronics are what make these heaters affordable.\nTo safely control such strong gas heaters, they need at least one of two things:\na thermostat that controls the heat output a built-in fan to blow the heat into the room, protecting the heater from overheating Both of these features need electricity.\nDirect-vent heaters don’t work without electricity. So, you can’t light a vented gas heater during an electricity outage.\nIf you are looking for a heater to rely on during outages, you have to get a ventless heater.\nCheck out the best ventless propane heater here: My favorite propane heater\nWhen to pick a vented gas heater over a ventless heater? Ventless heaters are abundant. There are dozens if not hundreds of good heaters, most of them without any vents.\nSo, in which case should you prefer the vented heaters recommended in this article over a ventless heater?\nIn general, vented gas heaters are best when you need a strong heat source that can safely keep an entire house warm. Vented heaters can replace a central heating system.\nHigh heat output Usually, direct-vent heaters are significantly stronger than ventless gas heaters. For the same price, you usually get double the heat output.\nSome vented heaters (such as the ones recommended at the beginning of this article) get hot enough to replace your central heating system and keep your entire home warm during winter.\nNo toxic waste gases Since vented heaters are - by definition - vented, it is impossible for them to produce any toxic waste gases.\nAnd even if they produce any, these waste gases go right out the vent.\nSo, toxic heaters are much safer to run continuously for long times, without having to open the windows regularly.\nNo water vapor Also, propane gas (if you pick a vented propane heater) produces water vapor during the combustion. This increases your room’s humidity.\nWith a vented heater, the water vapor leaves through the vent and doesn’t enter your living space.\nSo, it keeps your room warm and dry. During the cold season, getting any humidity out of a room is very hard, especially if you live in a humid place.\nWith a vented heater you don’t even introduce any additional humidity to your room.\nNo smell Whenever I enter a room with a gas heater, I immediately notice the smell. Even when the heater is not running.\nNatural gas and propane have a very distinct smell. Both natural gas and propane naturally are odorless.\nBut gas companies add a smelling additive for safety reasons.\nVented heaters don’t smell as much.\nTo be honest, I like the smell. But it’s similar to many people liking the smell of a mowed lawn on a summer morning. It smells good. Nobody can explain why. But you also don’t want your living space to smell like that continuously.\nConclusion Vented heaters replace central heaters, while ventless heaters are supplemental heat sources.\nThe best vented gas heaters are the Mr. Heater Big Maxx models and the Rinnai direct-vent heater.\nAll three of them are very solid and high-quality choices that can keep you warm throughout the winter!\nMy personal favorite is the 50,000 BTU Mr. Heater Big Maxx model. It is strong enough to keep your entire house warm, and it has all the safety features you need.\nPlus, you can install it to your ceiling so it does not take up any floor space!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-vented-gas-heaters/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBeing a heating blogger and an electrical engineer, the internet never ceases to disappoint me.

When you have children or pets around, space heaters that are hot to the touch are not an option.\nIn this article, you’re going to learn about space heaters with the lowest possible surface temperature.\nQuick answer: The Dyson Hot + Cool is the best space heater that’s not hot to the touch. The combination of an embedded heating element and a built-in fan that blows heat out of the heater’s body prevents surface overheating. A more cost-effective alternative is a DeLonghi oil-filled radiator, which maximizes its surface area using thermal slots , and, therefore, minimizes the chance of burning your fingers.\nBefore we begin a deep dive, to save you some time, let’s check out the winner of the heatertips.com “Not hot to touch”-award.\nRecommended Heater: Lowest surface temperature (Dyson) The heater with the lowest overall surface temperature, and, therefore, safest to touch is this Dyson Hot + Cool (click here to view it on amazon).\nGenerally, I am very critical of Dyson heaters. They are highly overpriced, they can be noisy(depending on the fan settings), and some of Dyson’s advertising claims are factually wrong.\nHowever, Dyson heaters exceed in safety, especially when it comes to their surface temperature.\nThe one thing that separates a Dyson Hot + Cool from other space heaters is the strong built-in fan in combination with the hidden heating element.\nDue to the hidden heating element inside the case, children and pets can’t access the hot parts of the heater.\nAnd due to the built-in fan, the surface temperature of the heater can’t build up and does not get hotto touch at all.\nTechnically, Dyson heaters are the coolest-to-touch space heaters.\nBut since they are so pricey, let me recommend you a much more cost-effective option.\nCost-effective alternative (DeLonghi) Much more cost-effective than the Dyson Hot + Cool is this DeLonghi TRD40615EBK oil-filled radiator(click here to view it on amazon).\nIt has a maximum surface temperature of 158°F (70°C), which is less than that of other space heaters with the same power output, but more than that of the Dyson.\nFor comparison, one of my infrared heaters has a surface temperature of around 350°F (178°C), which is a lot hotter to touch.\nOil-filled radiators generally have a large metal heating body. The larger the surface area, the colder to the touch a heater is (while still delivering the same overall amount of heat).\nThis DeLonghi oil-filled radiator has a clever thermal slots design, which\nprevents direct touch of the metal heat source and increases the total surface area of the heating body With 1,500W the DeLonghi oil-filled radiator delivers enough heat to keep even larger living rooms at a comfortable temperature during the winter.\nWhich space heaters are the safest to touch? There are many different types of space heaters, including oil-filled radiators, infrared heaters, ceramic heaters, propane heaters in many more.\nInstead of listing every possible heater and telling you why this specific type is too hot to touch, let me conceptualize something for you.\nWhat makes a space heater (not) hot to the touch? Most electric space heaters consume 1,500W. According to the laws of thermodynamics, all this electric power eventually ends up as heat.\nSo, when you’re just looking at the heat output, it does not matter at all whether you use one space heater or the other.\nHowever, when you look for the space heater that’s the safest to touch, in physical terms, you’re looking for low surface temperature heaters.\nNow, you can group all space heaters into two categories:\nSpace heaters with exposed heating elements Space heaters with hidden heating elements All space heaters with exposed heating elements have surface temperatures hot enough to ignite things. This group includes infrared heaters and propane heaters.\nOn the other hand:\nAll space heaters with hidden heating elements are not hot to touch because the heat is distributed over the entire space heater’s surface or through a stream of air, which carries the heat away from the heater.\nHeaters with hidden elements are, for example, oil-filled radiators. The heating element of an oil-filled radiator sits inside the large metal case, which, in turn, distributes the heat.\nAnother example of heaters with hidden heating elements are some heaters with built-in fans, which rely on blowing the air out.\nThe most prominent examples of those heaters are Dyson Hot + Cool fans. Since they have both a hidden heating element and they blow out air, the heat never accumulates.\nIn oil-filled radiators, heat accumulates, but to a tolerable point.\nSurface temperatures of different space heaters Using a laser thermometer, I measured the surface temperatures of different space heaters.\nSpace Heater type****Surface Temperature in °F and °COil-filled radiator158°F (70°C)Infrared heater350°F (177°C)Propane heater850°F (454°C)\nAs you can see, the surface temperature grows exponentially with the heating element exposure level.\nThe heating element in an oil-filled radiator is inaccessible. Before the heat reaches your room, it distributes over the large metal surface.\nInfrared heaters have exposed heating elements. These get very hot.\nAnd propane heaters have heating elements that are powered through an open gas flame.\nThe heating element exposure level determines the surface temperature of a space heater.\nPropane heaters get hot enough to burn paper! This can\u0026rsquo;t happen with a Dyson Hot + Cool or with an oil-filled radiator.\nDo you really need the coldest-to-touch space heater? Before you buy your heater, let’s just consider one question: Do you really need the absolute coldest-to-touch space heater?\nIn most cases, you don’t have to buy the absolute best heater (the Dyson). You can just as well get the DeLonghi oil-filled radiator, and save some money for yourself.\nOr, actually, you might even be able to get any heater and might not even need the cool-to-the-touch aspect at all.\nSo, let’s look at a few situations.\nKids and pets If you have small kids and pets around, you don’t want them to burn their sensitive fingers (or paws) on the heater.\nThat’s totally understandable.\nEvolution luckily did most of the work already and embedded an understanding of the concept of heat in our genes.\nSo, kids and pets know what heat is.\nThey just have to learn that a new object in their living space is hot. So, if you buy a space heater, expect your kid or pet to touch the heater once.\nBut when it’s hot it will learn quickly to keep some space.\nKids and pets don’t go nuts and burn themselves on purpose. So, you should not worry about that.\nIn the end, many households use fireplaces or wood stoves, even with small kids or pets around. It’s not a problem. Kids and pets learn and adapt.\nSo, buying a not-hot-to-touch space heater is more for you. It’s to free your mind of worry. In the end, if something happens, you want to tell yourself that you at least bought the safest heater. And that’s OK.\nBut don’t underestimate your kids and pets!\nFire hazard worries It’s totally understandable if you worry about fire hazards caused by space heaters.\nHowever, in this case, getting the space heater with the lowest surface temperature is not always the right solution.\nMost space heater fires are caused by cable meltdown when a heater draws more power than your home’s electric circuit can handle.\nThis has nothing to do with surface temperature. Even the safest space heaters draw enough current to cause an electric failure.\nOf course, a low surface temperature reduces the risk of fire. But so does the number of safety features and, before all, the way you use your heater.\nIf you deliberately look for a safe space heater, then, by definition, you are already the kind of person that takes care of their home safety.\nSo, the chance of your heater causing a fire is very small.\nThe heaters recommended in this article are among the safest you can find. In combination with your safety attitude, and proper, careful usage, there is no need to worry at all.\nWhich not-hot-to-the-touch heaters you should never pick If you look for a cool-to-touch space heater, then your best bet is always a heater with an embedded heating element and a built-in fan that blows the heat out.\nHowever, that’s optimizing in the wrong direction!\nIt’s like choosing a car for its great seat belt. But if the car itself has defective airbags and a chassis that crumbles upon impact, you didn’t do yourself a favor.\nYou get the point.\nA low surface temperature that is not hot to the touch is one aspect of a safe space heater.\nBut:\nA low surface temperature that’s not hot to the touch doesn’t make a space heater safe if it does not also come with tip-over protection, overheat protection, and fireproof case material.\nOne space heater I have at home actually has the lowest of all my different space heater’s surface temperatures.\nInterestingly, it’s also the trashiest of all my heaters. If I run it continuously, it’s just a matter of time before it catches fire.\nIt has a poor-quality plastic case and no safety features at all.\nThe low surface temperature comes only from the hidden heating element in combination with its built-in fan.\nSo, never pick a space heater for it’s cool to the touch surface only. It might still be a bad heater.\nInstead, get a heater that has a low surface temperature, in combination with fireproof case material and all the safety features.\nBoth the Dyson and the DeLonghi heater recommended at the beginning of this article fulfill all the criteria of a safe, quality heater!\nYou can’t go wrong with them.\nConclusion Space heaters that are not hot to the touch are a great choice to reduce your own worries.\nWhen you are concerned about your kids or pets at home, or about fire-hazard, then a cool-to-touch space heater provides the impression of safety.\nSo, let me sum up this article with two key learnings:\nKids and pets are capable of learning which things to touch and which to avoid. Yes, they might burn their fingers on the heater. But this will happen only once. _\n_ So, theoretically, you don’t need to buy an extra safe space heater. But I don’t know your exact situation. You decide! Even space heaters with low surface temperatures consume high amounts of electric power.\nElectric power issues in combination with leaving a space heater unattended are the number 1 causes of space heater incidents.\nSo, you don’t eliminate risks with a low-surface-temperature heater. You eliminate the risk of a fire by never running your space heater in your absence!

In this article, you’re getting a complete list of things you should inspect before you declare your evaporative cooler dead.\nWe’re going to check the most common issues and their fixes. And along the way, you’re going to learn a bunch about the inner workings of your cooler.\nQuick answer: An evaporative cooler won’t turn on if it does not receive electric power. This could be due to a broken wall outlet, power cord, or blown fuse. But broken parts such as blown electronics, water damage, or an empty water tank can also stop your evaporative cooler from turning on.\nThere are many different causes. And even more fixes. So, let’s dive right in.\n7 Causes and fixes for an evaporative cooler not turning on Many things can break in an evaporative cooler.\nHowever, if your evaporative cooler doesn’t even turn on, you can boil down the possible broken parts to just those few that can impact the power supply.\nEither a broken part prevents electric power from reaching other components of your swamp cooler. Or a broken part absorbs all of the power because it is broken.\nTo get your evaporative cooler running again, we have to check your entire power supply chain (from fuses to wall outlet to cooler fan) together.\nLet’s have a look:\n1. Broken power cord or extension cord The first thing to check is your evaporative cooler’s power cord. And, if you use one, also the extension cord.\nPower cord issues usually occur when your swamp cooler is older and you frequently move it around.\nOver time, the bending and twisting wear down the power cord. It’s just a matter of time until you get a loose contact somewhere in the cable.\nSo, check your power cord.\nHow to test There are multiple ways to test for a broken power cord or extension cord.\nTo check a broken power cord, you have to plug it in the wall outlet. If you can unplug the power cord from the evaporative cooler, you are lucky!\nIn this case, you can use a multimeter (or any form of voltage meter) to check whether there is a voltage on the power cord.\nIf you can measure a voltage, then try moving the cord around, and measure again in different positions. Is there any position where your power cord carries no voltage?\nIf you don’t have a multimeter, then you can also plug your power cord into your evaporative cooler, switch the “ON”-switch on, and then move the evaporative cooler around. Also, wiggle the power cord close to both ends around.\nIf there is a loose contact, your evaporative cooler will turn on for a split second.\nIf you can’t unplug your power cord from your evaporative cooler, then you have to open your evaporative cooler’s case. Inside the cooler, check for any voltages directly on the electric circuit boards, or on the connection point where the power cord is soldered to the internal circuitry.\nIf you can measure your wall outlet’s voltage somewhere in the cooler, your power cord is fine.\nTesting for a broken extension cord is simpler. Just plug your evaporative cooler directly into a wall outlet (without the extension cord).\nIf it works without the extension cord but not with it, then your extension cord is broken.\nHow to fix If you notice that your power cord is broken, get a replacement cord either online or in an electronic hardware store.\nAlternatively, find any broken or unused electronic appliance around your house and repurpose its power cord ( …so, yes, just cut it off ).\nIf the power cord of your evaporative cooler has a plug, then cut that plug off. Then connect and solder it to the new replacement power cord.\nElse, if it doesn’t have a plug and connects directly to the internal electronics, then replace the existing power cord by unsoldering it and soldering the new cord in place.\nNow you have a new power cord and your evaporative cooler should turn on again!\nYou can easily replace a broken extension cord by buying a new one.\nEvaporative coolers use very little power. Even large units rarely use more than 400 Watts.\nThe reason is that the most power-hungry component is the built-in fan. And fans use very little power.\nFor comparison, I have a very strong floor fan, which was sold as an industrial wind machine. It uses 120W.\nSo, most evaporative coolers use less than that.\nAny extension cord can handle that. Even the cheapest ones. Assuming an average power consumption of 100W, it will draw only 1.2 Amps of current.\nAll extension cords are rated above that. This 13 Amps extension cord (click here to view it on amazon) is more than enough.\n2. Wall outlet defective Another reason your evaporative cooler is not turning on is that the wall outlet is not powered.\nSometimes wall outlets break and stop carrying power.\nLuckily, that’s easy to troubleshoot and work around.\nHow to test Plug any other device into the wall outlet you normally use with your evaporative cooler. I recommend just plugging in your phone with the phone charger.\nDoes the wall outlet work?\nTo double-check, you can carry the evaporative cooler to another wall outlet and plug it in there.\nDoes it turn on now?\nIf the original wall outlet doesn’t work, even with another device, and your evaporative cooler turns on with another wall outlet, then your wall outlet is defective.\nFor some reason, it carries no power.\nOn the other hand, if the wall outlet works with another device and your evaporative cooler doesn’t turn on, even on another wall outlet, then the wall outlets are fine and the power issue is somewhere inside your cooler.\nHow to fix I recommend having a professional fix your wall outlet. But if you’re familiar with wall outlets, or at least you don’t have two left hands and you are willing to learn something, then you can replace your wall outlet with a new one.\nYou can buy replacement wall outlets in any hardware store, or, of course also online.\nUse this video to follow along:\n\u0026amp;ab_channel=ShaunBranigan\nBefore you get to fix your wall outlet, you can run your evaporative cooler off another wall outlet!\n3. Tripped circuit breaker or blown fuse Your wall outlet looks fine but there is no power on it? Maybe it’s just a blown fuse or a tripped circuit breaker.\nFuses and circuit breakers are protection mechanisms. They protect your home’s electric circuit from carrying too high currents, which can cause overheating, and, eventually, house fires.\nIf your evaporative cooler doesn’t turn on, it might just be a blown fuse of a tripped circuit breaker.\nLet’s check it together.\nCheck your electric service panels for out-of-place switches.\nHow to test To see whether one of your fuses or circuit breakers blew, go to your home’s electric service panel.\nThere, you see multiple rows of switches which are the circuit breakers.\nAlso, check the fuses inside your electric service panel. Fuses are these glass tubes with a thin metal wire inside.\nIn one or more of them, you might not be able to see any wire. Or you see a wire, but it’s broken. Those are the blown fuses!\nHow to fix Check, if all of the circuit breakers are switched on.\nIf one of them is out of place, then switch it to match the state of the others.\nUsually, you can find current ratings on your fuse (e.g. 15 Amps or 20 Amps).\nReplace the broken fuses with matching replacement fuses.\nIf you are not sure which amperage your fuse has, then buy a 15A replacement fuse. Better cut off electricity too early than too late.\n4. Empty water tank Evaporative coolers always need soaked water pads to produce cold air. Usually, when the water pads are dry, your cooler will turn on, but it will act as a regular fan, just blowing air (instead of blowing cold air).\nDepending on the design of the electric controls a pump may or may not turn on automatically to refill the pads.\nHowever, in some (honestly rare) cases, it may be that your evaporative cooler doesn’t turn on at all when the built-in water tank is empty.\nHow to test Refill the water tank and see if it turns on.\nIf your evaporative cooler turns on with a full water tank, then it likely has a sensor that’s measuring water levels.\nAlso, check the user manual for whether there’s a warning light indicating a low water level.\nIn some evaporative coolers, you can connect a water line directly, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need to manually refill a tank\nHow to fix Depending on the evaporative cooler model you have, there are two possible fixes.\nThe first fix for empty water tanks is, obviously, manually refilling them.\nBut some evaporative coolers can be attached to an external water pump or to a tap. The cooler then refills automatically.\nMost coolers with built-in water tanks, however, don’t have a connection point for an external water source. That’s why they have a built-in water tank in the first place.\nSo, in most cases, you have to refill the water manually.\n5. Broken part in electronic circuitry Evaporative coolers have built-in electronic parts, such as a power module and a thermostat.\nSometimes these parts can break. Evaporative coolers are especially prone to electronic issues since they contain water.\nSo, one frequent problem in evaporative coolers is water damage. Water can short-circuit parts on the electronic circuit boards.\nBut some electronic parts can break on their own. Electronic manufacturers usually test the circuitry they produce.\nBut sometimes a part that’s out of tolerance goes unnoticed. Tolerance issues are very hard to detect.\nIn the long run, out-of-tolerance parts either break down themselves or cause other parts to break.\nHow to test The easiest way to test for broken electronics in an evaporative cooler is a visual inspection.\nDisassemble your cooler until you can access the electronic circuitry.\nThen, using a lamp and a magnifying glass inspect the electronics for a few minutes. Usually, when there’s an error you can see it after a couple of minutes of staring at the circuitry.\nYou should look out for burn marks, stains, and broken-off pieces. Sometimes (although this happens rarely) you can also see parts “hovering” one of their ends above the solder joint without connecting to it.\nHow to fix If you find a broken part, replace it with a matching replacement part. You can find replacements online or in a hardware store.\nFor most through-hole-technology (THT) components, you can find equivalent replacement parts by looking for matching color codes (for resistors) or matching the ratings printed on the case of the part.\nIt’s harder to replace broken surface-mounted-device (SMD) components that are soldered onto a circuit board’s surface (without going through any holes).\nThese are usually very small and don’t have any ratings or color codes. But you can find a matching SMD part on the circuit board and measure its resistance, inductance, and capacity. This way, you know which replacement part to buy.\nTo replace the parts you usually have to use a soldering iron.\n6. Stuck or broken fan When the fan inside your evaporative cooler is stuck or broken, it changes its electrical properties.\nA moving fan converts most of the input power to kinetic (movement) energy.\nA stuck fan, on the other hand, usually is a short circuit, because all of the electric power passes through it without being converted to movement.\nSo, an issue in your fan can cause your entire evaporative cooler to not turn on.\nA broken part can cause the fan to stop rotating\nHow to test To test for a stuck or broken fan in your cooler, open the case and inspect the fan.\nTry to rotate it manually. Is it hard to turn? If it is, then there might be an issue with the bearings.\nAlso, check whether something external blocks the movement of the blades. For example, when a plastic part is stuck between the fan blades, it stops the fan from moving.\nA third possible cause could be dust that blocks the fan.\nHow to fix In most cases, evaporative cooler fans last for a long time and bearings are not the case. So, make sure your fan is free of dust and any other parts blocking the movement.\nIf your fan doesn’t rotate easily, try adding a silicone lubricant such as WD-40.\nOnly if it still does not rotate, consider replacing the fan with a new one.\nTo replace the fan you need to be lucky. Usually, evaporative coolers have custom-built fans. They are not standardized such as computer fans.\nI’d suggest contacting the manufacturer for a replacement fan.\n7. Thermostat setting is too high The thermostat inside your evaporative cooler controls all the other components (including the pump and the fan).\nIf your evaporative cooler does not turn on at all, the thermostat obviously doesn’t turn on as well.\nBut if your evaporative cooler turns on (which you can tell by lights or a display turning on), then the reason for it not doing anything might be the thermostat setting.\nAn evaporative cooler only turns on when the target temperature (which you set on the cooler’s front panel) is below your current room temperature.\nOnly then, it makes sense for the thermostat to turn on the fan.\nSo, it might just be that you have to decrease the thermostat settings.\nHow to test Check the temperature reading on your front panel. If there is none, check the power knob.\nHow to fix To fix your thermostat not turning on, lower the temperature. If it still doesn’t turn on, the issue is likely somewhere else.\nWhat to do if your evaporative cooler still doesn’t turn on? Evaporative coolers are very durable devices. And they rarely break to the point that you don’t even get them to turn on.\nThere are very few moving parts in an evaporative cooler. Essentially, it’s just a fan. And some coolers also have a built-in pump.\nBut that’s it.\nUsually, the simpler a device is, the longer it works. And evaporative coolers are supposed to work for at least a decade.\nSo, if your evaporative cooler doesn’t turn on, I’d say you either got really unlucky and somehow water spilled onto the electronics, or the manufacturer messed up.\nIn both cases, I recommend just getting a new quality evaporative cooler.\nI always recommend this Hessaire evaporative cooler(click here to view it on amazon).\nIt’s battle-tested and is the most purchased evaporative cooler in the US.\nSo, you can rely on that one.\nI admit it’s more expensive than other coolers. And it looks bulky. But it’s well worth the price.\nIt’s a one-off higher expense for 10 years of worry-free cooling.\nConclusion The list of problems and fixes in this article should help you troubleshoot (and hopefully fix) your evaporative cooler not turning on!\nIf you can’t get it working even after hours of investigating possible issues, or if you don’t have the electronic knowledge to troubleshoot it, then I recommend just getting a new cooler.\nQuality evaporative coolers are not cheap. But instead of wasting your free time trying to desperately fix things, you can just free yourself and get a new cooler.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/evaporative-cooler-not-turning-on/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour evaporative cooler is not turning on?

Usually, cleaning the clogged parts, replacing air filters, and checking the connection points of the water lines solves the issue.\nBut there can be many more reasons and possible fixes!\nDon’t worry, we’re going to check almost every possible swamp cooler problem in this article!\nLet’s first have a look at a rough overview of all the issues causes in this article:\nSummary: Reasons for a swamp cooler not blowing cold air Reason****How to fix itBroken fanReplace the fanClogged fan or air filterClean the fan and replace air filtersDry water padsRefill the water pads manuallyWater pump brokenReplace water pump and connect water lines tightlyWater level sensor brokenReplace the water level sensorClogged water linesClean water lines with a wire brush and vinegar or lemon juiceThermostat brokenReplace blown or broken electronic partsRipped or worn-out V-beltReplace the V-belt with a matching-size oneOtherGet a new swamp cooler\n8 Ways to fix your Swamp Cooler not blowing cold air Let’s have a look at all the different reasons for your swamp cooler not working, and ways to test and fix it!\n1. Fan broken One of the most common reasons for a swamp cooler not blowing cold air is when the fan stops working.\nSwamp coolers are evaporative coolers. So, by definition, they only blow cold air when water evaporates.\nWithout a constant airflow, the water in the soaked water pads won’t evaporate quickly. Technically, there is still evaporation. It’s just much less than with a working fan.\nSlow evaporation does not produce noticeable cold air, because before the cold air from the evaporation process reaches you (which takes a while because there is no airflow), it heats up.\nSo, an evaporative cooler with a broken fan is a humidifier at most.\nBut why do swamp cooler fans break?\nWhen you compare the fan inside an evaporative cooler with a regular pedestal or floor fan, one difference is apparent. Swamp cooler fans can’t move as freely as other fans.\nThey have to press air through soaked water pads. This increases the wear-down rate of swamp cooler fans.\nThe bearings, fan blades, and rotational axis have to exert and withstand much larger forces than regular fans.\nYou can verify this with a simple experiment. Try to blow air through a sponge. Then blow air without any obstructions. The difference in blowing power needed is significant.\nThe fans inside swamp coolers unfortunately rarely are any better than regular fans. Especially in portable swamp coolers.\nIt makes me wonder why manufacturers put these regular fans inside swamp coolers. But well… it’s all about the money.\nA broken plastic part blocking the fan in a swamp cooler can cause it to stop working\nHow to test Testing a broken fan is very simple. Just turn on your evaporative cooler and see what happens.\nDoes the fan blow air? If yes, then your fan works… obviously.\nIf your fan does not rotate then it is likely broken.\nNow, you have to find out why it does not rotate. First off, are there any obstructions in the fan blades?\nIf there are obstructions, then head over to the next section which is about clogged fans.\nIf, however, your fan does not rotate at all, even though it is free of dirt, dust, and other obstructions, these could be the reasons:\nBroken or corroded fan power supply Thermostat does not activate fan Broken bearings You can do the following quick test:\nDisconnect the fan and connect the wires to a battery. Does it rotate now? If yes, then your fan is working fine and the problem is somewhere in the electronics of your swamp cooler.\nHowever, if it does not work, then your fan is, indeed broken.\nYou can oftentimes hear an accompanying buzzing noise coming from your swamp cooler’s electronics.\nThat’s because the swamp cooler receives electric power from the power supply, but, because the fan does not blow, the swamp cooler can’t use the power anywhere.\nPower always needs an outlet. Oftentimes, it ends up in the electronic circuitry where it overloads capacitors and inductors, or the electromagnetic motor inside the fan, which starts buzzing.\nHow to fix If your fan is broken, you have to replace it with an equivalent replacement part. Fan sizes vary with the swamp cooler’s size.\nSo, there’s no one-fits-all solution.\nSmall indoor portable swamp coolers should be compatible with this Noctua fan(click here to view it on amazon).\nPlease note that this is actually a computer fan. So, it is only for small evaporative coolers.\nFor larger swamp coolers, it’s difficult to find a model that fits all.\nTo find a proper replacement, open your swamp cooler, find the fan model number and look for replacement parts online.\nIf you can’t find a proper replacement fan, then you can measure the fan’s dimensions and find a replacement fan that roughly matches.\nAnd if you still can’t find anything that fits (some swamp coolers have very uniquely-sized fans), then you can also just get a new swamp cooler.\n( I recommend a quality model that won’t break at the bottom of this article )\n2. Clogged fan or air filter Another possible cause for your swamp cooler not blowing cold air is a clogged fan.\nA clogged fan is much better than a broken fan because it’s very easy to fix. You just have to do a thorough cleaning.\nSwamp coolers rely on constant airflow to work. However, the air in our living spaces is full of dust. So, essentially, swamp coolers are drawing a constant stream of dust.\nThe air draft always passes through the soaked water pads. The water pads filter the air.\nSo, there are two or three places where dirt can build up:\nThe fan itself Water pads The air filter (if one is present) Not all swamp coolers have air filters, so the last point is optional.\nWith increasing running time, the amount of dust, dirt, and grease inside your swamp cooler increases.\nEach increment of dust inside your swamp cooler reduces the airflow.\nSo, it is mathematically just a matter of time until your swamp cooler stops working due to full dust blockage.\nExtremely dirty air filters prevent proper airflow and therefore stop your evaporative cooler from cooling (image by DanDaue)\nHow to test To test for this cause, open your swamp cooler and check the fan, the air filter (if there is one), and the water pads.\nIf your swamp cooler is clogged, you should see a lot of dust or dirt inside it.\nHow to fix First of all, remove the water pads from your swamp cooler. Rinse them in running water. You can also add soap to get the grease and bacteria off. You will see a lot of dirt coming out.\nThen you can place the wet water pads in your swamp cooler again. They need to be wet anyways, so there’s no real need for drying at this point.\nThen, clean the fan using a dry brush. You can just use an old toothbrush for this.\nIf there is sticky grease on your fan, you can use a fat-dissolving kitchen grease cleaner.\nHowever, if the clogging is merely due to dust, use the dry toothbrush without additional cleaning products.\nLiquids and dust usually don’t go well with each other. Either the dust gets more dense, or it starts growing mold and stinks.\nYou can unclog your air filters with a dry brush as well. However, you should replace the air filters regularly anyways.\nSo, use this as an opportunity to put in new filters! New filters will allow for much better airflow.\n3. Dry water pads Another possible cause of your swamp cooler not blowing cold air is when your water pads are dry.\nEvaporative coolers need water to work. The water in your swamp cooler’s water pads absorbs the heat energy from your living space to vaporize.\nThis leaves cold air behind, which the fan in your swamp cooler then blows into your room.\nIf your swamp cooler’s water pads are dry, it is basically just a fan.\nNow, you might wonder why I even list dry water pads as a point. In the end, it’s the most obvious reason for a swamp cooler not cooling.\nThe reason is that dry water pads are usually a symptom of other issues in your swamp cooler.\nIn the next sections, we dissect these deeper causes.\nSo, let’s first check the state of your water pads.\nHow to test Open your swamp cooler and touch the water pads. Do they feel wet or dry?\nAlternatively, you can remove the water pads and squeeze them out over your kitchen sink. See how much water comes out.\nHow to fix To fix dry water pads, you have to first find out why they are dry. There are multiple possible reasons for dry water pads.\nThe most common causes are a broken pump, a broken water level sensor, or clogged water lines.\nAlso, if you refill your swamp cooler manually, then forgetting to refill can also be a cause.\nLet’s have a look at each of those issues in the next sections.\n4. Water pump broken When the water pump in your swamp cooler is broken, it can’t refill the water pads.\nSo, after some time of running your swamp cooler, after all the water in the water pads evaporates, it stops blowing cold air.\nBroken pumps are very common. And they are hard to detect since the blowing fan in a swamp cooler produces the illusion that your swamp cooler works fine.\nHow to test Turn on your swamp cooler (with dry water pads) and listen for pump sounds. If your pump works, it should switch on soon.\nThere are two possibilities now:\nEither your pump turns on and makes the typical pumping noise. Or it doesn’t turn in.\nIf it doesn’t turn on, you can assume it’s broken.\nHowever, if your pump turns on and the water pads still don’t refill, the issue might be in the water distribution lines connected to the hose.\nMaybe there is a loose connection.\nHow to fix If you absolutely hate fixing electronics and replacing parts, you can technically refill the water pads manually.\nBut it gets annoying after some time. So, I recommend fixing the issue instead.\nYou can replace most swamp cooler pumps with this Dial Manufacturing UL standard pump (click here to view it on amazon).\nIf you suspect your pump still works (because it makes a noise), then double-check all the connection points of the water lines.\nSee, if water leaks anywhere. You can follow the path of water coming out of the pump. At one point you should see a leak.\nIf you don’t find anything, it might be the case that your pump is broken, but still makes a noise. This can happen if the bearings inside are worn down, or when an internal part is clogged.\n5. Water level sensor broken Some swamp coolers have a built-in water level sensor. The water level sensor either measures the humidity of the water pads directly or the water level of an internal water tank.\nThe water level sensor signals the electronic control system whether the pump needs to turn on and refill water, or not.\nWhen the water level sensor inside your swamp cooler is broken, the pump won’t turn on.\nAnd, therefore, your swamp cooler soon stops blowing cold air.\nHow to test Check whether your swamp cooler has a built-in water level sensor.\nYou can either do that by checking the manual. Or you simply open up the swamp cooler and see if there is any sensor-like device that’s mounted to a water tank or to water pads.\nNow, technically, if the water level sensor is broken, you can’t really test it directly.\nBut you can imitate a working water level sensor by applying a small voltage to the connection points of the water level sensor.\nYou should only do that if you are familiar with electronics.\nYou can apply such a small imitation voltage to the circuitry using a battery or a voltage generator.\nHow to fix Fixing a broken water level sensor is usually simpler than testing it.\nJust find the part number of your water level sensor and contact the manufacturer for a replacement part.\nMaybe you can also find a matching part online. Replace the water level sensor.\nAfter replacing, when you run your swamp cooler again, the sensor should signal the pump to turn on and refill the water pads again.\n6. Clogged water lines Swamp coolers have two water-carrying components:\nOne water line connects to the swamp cooler from the outside. This is usually the water line connecting a tap or a tank of water with the swamp cooler.\nAnd then you got the inside part of your swamp cooler. There, the water line splits up into multiple individual lines (depending on the specific swamp cooler model) which refill the water pads.\nIf the water line is clogged, it can’t distribute water.\nNormally, water lines don’t clog. However, depending on the water source you use, algae, lime, and dirt can accumulate in the water lines over time.\nWhen the water line in a swamp cooler is clogged, too little water flows through it and your water pads don\u0026rsquo;t get humid enough to produce cold air\nHow to test Disconnect the water lines from your swamp cooler. Try to pass water through them and see how well it flows.\nSome water lines are transparent, so you might even be able to see obstructions.\nIf you notice the water does not flow properly through the hose, then it is likely clogged.\nHow to fix Pass a wire brush through the water line and unclog it. Most water-induced clogs are easy to unblock.\nHowever, sometimes, especially with limescale, it is hard to remove with a brush.\nIn this case, you should first dissolve the limescale with vinegar or lemon juice.\nAlternatively, just get a new water line. Usually, they are just a few bucks at hardware stores.\n7. Thermostat broken Thermostats control other components, the so-called actors, in your swamp cooler, such as the water pump and the fan.\nThe thermostat is the brain of your swamp cooler. It knows your current room temperature and the wetness of the water pads. And based on these two inputs, it controls the pump and the fan.\nWhen the thermostat inside your swamp cooler is broken, your pump and fan either won’t turn on, or they will turn on unexpectedly.\nFor example, a well-working thermostat won’t activate the fan when the water pads are dry. First, it refills the water pads. And only then it turns on the fan.\nBut running the fans with dry water pads does not make sense.\nA broken thermostat can cause these kinds of pointless behaviors, which can cause your swamp cooler to not blow cold air.\nHow to test The thermostat is the mediator between many different components in your swamp cooler. So, it is very hard to troubleshoot.\nThe best way to verify that your thermostat is broken is by activating the pump and the fan manually.\nYou can only do that if you have a third-party power source such as a voltage generator.\nWhen the pump and fan work when you power them manually, but not when the swamp cooler runs, then your thermostat is broken.\nHow to fix You can’t really fix a broken thermostat in most cases. Usually, thermostats vary significantly between manufacturers. So, there is no one-size-fits-all thermostat that you can put in any device.\nIf your thermostat is broken, I recommend getting a new swamp cooler.\nUsually, thermostat repairs are not worth the time and effort.\nIf, however, you are dedicated to repairing your swamp cooler’s thermostat, the first thing you should look at is the thermostat’s circuit board.\nLook out for blown or broken parts. Usually, when there is an electronic issue, you can see it.\nThen, check the connection points between the actors (pump, fan), the thermostat, and its sensors (water level, thermometer).\nIf you find an issue in any of those places, you can usually fix it yourself with a replacement part and a soldering iron.\nHowever, if you don’t find the issue, then the problem might be a hard-to-detect water damage.\n8. Ripped V-belt In large swamp coolers, the motor and fan are separate components. They connect with a V-belt.\nNot all swamp coolers have a V-belt. Smaller coolers usually power the fan directly. But large swamp coolers such as roof units have a separate motor and fan.\nWhen the motor axis rotates, the V-shaped belt transmits the rotational movement to the fan.\nSo, the point of the V-belt in a swamp cooler is to connect the motor and fan.\nAnd when a V-belt breaks, it, obviously, can’t transmit the rotational power to turn the fan. And then, your swamp cooler stops blowing cold air.\nUsually, V-belts last a very long time. They are even used in cars. And you rarely have to exchange them.\nHowever, because they are moving parts, they wear down with time. And so it can happen that they tear.\nHow to test Open your swamp cooler and check the V-belt. You can immediately recognize a torn belt.\nBut it might also be the case that your V-belt is not entirely torn but very worn out.\nIn this case, turn on your swamp cooler and see whether the V-belt is able to power the fan.\nA worn-out V-belt slips and doesn’t transmit rotational power.\nHow to fix Check the dimensions (width and length) of your evaporative cooler V-belt. Then, get a matching replacement belt.\nI recommend this replacement V-belt(click to view it on amazon). You can pick different size options. Get the one that fits.\nTo find a matching width and length, either measure the torn V-belt in your evaporative cooler. Or read the specs on the label imprinted on the belt.\nV-belts like this are used in large swamp coolers\nWhat if your swamp cooler still is not blowing cold air? Most swamp cooler problems are relatively easy to fix. However, if you can’t find or fix the issue in your swamp cooler, then I recommend getting a new one.\nI recommend this Hessaire evaporative cooler (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis one is a bit more expensive than other portable evaporative coolers. But I always prefer to get a quality product once than to have to rebuy things.\nGetting a new cooler not only solves your cooling problem but it also saves you hours of troubleshooting and fixing time. And maybe even a technician to inspect it.\nSo, it’s money spent to worry less.\nThat’s a great philosophy to live by and a good use of money. Instead of wasting money on your broken device, buy yourself the stress relief and get a working quality product.\nYou can sell the broken device online if you like. Lots of people like to repair things and happily buy defective devices. Another win-win situation.\nYou get rid of your old, broken stuff, and you make someone else happy.\nConclusion Most swamp cooler issues boil down to the fan not rotating or water supply issues.\nTo fix your swamp cooler, make sure that the water pump works, the water lines are unclogged, and the fan rotates.\nUsing the causes and fixes in this guide, you should be able to fix 95% of swamp cooler issues.\nHowever, if you can’t fix your swamp cooler and you are sick of researching possible issues, just get a new device.\nYou don’t gain anything from driving yourself to despair!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/swamp-cooler-not-blowing-cold-air/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour swamp cooler is not blowing cold air?

In this article, we’re going to cover the most common noise types, including humming, screeching, buzzing, and more.\nFor each noise, you’re going to learn where it comes from and how you can fix it.\nQuick answer: Swamp coolers often make humming, gurgling and crackling noises. These are expected. You can reduce these normal noises with anti-vibration pads. Screeching, buzzing, scratching and banging noises are signs of unlubricated parts, loose parts, or faulty electronics. You can fix these noises with silicone lubricant, by tightening the parts in place, or by replacing the noisy parts.\nSummary: Swamp cooler noise causes \u0026amp; fixes First, let’s have a look at the different noise types and whether they are dangerous or not.\n**Noise typeCauseIs it dangerous?**HummingLoose installation, fan blowing, electronicsnoScreetchingIssue in power electronicsyesBuzzing noiseStuck or clogged fan, issue in power electronicsyesGurgling noiseAir in water distribution linesnoCrackling noiseParts expanding or contracting due to temperature changenoScratching noiseFan bearings brokenyesBanging noiseFan or motor brokenyes\n7 Swamp Cooler Noises and how to fix them Noise is always a sign of vibration. And vibration, in turn, is always caused by moving parts in a system.\nA swamp cooler has many parts where things move. The most obvious is the built-in fan. The fan is either standalone (with a built-in electromagnetic motor), or in larger evaporative coolers, the fan and motor engine are separate components, connected by a V-belt.\nMany swamp coolers also have a built-in pump, which can create noise.\nBut there are even more possible noise sources. Let’s have a look at all the noises and their causes in more detail!\n1. Humming noise A low-frequency humming noise is one of the most-common noise types in swamp coolers.\nFirst off, many electric devices hum, since the electricity powering them is a low-frequency 50-60Hz alternating current.\nSo, if electricity causes noise, then it is likely a humming (unless there is a frequency transformation somewhere in the electronics, which is very unlikely).\nThe fan and the motor also operate at low speeds. Actually, a swamp cooler fan rotates quickly and blows a lot of air. But high fan speeds still result in low-frequency humming.\nImagine the fan in your swamp cooler rotates 1,000 times per minute. Sounds fast, right? Some strong fans even get up to 2,000 rounds per minute (RPM).\nBut in terms of frequency, that’s only\n1,000 RPM ÷ 60 s/m (seconds per minute) = 16.67Hz\nto\n2,000 RPM ÷ 60 s/m (seconds per minute) = 33.33Hz\nSo, even very fast fans produce very low-frequency humming noises.\nThe floor your swamp cooler stands on carries this low-frequency humming noise through the walls and possibly even amplifies it (if it is close to the resonant frequency of your walls).\nThe pump could, theoretically, also be a source of the humming noise. But usually, the pump only runs occasionally to refill the water pads. So, it won’t produce continuous humming.\nHow to test You can test where the noise comes from by answering the following questions:\nIs the humming noise continuous? If yes, then it is likely your fan (or the fan motor). Else, the noise comes from your pump. Check if water sounds occur in combination with the humming noise.\nYou can double-check it by lowering the fan settings. If the humming decreases with decreasing fan settings, then the issue is for sure the fan.\nIf the humming is constant, regardless of the fan setting, the issue could be in the electronics, which respond to AC current with humming.\nHow to fix You can’t really fix the humming in your swamp cooler pump unless you know very well what you’re doing. And you likely need special tools to open the pump and troubleshoot it.\nThere are two ways to resolve a humming pump:\nThe first solution is to replace the pump. Get an equivalent swamp cooler pump online, disassemble your swamp cooler, install the new pump and see if that helps.\nThe other solution (which I recommend) is to just accept your humming pump. You won’t find a pump that is absolutely silent. Although… when I think about it… if you really want a silent pump, you might be able to install a gaming PC water pump in your swamp cooler. These are of higher quality and designed for silence.\nA humming pump is not dangerous. It is a mere inconvenience.\nIf the fan in your swamp cooler causes a continuous humming, your best bet is to simply place it on anti-vibration pads. I recommend these anti-vibration pads (click here to view them on amazon). They are designed for washing machines. But they work just as well for swamp coolers (which are a lot quieter than washing machines).\nAnti-vibration pads absorb the noise and prevent it from being carried through the floor\nTheoretically, you could also replace the fan in your swamp cooler. But fans usually produce little noise as long as they are intact.\nThe key cause for swamp cooler humming is the amplification of small vibrations in the fan through the floor and walls. You can only fix this using anti-vibration pads.\nLastly, if you found your swamp cooler hums because of an electronic component, then I recommend the following:\nDisconnect your swamp cooler from the power supply. Open its case and disassemble it until you see the electronic circuitry. Visually inspect the circuit boards and see if you find any blown or broken parts.\nIf you find something, replace it with an equivalent part. You can get them online or in a hardware store.\nElse, if you don’t see any obvious issues in the electronic circuitry, you probably have to accept the humming as it is.\nTechnically, you can troubleshoot this until you find the issue, but the cause of humming is usually slight tolerance deviations in the electronics. Unless you have manufacturer-level knowledge, you are out of options.\n2. Screeching noise Screeching noises are very similar to humming noises. Usually, they are louder and higher pitched.\nOne frequent source of screeching is when unlubricated metal parts rub against each other. The metal parts excite vibrations in each other. And because metal parts are usually solid and have a high density, their resonance frequency is very high, which, in turn, causes the screeching sound.\nLubrication almost cuts out all of the friction and, therefore, eliminates the screeching sound.\nOftentimes screeching sounds also occur when you don’t use your device for a longer time due to corrosion. During this time, parts corrode. When you first turn on your device again, it screeches until the corrosion wears off.\nOne everyday example I encounter frequently is when I ride my bike. Especially when my last ride was in wet weather. When I jump on my bicycle and hit the brakes for the first time, they screech extremely loudly! Almost as loud as a car honk!\nBut after breaking for about 15 seconds on a downhill track, the screeching stops because the corrosion wore off.\nIt’s similar in swamp coolers. Especially since swamp coolers are always wet. They are always subject to corrosion.\nA third possible cause of swamp cooler screeching can be broken power electronics. Especially when parts in close proximity to a capacitor or an inductance break, capacitors and inductors start screeching when they are subject to higher AC voltages.\nHow to test You can test the cause of your screeching noise without opening the swamp cooler (at first).\nThe first step is to run your swamp cooler and wait for a few minutes. Does the screeching noise wear off?\nIf the screeching noise gets quieter with time, the cause of the noise is corrosion. Likely, you did not use your swamp cooler for a long time. Or parts in your swamp cooler corroded because of the humidity inside it.\nIn this case, you don’t have to do anything. The corrosion will wear off with increasing running time. Just be patient. You should hear significant improvements within an hour of running.\nIf the screeching noise does not wear off over time, you the issue is either (metal) parts rubbing against each other, or an issue in the power electronics.\nTo test this, you have to open your swamp cooler until you see the fan, pump and the electronic circuitry. Then, run it (with an open case) and hear where the noise comes from.\nHow to fix When your swamp cooler screeches due to corrosion, you can just keep your swamp cooler running and wait for the corrosion to wear off.\nHowever, to prevent future corrosion, I recommend adding lubricant. Usually, you can’t go wrong with this WD-40 silicone lubricant (click here to view it on amazon).\nYou can use that same lubricant if the screeching noise is due to unlubricated parts which produce a continuous screeching sound.\nParts you should lubricate are:\nPump Motor (if there is a separate motor in your cooler) Fan WD-40 lubricant solves most screeching issues.\nHowever, when the screeching comes from your electronic circuitry, you have to find out which part screeches. Usually, capacitors or inductances screech when they (or parts nearby) are broken.\nThe reason is that capacitors and inductances build up alternating electric fields, which causes them to vibrate (and screech) when you apply too high AC voltage to them.\nTo replace broken electronics, unsolder any broken or blown electronic parts you find on the circuit board. This will require some soldering skills.\nWith new parts in place, try running your swamp cooler again. If everything went fine, there should be no screeching.\n3. Buzzing noise Buzzing noise in swamp coolers usually comes from either a broken part in the electronic circuitry, water on the circuitry, or from the pump.\nWhen water accumulates on the electronic circuitry, even if it’s just droplets, it can create connections between parts where there should be none.\nLikely, water in a swamp cooler won’t short-circuit anything, because tap water is used for swamp coolers and the water vapor inside swamp coolers does not contain many ions (salt). So, it’s not a good conductor.\nA distilled water droplet between two electronic components is much like an added resistor between these connections.\nIt likely won’t break anything quickly. But it can alternate the workings of the electronics, which often results in a buzzing sound (if the power conversion component is affected).\nPumps oftentimes also make a buzzing sound. Especially smaller electric pumps. In this case, the noise is normal.\nHow to test To check the source of the buzzing, open your swamp cooler and listen to where the buzzing comes from.\nUsually, you can easily distinguish between buzzing sounds coming from the electronics and those coming from the pump.\nPumps oftentimes vibrate. So, you can also touch the pump and feel the buzzing noise. This helps with the location of the noise source.\nSometimes, when you touch the pump, the buzzing sound changes. Because, essentially, your fingers add dampening to the pump, which can change the resonant frequency and the amplitude of the noise.\n( Don’t touch the electronics! You will feel an electric shock otherwise )\nHow to fix To fix the buzzing noise coming from the electronics, disassemble your swamp cooler and take out any electronic circuit boards you find.\nDry the circuitry (if you find it’s wet). You can use a dry towel for this. And you can also place the electronics outdoors for drying for a few minutes. Swamp cooler electronics are not sensitive, so there’s no problem in doing that.\nAlso, inspect the circuit board for any burn marks and broken parts. Usually, you can see faults with bare eyes.\nIf you find an issue, replace the electronic component with an equivalent one that you get in a hardware store or online.\nYou can’t really fix the buzzing noise in a pump. Most small water pumps just buzz. Theoretically, you have two options.\nReplace the water pump: Get a better water pump online and install it. I recommend this Dial Manufacturing standard pump for swamp coolers (click here to view it on amazon) Don’t use the pump. You can remove it from your swamp cooler and refill the water pads manually.\nThis can, however, be annoying with time. But it guarantees absolute silence! 4. Gurgling noise A Gurgling noise in a swamp cooler can only have one possible cause: Air trapped in the water distribution lines.\nNow, that is absolutely nothing to worry about and technically not dangerous. The gurgling noise is merely an inconvenience.\nSo, you don’t have to fix this issue. But, of course, you can.\nUsually, you will find gurgling noises in the water lines leading to the water pads. But it can also come from the water line that connects the tap (or water bucket) with your water pump.\nGurgling usually comes from the water supply line or from the water distribution lines within the swamp cooler\nHow to test Open your swamp cooler.\nTurn it on and listen to where the gurgling sounds come from. If the water hoses you use are transparent, you might even be able to see the air bubbles trapped in the water lines.\nHow to fix The simplest way to fix gurgling water distribution lines in a swamp cooler is to unmount the water lines, drain them, and reinstall them.\nAlternatively, you might be able to hold the water line upright (so that the air bubbles rise up and leave the hose).\nI prefer the first method since I fix a lot of computer problems with the same philosophy. Just do a full restart, and most problems are gone.\nThe reinstallation of the water lines is like a full reset.\nTo prevent trapped air in your water distribution lines in the future, make sure to connect the water line and pump tightly.\n5. Crackling noise Crackling noises are very common in air conditioning and heating devices. All devices which somehow affect a room’s temperature occasionally crackle.\nThe reason is that due to the temperature change in the swamp cooler, some parts contract. This causes them to rub against other parts, or even do micro-jumps when tiny tensions are released.\nThe crackling noise is completely normal and expected.\nIt does not only occur when the device cools down, but also when it heats up again after you turn it off.\nThe turn-on and turn-off phases are the time periods of the greatest temperature change. So, during these times, swamp coolers tend to create the most crackling sounds.\nIf your swamp cooler crackles continuously for a long time, then the issue might be a part overheating in the electronics. Then, you get a crackling sound that’s similar to a small fire burning.\nHow to test Turn on or off your swamp cooler and listen for a few minutes whether it crackles.\nIf the crackling reduces after some time, after turning it on, then everything is good.\nHowever, if you get a continuous crackling sound, check the electronics and see whether any parts look blown or whether smoke comes out anywhere.\nIf that’s not the case, then your crackling is likely safe.\nIt could also be air bubbles in the water pads popping due to the evaporation.\nHow to fix You don’t have to fix a crackling noise in your evaporative cooler unless it’s a continuous crackling coming from the electronic circuitry.\nIn this case, look for the broken component and replace it with an equivalent replacement part.\nThen, try to run your evaporative cooler again. If the crackling persists, then the issue might be another broken electronic part nearby.\nDouble-check whether you overlooked an issue on the circuitry.\n6. Scratching noise A swamp cooler that makes a scratching noise won’t run for a long time before it breaks down.\nThe typical scratching sound is caused by destructive friction. With destructive friction, I do not mean the expected kind of friction that wears down parts over long periods of time.\nDestructive friction wears down parts within hours or even minutes of usage.\nOnly the moving parts in a swamp cooler can create a scratching noise, such as the pump, the motor, or the fan.\nUsually, a moving part creates a scratching noise when bearings are broken or some screws holding something in place are loose.\nScratching is always a sign that two parts rub against each other, which should not rub against each other.\nIn large swamp coolers (such as a roof swamp cooler, or a larger non-portable device), the motor powers the fan via a V-belt.\nV-belts wear down over time. When a V-belt breaks, or during the time before it breaks, it can cause scratching sounds, because rubber strands separate from the main V-belt body and rub against other parts in your swamp cooler.\nA broken part inside a swamp cooler that can cause scratching sounds\nHow to test Open your swamp cooler. Run it for a few seconds. You should be able to tell quickly where the scratching noise comes from.\nIn some cases, when parts are loose, you also see them shaking around.\nAnd when the V belt is broken, you usually can usually see it wobbling around with loose rubber strands.\nHow to fix If the scratching noise comes from a loose fan, motor, or pump, you can try fastening the screws.\nScratching noise, however, usually indicates a more significant fault in a swamp cooler.\nFor example, loose screws and broken bearings indicate a quality control issue. V-belts can wear down with time, but they should definitely last at least 10 years.\nSo, any swamp cooler that’s younger than 10 years should not have these kinds of failures at all.\nLoose parts don’t loosen on their own. Vibrations usually cause screws to unscrew themselves over the course of months. Even when you tighten the screws again, it’s just a matter of time until they loosen themselves and the scratching noise starts over.\nMost of the time, you are better off buying a new AC unit.\n( I recommend a good one further down below )\n7. Banging noise When parts hit other parts with high impulse, it creates a banging noise.\nBanging noise is the worst kind of noise you can find in a swamp cooler. But banging sounds are very rare in a swamp cooler.\nSwamp coolers are very simple devices. So, there’s not much that can bang around.\nA banging noise would indicate that the fan loosened itself and jumps around inside the swamp cooler.\nOr, alternatively, something fell into the fan’s rotor and is now thrown around.\nA banging noise can happen once, or it can be a continuously recurring banging.\nBoth cases indicate the same kind of problem: One loose part throws itself or another part around inside the swamp cooler. A continuous banging occurs when two parts stick (or somehow interlink) with each other and one part throws the other around.\nHow to test You can open your swamp cooler and see where the banging noise comes from. But be careful. It could be that the part that causes the banging flings at you.\nHow to fix I recommend getting a new swamp cooler. A banging noise is a sign of a complete breakdown.\nAnd the part that caused the banging probably damaged other parts nearby as well.\nIn the worst case, it hit the power electronics. And in a poorly designed swamp cooler, the power electronics could, theoretically, put the water pads under voltage.\nThat’s unlikely but possible.\nAnyways, no swamp cooler should ever make any sounds that go beyond humming or gurgling.\nA banging noise is an absolute no-go. Stop using low-quality swamp coolers.\nWhat if you can’t fix your swamp cooler noise? Swamp coolers are quiet. If your swamp cooler makes annoying noises and you are not able to fix the issue with the ideas from this article, I recommend getting a new swamp cooler.\nI recommend this Hessaire evaporative cooler (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt’s more expensive than other evaporative coolers, but this one will work reliably for decades!\nOf course, you will get a blowing sound with this one (since it got a strong fan). But this one won’t buzz, screech, or make scratching sounds!\nIt’s a one-off investment that will pay off for at least the next decade worth of summers!\nConclusion You can fix most swamp cooler noise issues by checking that the fan rotates freely and lubricating all rotating parts.\nIf you have a larger noise issue, you can exchange the fan or the water pump.\nOr when you are familiar with electronics, you can even fix broken electronics which cause buzzing sounds.\nBut as soon as your swamp cooler makes “break down”-sounds, such as scratching or banging noises, you should get rid of it and get a quality evaporative cooler instead.\nEvaporative coolers don’t cost a fortune. So you should be able to replace yours if it does not work properly.\nSwamp coolers are very simple devices. And due to their simplicity, there’s not much that can break down.\nAnd if anything breaks down, it is usually a quality issue. So, just opt for a better cooler instead.\nAlso, you can take this as an opportunity to have a look at replacing your swamp cooler with an air conditioner.\nACs produce much more cold air than evaporative coolers. They don’t need to constantly as much air as swamp coolers to cool your room, so they are naturally quieter devices than swamp coolers. And, additionally, ACs can be portable as well!\nHere’s a list of the quietest portable ACs!\n( They don’t even cost more than a good swamp cooler )\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/swamp-cooler-making-noise-fixes/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour swamp cooler is making noise?

In this article, we’ll cover all the different noise types in window ACs. For each noise, we check whether it is dangerous, the cause for the noise, and, of course, how to fix it (if necessary).\nQuick answer: Window AC noises are usually not dangerous. But scratching, whistling or banging noises indicate larger failures in your window AC which you have to address. The most common cause for window AC noises is broken parts in the compressor or fan, such as broken bearings or broken brackets which allow the fan or compressor to jump around in your window AC.\nSummary of window AC noises Let’s first have a look at the all different noises that window ACs make, their reasons, and whether they are dangerous.\nAfter the table, you will find a fixing guide for each noise type.\n**Window AC noiseReasonIs it dangerous?**Humming noiseCompressor running or lose window setupnoRattling noiseLoose parts inside AC or in window setupnoBuzzing noiseElectronic issue or stuck moving part causes AC power supply to overloadyesScratching noiseInternal friction in compressor or fannoWhistling / Hissing noiseRefrigerant leakyesGurgling noiseAir trapped in condensate drain or refrigerantnoClicking noiseThermostat switching power settingsnoCrackling noiseParts expanding or compressing due to temperature changenoBanging / Knocking noiseCompressor or fan brokenyes\nCauses and fixes for a window AC making noise Let’s have a look at each window AC noise one-by-one. For each noise, you get an introduction, which helps you understand the cause of the noise.\nAnd then, you get a way to test for the cause and how to repair it. If possible, I also append a section on how to prevent each noise in the future.\n1. Humming noise The most common window AC noise is humming. Humming is always a sign of vibration.\nSince window ACs sit inside your window, the humming from the AC spreads over the entire wall and can even reach other rooms.\nAll window ACs (and ACs in general) have a compressor. The compressor liquifies gaseous refrigerant. The liquid refrigerant absorbs heat from your room, gasifies, and cycles through the compressor again. This process moves heat from your room outdoors.\nCompressors are the loudest part of an AC. Unfortunately, they are also the most important part.\nThere’s nothing you can really do about the compressor noise. Normally, window ACs are relatively quiet. Many window ACs are only 52dB, which is comparable to a quiet refrigerator.\nHumming noise can get very loud if the humming noise of your window AC matches the resonant frequency of your wall or window AC setup.\nAll objects have one frequency at which they begin vibrating uncontrollably. When you sing in the shower, you might notice that some tones sound “extra loud”. That happens when you hit the shower’s resonant frequency!\nIf your window AC hits the resonant frequency of your room, the walls, or the window, the humming noise amplifies.\nSo, the issue is not in the window AC itself. Which is a good thing and makes this problem easy to fix.\nHow to test You can check resonance in your room in two ways. Either turn your window AC on and feel whether the window and the walls vibrate. Also, you can try to match the frequency of your window AC with your voice and see if your voice sounds louder.\n( Better do this when you’re alone, otherwise, people will think you’re a maniac )\nYou can even cross-check whether your window AC hits your room’s resonance frequency by installing your AC in another window in another room. But this takes a lot of time and effort. Do it, if you can. But if you can’t, no problem.\nHow to fix There are two ways to fix the humming noise of a window AC. First, you have to make sure that your window AC sits firmly in your window. There should be no space for it to shake around.\nMany window ACs come with insulating foam tape. Use it! If you don’t have yours anymore, then get this insulating foam tape for ACs(click here to view it on amazon).\nThe tape, the walls, and the window will absorb all the vibration from your window AC.\nAlso, you can add dampening to your room. This can be a simple carpet on the floor or even soundproofing foam that you mount to your walls.\nThis window AC sits too loosely inside the window. To stop the humming, you\u0026rsquo;d need to add insulation around it.\n2. Rattling noise Rattling always indicates loose parts hitting each other. Normally, all the parts in a window AC are fixed and don’t rattle around.\nSo, if you notice rattling in your window AC, it’s a surefire sign that something is going wrong.\nContinuous rattling indicates that the cause is a moving part in your window AC. The only moving parts in an AC are the compressor (which compresses the refrigerant), and a fan (which blows the cold air into your room).\nSo, let’s check the compressor and the fan.\nHow to test To test and fix the rattling noise, you have to unmount your window AC. First, you can verify that your window AC rattles, by shaking it.\nWindow ACs are heavy, so, unless you’re a powerlifter, you likely won’t shake it in the classical sense. But you can place the window AC on one edge and tilt it back and forth.\n( Drain the water pan before )\nListen to whether you hear any loose parts clanging against each other. If you don’t, place your window AC on another edge and try again.\nIf you hear something, you know for sure, something is off.\nOpen the case of your window AC until you see the fan. Ideally, you should also open everything until you see the compressor.\nThen, turn it on. Be careful, since some window ACs have exposed power electronics. So, don’t get too close to them.\nListen to where the rattling in your AC comes from. There are now two possible outcomes:\nEither you hear the rattling, which helps you track down the noise until you find the faulty part.\nOr you don’t hear any rattling now that your AC stands on firm ground. This means that the cause is not a loose part, but a loose window setup.\nHow to fix Locate the broken part (if there is one). Likely it is the compressor or the fan. Usually, it’s easy to replace a broken fan. Just buy a similar fan online or in a hardware store and replace it.\nThis might need soldering. But aside from that, there are no difficulties.\nIf the rattling comes from your compressor, find out whether the compressor rattles as a whole, or whether it rattles from its inside.\nIf your compressor rattles as a whole, this means your compressor does not sit tightly. You might need to screw it in tighter. Or you can dampen the rattling with sponges you place below your compressor to hold it upright. Ideally, test this before you reinstall your window AC and make sure the compressor does not get hot.\nIf the compressor rattles from its inside, then I recommend just getting a new AC. You can sell your broken one.\nCheck out my review of my favorite air conditioners\n3. Buzzing noise Buzzing noises are always related to electronics. The classic buzzing sound comes from AC currents or voltages creating vibrations. Usually, the frequency of AC current is 50-60Hz, which, usually, causes a buzzing sound of a matching frequency in the power electronics if there is a fault.\nWhen your window AC is plugged into the wall outlet and running, the power from the wall outlet powers all the components of the window AC.\nHowever, when a component breaks, the power has nowhere to go, which creates the buzzing sound.\nOne usual cause of AC buzzing is when the compressor is stuck and does not move.\nThis can happen when you don’t use the AC for a long time. Or when bearings inside the compressor break.\nAnother similar cause could be a stuck window AC fan.\nTechnically, other broken parts can create a buzzing as well. But the compressor and the fan are the only moving parts in a window AC. So, they are the only parts that wear down over time.\nSo, they are the most likely points of failure.\nHow to test Turn on your window AC. Does it blow air? If yes, then the cause is not the built-in fan.\nIs the air coming out of your window AC cold? If yes, then the compressor likely also works.\nIf either no air comes out of your AC or the air coming out of it is not cold, then either your fan or compressor is broken.\nBut if your window AC is working fine and still creates a buzzing noise, then the issue must be in the power electronics.\nHow to fix Unplug your window AC and open its case. If your fan or compressor is the cause, check them for dirt. Dirt can clog them and prevent rotation. Clean your compressor and the fan.\nAlso, check the bearings of the fan and the compressor by manually trying to rotate them. They should turn smoothly.\nIf your fan’s bearings are broken, you can usually replace the fan. Just buy a replacement online or in a hardware store.\nReplacing compressor bearings is harder since disassembling a compressor requires special tools. And also, many manufacturers don’t sell replacement bearings.\nSo, you are pretty much left with either replacing the entire compressor or the entire window AC. ( I recommend the latter )\nIf the source of your buzzing is not the fan or the compressor, it is very likely somewhere in the electronics. If you are familiar with electronic repairs, have a look at the electronic circuitry and see where the buzzing originates.\nThen, visually check whether you see any blown or broken-off parts. If you manage to locate the issue, replace the part with an identical one (this might need soldering) and try running your window AC again.\nBuzzing oftentimes comes from the electronic power module\n4. Scratching noise Scratching noise is always a sign of aggressive friction. Again, since the only moving parts in a window AC are the built-in fan and the compressor, we only have to look for the cause there.\nElectronic circuitry obviously does not move and, therefore, does not scratch anything.\nOne unlikely, but possible, cause, could be small animals inside your window AC.\nLast summer I started noticing a scratching sound coming from our roof. I live on the top floor below a pitched roof. The first day I assumed it must be the wind.\nHowever, the scratching continued for days and I could not figure out what it was until I saw hornets flying in front of the roof window.\nSo, I punched against the wall, and a whole swarm of hornets flew out the roof!\nThe hornets were trying to build their nest in the wooden roof structure and scratching the wood, which was very loud considering how small those animals are.\nHow to test Does your window AC create a scratching sound even if it’s turned off? If yes, then assume there are bees, wasps, hornets, or whatever other nasty little beasts inside.\nYou can punch the window AC where the scratching noise comes from and see whether the scratching changes.\nIt might get stronger or stop entirely. Or a few flying friends might leave your AC to see what’s going on.\nIf the scratching noise only occurs when your window AC is running, then the issue is either in the compressor or the fan.\nHow to fix To remove insects, use an anti-insect spray. Carefully open the window AC’s case and see if there is a nest inside.\nDepending on the laws in your location you can remove the nest yourself. Either carefully remove it and relocate it to nature. Or spray-destroy the nest. It’s your choice.\nAnd some states and countries have laws prohibiting the self-removal of insect nests. But nobody can really enforce it.\nFor the future, make sure that all air filters are tight and have no holes, so the chance of insects entering your AC decreases.\nIf the scratching noise comes from your fan or compressor, you will have to replace the fan or compressor (as described in the previous sections already).\n5. Whistling or hissing noise Whistling or hissing noises are usually a sign of refrigerant gas leaks. But sometimes the whistling can also be a capacitor failure.\nLet’s have a look at both cases.\nGas leaks are, basically, gas passing quickly through a crack or a loose connection point in a pipe. The gas passing through the pipe creates a high-pitched whistling noise because it excites vibration in the pipe.\nIt’s like whistling with your mouth where you form a narrow air opening with your lips. The air passing through the opening excites vibration in your lips.\nCapacitors can also whistle when they break down or when other parts that they are connected to break. This can create high-frequency voltages which cause the capacitor to vibrate and whistle.\nRefrigerant duct leak inside an AC\nHow to test To test for these causes, open your window AC. Try to locate the whistling or hissing sound. Does it originate from the pipe or from the electronic circuit boards?\nHow to fix You can’t really quick-fix a leaking pipe. There are some AC leak sealant products online, but I would not trust them.\nIdeally, you should get a replacement pipe. To do it, you have to suck out the refrigerant, replace the pipe, and then recharge the pipes with refrigerant.\nTo me, this sounds very troublesome. And I’d for sure cause more damage than repair anything. At this point, your best choice is to just get a new window AC.\nWindow ACs cost less than a window AC repair. So, just replace it. Scrap dealers will usually happily buy your broken window AC!\nIf the cause of the whistling or hissing is a broken capacitor, then replace it with an equivalent replacement capacitor. This requires soldering. If you can’t solder, just get a new AC.\n6. Gurgling noise Gurgling noises are always a sign of bubbles moving around and popping in liquids. Gurgling noises can, therefore, originate in two components of your window AC.\nThe most likely cause is in the water drainage. Trapped air in the water ducts causes a gurgling sound.\nThe gurgling sound can also come from the refrigerant duct system. Either air somehow got into the ducts. Or the refrigerant causes a gurgling sound on its own (refrigerant gas in refrigerant liquid).\nHow to test Here you can only open your window AC’s case and try to listen to where the sound comes from.\nAlso, if you have a water drainage system, you can try to run your window AC without the water ducts attached. Instead, drain the water directly into a drain pan or a bucket.\nThis way you can tell whether the gurgling comes from the water drainage, or from somewhere inside the AC.\nHow to fix If the gurgling comes from the refrigerant ducts, you can hire a professional to vent the ducts. Also, check whether there is any leak in the ducts. The air came from somewhere. And it can’t magically pass through metal pipes.\nIf, on the other hand, the gurgling comes from the water system, drain all the water from the pipe. To be sure, also clean the ducts using a pipe brush.\nYou can use this drain brush (click here to view it on amazon). With 67 inches, it should be long enough for most window AC drainages (at least on the first floor). If you need any longer than that, get a longer drain brush, or disassemble your water drainage and clean the individual ducts separately.\n7. Clicking noise There are several possible things that can cause clicking in a window AC. Clicking always happens when one piece quickly snaps into another.\nThe clicking could be a relais switch in the electronics. Or it could be a mechanical part that clicks against another.\nI just boiled myself a kettle of water where I noticed two clicks: The electric kettle clicked once when the water boiled to shut off the heating. And it clicked a second time when it cooled down.\nThe temperature sensor is a bimetallic piece that bends and contracts upon temperature change. It could be that some ACs work similarly.\nAnyways: Clicking sounds always occur when some state in electronics change. Window ACs click, when the thermostat turns on or off the cooling.\nOne typical sound is that of a clicking relais switch. A relais is an electrical switch which, when you apply voltage, attracts a metal piece magnetically, which, in turn, snaps into the circuit and closes it.\nSo, usually, clicking sounds are normal and expected in a running window AC.\nOftentimes, temperature change in the AC’s parts causes them to click against each other as well. This is usually the case shortly after turning the AC on and shortly after turning it off (when the greatest temperature changes occur).\nThere’s one more possible source of clicking: Shortly after installing your window AC, the walls and the window frame and the structure holding the window AC in position have to adapt to the added weight.\nThis can cause an occasional click, even when the window AC is turned off.\nHow to test If the clicking only occurs when the window AC is running, it is likely only the switching sound of the thermostat. So, that’s nothing to worry about.\nEven after an hour of running, a window AC can click when it senses your room is cold enough and switches off the cooling.\nIf, on the other hand, your window AC clicks only shortly after turning it on or off, then the temperature changes cause the clicking sounds. That’s also nothing to worry about.\nLastly, if your window AC clicks when it is not running, the clicking can come from the added weight to the walls and window frame, which have to adapt.\nHow to fix You don’t have to do anything if your window AC only clicks when it runs. Clicking up until 5 minutes after shutting it off is acceptable as well since some parts need time to expand.\nIf your window AC keeps clicking while turned off after installing it, try adding some support to hold its weight. For example, you could place a pedestal, table, or stool below the window AC. And then add some books to fine-tune the height.\nOf course, that’s not a real solution, but it helps you figure out whether the lack of support structure is the source of the clicking.\nIf you find it is, add real support using this window AC support bracket(click here to view it on amazon).\n8. Crackling noise Crackling is usually a sign of parts contracting or expanding due to temperature changes. Whenever I turn my portable AC on, it crackles occasionally for a few minutes. This is due to the case and the internal AC parts adapting to the new temperature.\nCrackling can be very present in ACs since the internal components in an AC are exposed to large temperature gradients.\nThe cold air coming out of a window AC can be as cool as 64°F (18°C), while the back part, containing the compressor and the refrigerant gas which absorbs the heat, can be up to 104°F (40°C) or hotter (depending on the outdoor temperature).\nSo, whenever you turn on your window AC, you create this 40°F temperature difference. Some parts cool down (contract) and some parts heat up (expand).\nIt takes some time for the parts to settle and adapt to their new size, which the occasional crackling sound shows.\nYou find crackling sounds in all HVAC devices, not just ACs. All my space heaters crackle after I turn them on.\nSo, the crackling is nothing to worry about, except:\nThe crackling should only occur shortly after turning your window AC on. And it can occur after you turn your window AC off.\nBut if your window AC crackles continuously, there might be another issue.\nOne possible reason could be unstable components that change temperature frequently and don’t settle for an equilibrium temperature. This indicates an error in the thermostat control design.\nUsually, this happens with very cheap window ACs, or when the temperature sensor is badly calibrated or broken.\nHow to test Turn your window AC on. If your window AC crackles only shortly after turning it on or off, there is nothing to worry about.\nIf your window AC crackles continuously, the thermostat control mechanism is likely broken or poorly calibrated by the manufacturer.\nHow to fix You can’t really fix the crackling. Technically, it is not dangerous and, as long as your window AC works fine otherwise, the crackling is a mere inconvenience.\nIt just shows that the internal temperature is not stable and changes occasionally. If you are sick of your crackling window AC, get a new one!\nMost window ACs don’t crackle beyond a few minutes after turning on.\n9. Banging or knocking noise When there’s a banging or knocking noise coming from your window AC, beware! Aggressive banging or knocking is always a sign that some part broke off.\nA one-off knocking sound means that some part broke off. However, a continuous banging noise is a sign that a rotational part(either in the fan or in the compressor) broke off and keeps moving!\nContinuous banging is more dangerous than a single knocking sound.\nIn both cases immediately shut off your window AC and stop using it until you know exactly what the problem is.\nHow to test Shut off your window AC. Open the case and see whether you can locate any broken parts.\nHow to fix Inspect the area surrounding the broken part. Is it just a broken-off plastic fan blade? Then, you can replace the fan.\nHowever, if the entire compressor broke off and caused the banging sound because it jumped around inside the window AC case, destroying all the electronics, then you have no choice other than replace your window AC.\nQuality window ACs never produce banging or knocking sounds. Banging and knocking are signs of severe quality control issues. I recommend replacing your window AC with a quality brand product.\nWhat to do if your window AC still produces a noise? If you tried all the fixes and your window AC still produces a noise you are uncomfortable with, then I recommend just getting a new AC.\nWindow ACs are the most cost-effective ACs, and they won’t break the bank.\nI highly recommend this 10,000 BTU Midea window AC (click here to view it on amazon).\nMidea is a brand I (and many others) trust. This one won’t produce any weird noises anytime soon!\nPlease note that this model is a 10,000 BTU model. The BTU rating depicts the cooling power. For balanced and low-noise cooling, you should get the right size window AC for your room.\nA rule of thumb is to get 40 BTU of cooling power per square foot of room size. So, if your room is 200 square feet, then get the 8,000 BTU option. (40 BTU × 200 sq. ft. = 8,000 BTU).\nGetting the right size is important. A too-small window AC will not cool your room properly. And a too-large AC will cool it too much, then make a long pause, then cool again (so, it will switch the cooling on and off frequently, instead of supplying just the right amount of cold).\nAlso, powerful ACs tend to be louder.\nConclusion That’s it! I’ve listed all the noises I could think of and all the ways to fix them!\nIf you could not find your noise in the list, or you are not able to fix your AC noise issue, then just get a new AC.\nOftentimes, the time and effort it takes to repair something are not worth the cost of a window AC.\nSo, instead, you can just get a new device.\nThis way you don’t have to worry about something breaking anytime in the near future. And you have a new and fresh window AC for the next decade to come.\nBut if you manage to find a noise cause in your window AC that’s not listed in this article, please tell me your story via mail and I’ll be happy to include your experience here!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/window-ac-making-noise-fixes/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour window AC is making noise?

The answer is: Blue flame and infrared heaters are almost the same. Together, we’re going to myth bust blue flame and infrared heater differences.\nAnd after reading this article, you know exactly which heater to pick.\nQuick answer: Technically, infrared heaters are better than blue flame heaters since they radiate some of the heat into the room. Blue flame heaters emit hot air which rises upward. So, infrared heaters have a slightly better heat distribution. However, practically, blue flame and infrared heaters both produce radiant and convection heat. So, the main difference is looks. Heating output, gas usage, and efficiency are equal.\nTogether, we are going to test the heat output of my propane heater (which looks like an infrared heater). The surprising result: Gas-based infrared heaters often only look like infrared heaters, but output the heat in a very different way.\nSo, stick out until the end!\nWhy blue flame and infrared heaters are almost the same Blue flame heaters and infrared heaters are very similar. Let’s have a look at how blue flame and infrared heaters try to be unique but fail to do so.\nHow blue flame heaters work Blue flame heaters, as the name suggests, emit a visible blue flame. The flame heat the air, which, in turn, rises upward.\nSo, blue flame heaters are convection heaters. Convection heaters produce hot air. The hot air then mixes with the air in your room, which raises the temperature.\nAnd that’s already the point where most websites stop. Everybody online describes blue flame heaters as pure convection heaters, which is wrong.\nBlue flame heaters are not pure convection heaters. After all, there is a visible flame. And in a simplified way, you can say:\nWhenever there is light, there is heat.\nYou can prove this statement using thermodynamics (“All energy (including light) ends as heat”), or by touching a light bulb.\nNow, you might argue that light bulbs get hot because of the glowing wire inside. Yes. But the light coming from the light bulb is heat as well.\nThink of lasers, for example. Or the sun. Light of whatever color always ends up as heat.\nAnother example is greenhouses. The light passing through their transparent wall is not infrared, it’s visible sunlight. The sunlight bounces around inside and heats the greenhouse.\nIn fact, infrared is not hotter than other wavelengths (colors) of radiation.\nA blue flame radiates the exact same amount of heat as an equivalent infrared source.\nThe mental mistake we make is an association error. We subconsciously connect the color red with heat, because red heat is much more present on earth than blue heat.\nFor example, fire, lava, and glowing metal are all red. There are no natural examples of blue heat on earth.\nBut on a larger scope, the universe has a lot of alternative-color energy sources. For example, stars emit white or blue(ish) light. Also, burning propane gas (such as in a blue flame heater) is blue.\nAccording to Planck’s law, hot objects emit energy mostly in the infrared spectrum. But the hotter an object is, the bluer the light. Very hot objects radiate ultraviolet.\nSo:\nBlue flame heaters emit some of their heat as radiation and some of their heat as convection.\nWhat is different in infrared heaters? If blue flame heaters emit radiation and convection, then how do infrared heaters emit their heat?\nBasically, a gas-based infrared heater needs a heat source to heat up a ceramic heating tile. The ceramic tile then glows red and emits infrared heat.\nBut:\nInside an infrared heater, there is a blue flame that heats up the ceramic heating tile. So, a gas-based infrared heater is the same as a blue flame heater. The difference is that a ceramic tile hides the flame.\nThere is no other technical difference between blue flame heaters and infrared heaters.\nThey are identical!\nSo, which effect does the ceramic heating tile hiding the gas flame have?\nThe heating tile absorbs the energy of the flame. Usually, the ceramic heating tile has a large surface area because it is perforated.\nSo, the blue-flame heat distributes over the large heating tile surface area, which leaves you with a “cooler” red glow (instead of a hot blue glow).\nThe tilt of the heating tile and reflectors behind the heating tile help radiate the heat into the room.\nThe glowing ceramic heating tile increases the amount of heat radiating into the room. Whereas in a blue flame heater, most of the heat rises straight upward as convection.\nStill, the overall amount of heat both heaters produce is the same, given they consume the same amount of gas.\nThe biggest difference between infrared gas heaters and blue flame heaters is the direction of heat. In most cases, heat radiation into the room (instead of upwards) is preferable.\nMost of the heat leaves my propane heater through the top vents (even though it is supposedly an infrared heater)\nMythbusting Blue Flame vs Infrared Heaters Many people (including authors of large HVAC websites) totally misunderstand blue flame and infrared heaters. Or, to be fair, they get the basic points, but accidentally spread misinformation.\nI want to make up for this. So, here are 3 myths about blue flame vs infrared heater differences and whether they are really true or not:\n“Blue Flame heaters typically work better in insulated areas, while Infrared heaters may work better in un-insulated areas”\nBoth blue flame and infrared heaters have a fixed heat output. The insulation of the room does not matter at all.\nBut you can direct the heat better with infrared heaters. So, infrared heaters are indeed more practical for uninsulated rooms.\nBut in insulated rooms, both heaters are the same.\n“Blue Flame heaters may take longer to heat the room [\u0026hellip;], while Infrared heaters provide instant warmth [\u0026hellip;] to objects in its line of sight.”\nThat’s also wrong. You can prove this by lighting a lighter. There’s a flame. And a flame is hot instantly. Otherwise, the flame would not be a flame. Flames are ionized gas, which is, by definition, hot.\nSo, wherever there are flames, there is heat. Both blue flame and infrared heater get hot instantly. There’s no significant difference in heating speed.\nI’d even claim that blue flame heaters heat up faster since you can instantly feel hot air rising from the heater.\nInfrared heaters, on the other hand, need to heat up a ceramic heating tile and get it glowing hot. This takes a few seconds or up to a minute.\n“[Blue flame heaters] do not project the heat outward as much as Infrared heaters do”\nOf course, blue flame heaters do not “project heat outward” if you measure only the heat in front of the heater.\nBlue flame heaters emit their heat mostly upward. And they produce a lot of heat quickly. This is just another plain wrong statement.\nIt is equal to claiming that infrared heaters don’t project heat upward. The statement itself is true. But it masks the fact that the heat just goes in another direction.\nBoth heaters produce the same amount of heat.\nCase study: Is the Mr. Heater Buddy a blue flame or infrared heater? In this case study I want to show you why the distinction between the blue flame and infrared heaters is a bit unnecessary.\nI have a Mr. Heater Buddy heater. It is a portable propane heater with a ceramic heating tile.\nWhen you turn on the heater, you immediately see flames coming out of the perforated ceramic heating tile.\nAnd after a minute of heating, the Mr. Heater Buddy starts glowing like an infrared heater.\nMost portable propane heaters work like this.\nThey are a combination of flame heat and glowing heating tile radiant heat.\nSo, are they infrared heaters or blue flame heaters now?\nYou can’t clearly tell. On one side, there is a blue flame after turning it on, which vanishes (or becomes invisible) when the ceramic heating tile glows.\nThe Mr. Heater Buddy looks a lot like an infrared heater. But the majority of the heat leaves the heater up through the air vents.\nHowever, the heater also radiates some of the heat into the room from the glowing hot ceramic tile.\nSo, you can’t really distinguish between a blue flame and an infrared heater in this case.\nMost propane heaters are a mix of blue flame and infrared heater. They are interlinked.\nYou can’t get blue flame without infrared and vice versa.\nIf you buy a blue flame heater, some of the heat will radiate as infrared. And if you get an infrared heater, you need a blue flame to heat up the infrared heating element.\nOnly the ratio of convection and radiation heat varies between heaters. But you always get a mix of both worlds, and never only one.\nMr. Heater Buddy heaters heat upward (through convection) and from the front (through radiation)\nShould you pick a blue flame or an infrared heater? Which one is better now? Blue flame or infrared?\nThere is absolutely no technically relevant difference between blue flame and infrared heaters. In real heaters, you can’t even distinguish blue flame and infrared heaters clearly.\nYes, some heaters expose the blue flame, which makes you call them “blue flame heaters”. And some heaters expose an infrared heating element, which makes you call them “infrared heaters”.\nBut this is just name-calling. And technically, both heaters deliver a mix of infrared and convection heat.\nIt does not matter whether you get a blue flame or infrared heater. It is more of a design preference.\nDo you prefer the look of a blue flame or the look of a glowing red hot heating element?\nI prefer the glowing look, so I picked an infrared propane heater.\nRecommended infrared propane heater My favorite infrared propane heater is this Mr. Heater Buddy heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt provides a lot of heat, feels sturdy and you can carry it everywhere. You can use it to heat your garage, workshop, RV, or also your living room, or bedroom.\nOf course, Mr. Heater heaters have an outdoor-ish look.\nSo, I recommend getting one for supplemental heat around and in your house. But I would not choose it as a primary heat source for my living room or bedroom.\nFor that, I’d prefer a better-looking blue flame heater.\nRecommended blue flame heater Blue flame heaters are more stylish. This Dyna Glo blue-flame heater (click here to view it on amazon) is wall-mounted.\nSo, it is perfect for indoor heating. Children or pets can’t tip over the heater. And it looks great.\nIt requires a little installation work for the wall mounting. But it’s no harder than installing any other wall-mounted things. You don’t need to install any ducts with this heater, since it is vent free.\nOf course, the Dyna Glo blue flame heater is not good for portable heating. But if you need to heat just one space, then it’s a great choice.\nYou can’t go wrong with it.\nConclusion Blue flame and infrared heaters are very similar. They don’t differ in heat output, propane usage, efficiency, or any other metric.\nUsually, blue-flame heaters are a bit more pricey. But that’s because they are mostly wall-mounted permanent heaters, whereas many infrared propane heaters are portable (and therefore smaller).\nTechnically, blue flame and infrared heaters are hard to distinguish. Both infrared and blue flame heaters emit a part of their heat as infrared radiation and the remaining part of heat as convection heat.\nThe only difference is the ratio. Blue flame heaters emit most heat as convection heat, which is just hot air. And infrared heaters emit most of their heat as infrared radiation.\nI am not even sure if that is even true. My “infrared” Mr. Heater Buddy looks like an infrared heater. But most heat is hot air going up through the air vents.\nProbably you can even say that most propane (or other gas) heaters are mostly convection heaters.\nIn the end, the kind of heat emission does not matter.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blue-flame-vs-infrared-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre blue flame or infrared heaters better?

When it comes to propane heater safety, everybody is claiming different things.\nIn this article, I am going to uncover propane heater safety myths and tell you only the facts that everybody agrees on.\nFor an experiment, I bought a propane heater, and actually tried to burn things. And I measured propane heater temperatures using a laser thermometer.\nBased on the measurements, you can tell what is and what isn’t a safe propane heater.\nQuick answer: The Mr. Heater Big Buddy and Big Maxx models are the safest propane heaters by specification. They have the most safety features and their design is ideal for heat distribution. However, real propane heater safety is up to you . You can safely use any propane heater if you use your reason and intuition. Accordingly, improper usage can burn your house down, even with the safest propane heater.\nRecommendation: Safest portable propane heater The safest portable propane heater is this Mr. Heater Buddy propane heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt outputs up to 9,000 BTU of heating power, which is almost twice as much as the average electric space heater\u0026rsquo;s output.\nThe Mr. Heater Buddy is the safest propane heater, because of its built-in tip-over protection, the built-in oxygen depletion sensor, and its design for ideal heat distribution.\nAlso, it has a built-in pilot light mechanism. In principle, a small test flame in combination with a special thermometer determines whether the propane burns properly. Only if the propane burn is ideal, the Mr. Heater Buddy opens the main gas valve.\nThe pilot light of a propane heater ensures a safe and efficient burn!\nThis makes an improper burn, which would cause toxic gas emissions, almost impossible. And it ensures that you don’t waste any propane gas to a low-efficiency burn!\nOf course, Mr. Heater Buddy heaters are not perfectly safe. Propane gas burns at very high temperatures over 3,000°F.\nSo, there is still an open flame, which can ignite things. And the air leaving the heater is really hot.\nBut that’s the safety downside of all gas-based space heaters. Mr. Heater does a very good job at safely distributing the propane flame heat.\nWith a portable propane heater, you can’t go any safer than a Mr. Heater Buddy.\nIf, however, you don’t need a portable propane heater, then a fixed and vented propane heater might be for you:\nSafest large propane heater (electricity and installation required) Technically, vented propane heaters are even safer than that. Vented propane heater heaters never emit any gases into your living space.\nOne downside of vented propane heaters is the installation. You can’t really bring them with you anywhere. And you can’t store them away to be used in an emergency, since they usually take up a lot of space.\nIf you want to get the absolute safest propane heater, then get this Mr. Heater Big Maxx vented propane heater(click here to view it on amazon).\nThe Mr. Heater Big is a fixed heater. You can floor, wall, or ceiling-mount it wherever you like. Once mounted, it never tips over (obviously), which eliminates one of the biggest causes of space heater fires.\nThe heating element is fully hidden inside the large metal case. This is a significant difference from most portable heaters where the heating element is glowing hot red and you usually also see a flame.\nVisible flames always indicate that the heater can potentially burn things.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Maxx has built-in overheat protection, which turns off the heater when it gets too hot.\nPlease note that the Mr. Heater Big Maxx needs electricity to run! (115V AC)\nSo, you can’t run it independently of the electric grid and it likely won’t work in an outage.\nWhich propane heaters are NOT safe? Two types of propane heaters are not safe for indoor use at all.\nThe first type of unsafe propane heater is a torpedo heater. Torpedo heaters look like cannons that emit large flames. They get very hot. And usually, they are used in construction, eg. to heat large buildings in the cold season.\nThe other unsafe type of propane heater is a tank top heater. Tank top heaters are propane heaters that you mount directly on a tank top.\nThey are usually very lightweight, small(ish), and can emit a lot of heat.\nHowever, because they are so simple, they oftentimes don’t have any good safety mechanisms. Also, the propane flame is suspiciously close to the propane bottle. So, if a tank top heater ever ignites something, it is in (very) close proximity to the propane tank. And you don’t want a tank exploding in your home.\nFrom these two types of heaters, you can, however, learn what safe propane heaters should not have: A safe propane heater should never emit large flames. And, a safe propane heater should be able to run at a distance from the propane tank (connected with a hose).\nWhy you might not need the safest propane heater So far, you’ve learned about two very safe propane heaters, the Mr. Heater Buddy (portable) and the Mr. Heater Big Maxx (vented).\nThe vented Big Maxx model is significantly safer than the Mr. Heater Buddy heater. But you might not even need a heater that safe.\nFirst, the safety comes with a price. The Big Maxx vented heater is almost 4x the price of a Mr. Heater Buddy.\nYes, it provides a lot more heat than a Mr. Heater Buddy. But in most living spaces, you never need that much heat anyways.\nThe question you need to ask yourself is: “Do I need the safest or a safe propane heater?”\nIf you need the safest propane heater, then you will have to deal with the following drawbacks\nInstalling a vent through a wall or through the roof Paying a higher price (~$400 instead of ~$100) Relying on electricity (for built-in fans, safety features, and thermostat control) The absolute safest propane heaters never work without electricity, since their safety features (such as overheat protection, and fans distributing the heat) need electricity.\nIf you are looking fo r the safest propane heater for electricity outages, you can’t really pick the safest propane heater in general. Instead, you will have to get a portable propane heater without electric safety features.\nThese are completely fine. They are just not as safe as your wired, mounted, and vented propane heater (which fails in an electricity outage).\nIf, on the other hand, you need a propane heater for electricity outages, or for heating off-grid, you have to get a portable propane heater.\nAnd the Mr. Heater Buddy series heaters are the best heaters in this domain since they have built-in mechanical safety mechanisms.\nThe built-in tip-over protection works fine when you rattle your Mr. Heater Buddy. It just does not work as smoothly as the ones in electrical space heaters (which turn off as soon as you lift them off the ground or when you tilt them slightly).\nWhat makes a propane heater safe? The safety of propane heaters is based on three pillars: The built-in safety features, the heater’s design, and the way you use your propane heater.\nSafety features Propane heaters come with only few safety features built-in. Usually, you get a tip over-protection. And for larger propane heaters with an electric thermostat, you also get overheat protection.\nAlways get a propane heater with a pilot light. That’s the small blue test flame that the propane heater uses to determine whether the gas burns properly.\nAlso, the pilot light ignites the gas coming from the main gas line. Without the pilot light, you would have to ignite the main gas line gas directly. If that fails, you would have a lot of flammable propane gas floating around in your room.\nWithout the pilot light, you also risk incomplete gas combustion or inefficient burn. Most propane heaters, however, have a pilot light built-in.\nSome propane heaters (such as the Mr. Heater models) even come with a built-in oxygen depletion sensor that shuts off the heating when it senses lacking oxygen in your room.\nHeat distribution To eliminate the risk of overheating, most space heaters have an electric overheating protection. Portable propane heaters don’t have such protection, since they work completely without electricity.\nSo, how do propane heaters ensure they don’t overheat?\nThere’s no 100%-fail safe method to make overheating impossible without an overheat-protection mechanism. However, propane heaters use their design to reduce the risk.\nTo reduce the chance of overheating, engineers design propane heaters such that they distribute all the heat away from themselves.\nThe heat from the propane flame goes in two directions: The hot air rises upward. And the radiant heat leaves the front side of the heater.\nSafe propane heaters distribute their heat over a large angle\nAlmost no heat reaches the back of the heater, since the flow direction of the propane gas is forward. So, the ceramic heating panel (where the flames come out) heats up on the front and protects the backside.\nSince heat always rises, the bottom of the heater is also overheating-safe.\nThe areas where heat escapes are fully open and there are no obstructions for heat to leave the heater.\nWithout any obstructions, a propane heater can not overheat.\nPropane heaters quickly move heat away from themselves, which reduces the risk of overheating. Case meltdown or a gas line ignition are highly unlikely.\nProper usage Nothing has a greater impact on propane heater safety than how you use your propane heater.\nPeople are looking for the safest heaters, but are totally forgetting about the greatest cause of failure: themselves.\nYou can use a heater with the worst specifications, purchased directly from a shady garage sale, likely over 20 years old, with cracks and dents all over its case.\nAnd still, if you use the heater reasonably, you can make it the safest heater. A propane heater’s safety depends entirely on the way you use it.\nAccordingly, you can buy the safest heater on the planet, with all kinds of safety features, overheat protection, tip-over protection, kid-throwing-baseballs-at-heater protection, etc.\nAnd still, if you use that propane heater to heat yourself sitting by the assembly line of a fireworks manufacturer, you are literally asking to blow things up.\n(Of course, except if the heater has a built-in fireworks-protection mechanism).\nThe same is not only true for propane heaters but all other things in life.\nPeople are looking for the safest car. But it makes much more sense to look for any reliable car and then practice driving properly. The safest car is worth nothing without a safe driver.\nThe safest propane heater is pointless without a safe user.\nHow to make any propane heater safe Now we get to the most important learning of this article. You don’t get the safest heater. Instead, become the safest heater user.\nYour heater does not care about your family or your house. When it ignites something, your heater won’t stop heating.\nBut you care. So, you have to know how to safely operate a propane heater.\nI don’t want to make this (yet) another list of things to do to make your propane heater safe.\nMany websites write about these things. Here’s a quick summary:\nLeave enough space around your propane heater Place your propane heater on an elevated surface (a table, or furniture) if kids or dogs are around Always face your heater into the room, never along the walls or even toward the walls Vent your room occasionally (once every 2 hours). Propane combustion uses up oxygen and creates water vapor. Get the vapor out of the room and refill the oxygen levels. Well…\nThese things all make sense. But when you read them, you usually think “that’s obvious”.\nThat’s because all humans (including you) already have a built-in understanding for safety. Otherwise, the human race would have had a hard time during evolution.\nSo, safety tips always sound dull and boring. We always kind of know them already. And when you don’t already know a specific tip, you still feel like you did not learn something new.\nFor the last hundreds of thousands of years, humans live with fire. They learned to ignite fireplaces, keep them burning, and keep their family safe.\nRely on your primeval fireplace safety instinct. You intuitively know where to best place your heater, on which setting to run it, and whether you should run it around your kids (or pets).\nFireplace (and thus propane heater) safety is deeply ingrained in your brain.\nIt is very different from safety in physics or chemistry, where you have to understand the technology to tell whether you need to wear goggles. These are new findings.\nHowever, fireplace safety is a part of you.\nSo, I want to close up this article by saying this:\nAny propane heater can be the safest propane heater if you use reasoning. You don’t need to buy a specific product.\nConclusion The safest propane heaters (by specs) are the Mr. Heater Buddy and Big Maxx models.\nIf you don’t already have a propane heater, then I highly recommend getting either of them.\nThe Mr. Heater Buddy is much easier to use. It does not need installation, or electricity and costs much less.\nThe Big Maxx heater has a few additional safety features, and it combines with your home’s AC system.\nPersonally, I use propane heaters just as a backup heat source. So, I prefer the Mr. Heater Buddy. In an electricity outage, it is unbeatable.\nIf, however, you look for a main heat source, then the Big Maxx is the better choice.\nBoth heaters are very safe.\nTrue propane heater safety, however, depends on the owner. You can safely use the trashiest propane heater if you use reasoning and intuition. Fire intuition is a part of humans. We are the only species that are able to handle fire.\nOn the other hand, you can unsafely use even the safest propane heater, if you run it close to explodable or ignitable materials.\nThe safest propane heater is you.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/whats-the-safest-propane-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhat is the safest propane heater?

Many use Mr. Heater Buddys (and other models) as their primary outdoor heat source.\nThey are great in cabins, RVs, and in workshops. But can you use a Mr. Heater in your tent?\nIn this article, we will check whether Mr. Heaters can ignite or melt tent walls and whether they emit carbon monoxide. And of course, we will check whether it’s possible to run a Mr. Heater for a full night in a tent.\nQuick answer: Mr. Heater Buddy and Big Buddy heaters are only safe to use in \u0026gt;3-person tents. For smaller tents, you should get the Little Buddy heater. Mr. Heater propane heaters are safe to use in a tent of adequate size. Never use them in a crowded tent. They can theoretically ignite or melt the tent walls. So, make sure to be careful. Mr. Heater propane heaters will not emit carbon monoxide inside a tent.\nIn this article, I measured the temperatures my Mr. Heater Buddy outputs and how they compare to tent wall melting and ignition temperatures!\nTo save you some time, here’s the quick result.\nWhich heater is good for which tent size? Which Mr. Heater you can use for your tent mainly depends on the tent size. Here’s a quick summary:\nTent size****Best Mr. Heater propane heater\u0026gt;2-person tentMr. Heater Little Buddy\u0026gt;3-person tentMr. Heater Buddy\u0026gt;5-person tentMr. Heater Big Buddy\nCan a Mr. Heater ignite a tent? Whether a Mr. Heater can ignite or melt a tent wall depends on two things: The temperature of the air leaving a Mr. Heater propane heater, and, of course, the ignition or melting temperature of tent walls.\nLet’s have a look at these things:\nHow do Mr. Heaters distribute the heat? Mr. Heaters have a very special heat distribution. They look like infrared heaters because of the glowing ceramic tile, which acts as the heating element.\nInfrared heaters radiate the heat in one direction. So, an infrared heater will heat only the things in front of them.\nHowever, Mr. Heater Buddy heaters only look like infrared heaters, but they are mainly convection heaters.\nConvection heaters are heaters that emit heat as hot air, rather than radiation.\nThe hot air coming from a convection heater always rises straight to the top (except if there is a built-in fan in the heater). Most Mr. Heaters don’t have built-in fans. Which I like a lot, as this reduces noise and maintenance.\nMost of the heat from a Mr. Heater Buddy heater rises upward through the top vents.\nThe burning ceramic tile only creates the illusion of an infrared heater.\nI’d estimate that Mr. Heater Buddy heaters emit 70% of their heat as convection and 30% as radiation.\nThis means that most of the heat rises straight up to the tent walls or roof.\nIf you place your Mr. Heater in a tight corner, the tent walls can heat up quickly.\nWhich temperatures do tent walls withstand? A lot of engineering goes into making tent walls. They have to be lightweight, water and windproof.\nI assume that the light weight makes tent walls especially prone to fire. You could argue that tent walls are very dense (to repel water and wind). However, tent walls are very thin. So, they heat up quickly!\nTent walls are made of the following materials.\nMaterial****Ignition temperatureCotton410°F ( 210°C)Canvas410°F (210°C)Nylon624°F (329°C)Polyester842°F (450°C)\nThese are the ignition temperatures of different materials when you ignite them through kindling.\nThe autoignition temperature is the temperature at which different materials catch flame on their own.\nThe autoignition temperature of cotton is 764°F (407°C). Canvas is made of cotton, so its autoignition temperature is the same.\nPolyester starts melting at 810°F (432°C). And Nylon melts at 516°F (269°C).\nSince you usually don’t ignite your tent on purpose, the autoignition and melting temperatures are important.\nAnd as you can see, most tent materials start failing in some way around 400°F. Except for Polyester, which withstands higher temperatures.\nHow hot do Mr. Heater Buddy heaters get? Now to find out whether Mr. Heater Buddy heaters can ignite a tent, let’s have a look at the temperatures they emit.\nThe ceramic heating tile of a Mr. Heater Buddy gets well over 1,100°F. I used a laser thermometer to measure the temperature of my Mr. Heater, and this is the temperature reading I got.\nThe measurement is, however, off, since this is the end of the measuring range of my thermometer. So, the heating tile is likely significantly hotter.\nA blue propane flame burns at 3,596°F (1,980°C). So, that’s the maximum temperature you are theoretically able to measure in a Mr. Heater Buddy.\nHowever, since the ceramic tile absorbs the propane flame heat and distributes it via convection and radiation, the heat leaving the Mr. Heater is lower than that.\nIn very close proximity to the Mr. Heater (e.g. right in front of the ceramic heating tile and the air vents on top), you can measure temperatures of \u0026gt;800°F.\nMy Mr. Heater Buddy gets hot enough to burn paper! So, it can definitely melt tent walls if they get too close.\nThis is enough to ignite or melt tent walls that are close to the Mr. Heater.\nThe table below lists whether you can safely use your Mr. Heater in a tent or not:\n**Tent size****Can you use Mr. Heater?**1 person tentno2 person tentyes (Little Buddy)3 person tentyes (Buddy)5 person tentyes (Big Buddy)\n1 and 2 person tents usually don’t have enough space to run a Mr. Heater.\n3 person tents barely have enough space to run a Mr. Heater. So, you can theoretically use a Mr. Heater in a 3-person tent. But you should be extra careful because the space is getting very tight.\nYou can safely use a Mr. Heater in a 3-person tent if only 2 people are present in that tent.\nCan you run a Mr. Heater overnight in a tent? Yes, you can run a Mr. Heater overnight in a tent. However, make sure that your tent is large enough for your Mr. Heater to have enough space.\nMr. Heaters get very hot and, therefore, you need to have a tent with enough space for the heat to distribute before it reaches the walls and tent roof.\nAnd additionally, run your heater on the lowest setting to get the longest heating duration.\nUnfortunately, Mr. Heater Buddy heaters only last 5.4h on the lowest setting on a 1-pound bottle .\nSo, Mr. Heater Buddy heaters don’t last for a full night of sleep.\nTo heat for a full night, you either need two 1-pound propane bottles. Or you need to bring a larger tank.\nDo Mr. Heaters emit carbon monoxide in a tent? Mr. Heater Buddy heaters do not emit carbon monoxide in a tent. They can only theoretically emit carbon monoxide in perfectly insulated rooms that lack oxygen.\nHowever, a tent always has air gaps. And tent walls oftentimes also allow air to pass.\nMr. Heaters can only emit carbon monoxide in fully-sealed plastic wall tents, where no oxygen can enter.\nYou should never sleep in such a tent anyways.\nIn every regular tent, you don’t need to worry about carbon monoxide production.\nPhilosophy: Should you use a propane heater in a tent? Running a Mr. Heater propane heater in a tent is not safe. If it was safe, you would know and you would not have to read this article.\nI approach problems like this the following way:\nWhat are the risks and benefits of running a Mr. Heater in a tent?\nThe best possible outcome is that you spend a cozy night in your tent. The worst possible outcome is that you die in a tent fire. The mega-worst case is that you die and you cause a wildfire at the same time.\nSo, the risk-benefit ratio is a bit off. You risk lives for your own luxury.\nBecause of that, I generally recommend preferring warm clothes and a good sleeping bag over heaters.\nA good sleeping bag is a one-off expense. You buy it once and it lasts you for many years, likely even decades.\nAnother thought:\nDoes your life depend on the tent? You are looking for a heater to use in your tent because you are about to spend a (very) cold night.\nCold nights can be life-threatening.\nWith a heater, you risk burning your tent. So, especially when you need your tent for multiple nights, you should not bring a heater with you.\nImagine you’re going camping in cold Alaska. After a long flight, you spend your first night somewhere in the wild. You turn on your heater and it melts a hole into the tent wall.\nNice…\nNow, you are left with a tent that lets cold air in for the rest of your trip. And there’s no going back.\nIf you really depend on the tent, don’t risk it.\nIf you are spending a chilly spring or summer night in your tent not too far from home (or at least in your own country), then go for it and use a Mr. Heater Buddy in your tent.\nSince you don’t really depend on your tent, you can risk losing it.\nRecommended heater for tents Now, before you leave for your camping trip, get the right Mr. Heater model!\nMr. Heater Buddy heaters are too big for 2-3 person tents. And they use up a lot of propane.\nInstead, use the Mr. Heater Little Buddy (click here to view it on amazon) for tent heating!\nIt is strong enough to keep your tent warm at night, and small enough to be used in small tents.\nAdditionally, the heating head is angled at a 45° angle. So, the heat does not rise up the tent walls and melts through them, but it moves along the inner shape of the tent!\nThis reduces the risk of burning holes where you don’t want them.\nThe running time of a Mr. Heater Little Buddy is 5.6h on a 1lb propane bottle.

(Fact checked)"},{"content":"Are Mr. Heater Buddy heaters any good? Everybody recommends Mr. Heaters all the time. So, I bought one.\nTogether we will have a look at how good they really are.\nI am going to be extra critical in this article and pay attention to all the fine-grained details that other websites leave out.\nLet’s uncover the truth about Mr. Heater!\nQuick answer: Mr. Heater Buddy heaters are not good for everyone. They get over \u0026gt;1,000°F. Their protection grid can’t prevent fire. And on a 1-pound propane bottle, a Mr. Heater lasts only for 5.4h on the lowest setting. So, they don’t last a full night unless you bring a larger propane tank.\nHowever, these issues are present in all propane heaters with the same heat output.\nMr. Heater Buddy heaters don’t have any moving parts, which makes them last for decades. They need minimal maintenance and are very easy to fix (no electronics). Buddy heaters are solid and don’t have any easy-to-break parts.\nI own a Mr. Heater Buddy, so this whole article is a case study. I even did an indoor fire experiment (further below in the article).\nAfter reading the whole article, you’ll know exactly whether a Mr. Heater Buddy will be of use to you or not.\nAt the end of this article, you will find a table with different activities and whether a Mr. Heater Buddy is good for the respective activity or not.\nWhy Mr. Heater Buddy heaters might not be for you Mr. Heater Buddy heaters are not for everyone. They have a few drawbacks, which we will look at in this section.\nDon’t worry. Instead of just telling you about issues, I am also going to present you solutions for the respective issues!\nHeat distribution Mr. Heater Buddy heaters look like infrared heaters, but actually, most of their heat goes up the top air vents. So, they emit hot air which rises straight upward.\nOf course, the front heating panel glows hot red, so there is some infrared radiation. But most of the heat leaves the heater in form of hot air.\nOK… But why is this important to know?\nThe heat distribution of a space heater is important when you want to use it in large rooms, or outdoors.\nInfrared heaters, for example, emit most of their heat as radiation. So, you can point an infrared heater at yourself, and you feel warm, no matter the size of the room.\nConvection heaters (which work by emitting hot air), however, heat the entire room.\nIf you need an outdoor heater, convection heaters are pointless.\nMr. Heater Buddy heaters are a mix of infrared and convection heaters. The front heating panel emits infrared radiation. And the top vents emit convective heat.\nA Mr. Heater propane heater directs almost no heat to the floor (which is good). Most of the heat escapes through the top vents.\nWhen you initially turn on your Mr. Heater Buddy, it immediately emits hot air (convective heat). But it takes some time for the heating panel to heat up. Only then you will also feel some infrared heat.\nFor me, this heat distribution was unexpected, since Mr. Heater Buddy heaters look like infrared heaters.\nThat’s however, not a problem as long as you use your Mr. Heater Buddy heater indoors, in RVs, in a cabin, or in a tent.\nIf, however, you go for outdoor activities in open spaces, expect to waste a lot of heat energy.\nExamples are heating an open perch while hunting, heating your seat by the side of the river while fishing, or heating guests at an outdoor party.\nWhat’s a better way to portably keep warm in open spaces? Mr. Heater Buddy heaters are perfectly fine for heating indoors and other closed spaces (RVs, cabins, tents, closed perches).\nThey don’t work well when you heat open spaces because a lot of heat is lost as hot air which the wind carries away.\nTo heat open outdoor spaces, I recommend using a propane heater with a larger infrared component, such as a patio heater. Or, if you need a portable heater, then I recommend investing in good clothes, and insulation for your seat. And you can get this pack of 40 hand warmers (click here to view it on amazon).\nHandwarmers are a lot more energy efficient than propane heaters since they rely on conductive heat transfer (which is heat transfer through touch).\nSafety Another issue with Mr. Heater Buddy heaters is their safety. Of course, indoor propane heaters are not the safest kind of space heaters.\nAnd this has nothing to do with the Mr. Heater Buddy specifically. It’s just a downside of propane heaters you should be aware of before buying.\nMr. Heater Buddy heaters have exposed heating elements. The heating panel of a Mr. Heater Buddy heater is a perforated ceramic tile.\nThe holes let burning propane pass through. Each hole emits its own tiny flame. All of those flames add up and heat the ceramic tile.\nIt gets so hot that my laser thermometer showed an “out of range” error.\nThis means they are at least 1,000°F hot.\nA metal grid protects the heating panel. But the metal grid itself gets incredibly hot as well. I can’t touch it without burning my fingers.\nThe front of the Mr. Heater’s metal grid even reads “CAUTION HOT”. But, unfortunately, anyone who needs this info, such as kids and pets, can’t read.\nSo, the metal grid does not seem to protect from the heat at all. Yes, I can’t touch the flames easily. And I can’t easily grill a sausage on the ceramic heating tile.\nMy point is, however, that you can still easily burn your fingers. And you can still easily ignite objects around you.\nLet’s do an experiment:\nCan a Mr. Heater Buddy ignite something? I turned on my Mr. Heater Buddy and held a piece of paper at the metal safety grid.\nInitially, the paper did not catch fire, because the heater was not hot enough yet.\nBut after a minute, the paper caught fire!\nI tried different positions around the heater. And the front-top part of the heater seems to be the most dangerous.\nThis makes sense since that’s where the propane flame rises.\nMy Mr. Heater Buddy gets hot enough to ignite paper!\nSo, it’s very important that you don’t use your Mr. Heater Buddy in tight places. In this case, I think about tents. If you place a Mr. Heater Buddy in the corner of a tent (under a tilted tent roof), then I guarantee you it will burn a big hole into your tent.\nInstead, you should always place your Mr. Heater Buddy where there’s plenty of space for the heat to distribute.\nYou should leave at least 2 feet of space in front and 2 or 3 feet of space on top of a Mr. Heater Buddy.\nWhat’s the point of the metal grid? So, if Mr. Heater Buddys can ignite things, even though there’s a safety metal grid, then what’s even the point of that grid?\nIt only makes a Mr. Heater Buddy appear safer. But actually, it does not change anything.\nAnother reason there is a grid is that it’s a great spot to mount add-ons, such as a cooking grate.\nOf course, the grid is still a safety feature.\nBut it’s just not as capable a safety feature as it initially appears to be.\nI think the main point of the metal grid is to protect the perforated from blocking. For example, imagine you run your Mr. Heater buddy next to your sofa where you’re watching a movie.\nSuddenly, your snack bowl drops and, coincidentally touches the perforated ceramic heating tile. Because your snack bowl is plastic, it immediately melts and blocks the propane flame.\nThen, you pull the plastic off the heating panel and the Mr. Heater explodes (because so much unburned propane accumulated around the extinguished heating panel area). When you lift the melted plastic, some holes catch fire which causes a chain reaction.\nThe point of the metal grid is to prevent uncontrolled gas extinguishing followed by reignition.\nCarbon monoxide emissions Another potential safety issue with Mr. Heater Buddy propane heaters is possible carbon monoxide emissions.\nThere was, however, an experiment where someone placed his Mr. Heater Buddy heater in a closed RV and let it run for 2 hours.\nThe carbon monoxide levels were zero, which is very surprising since propane combustion burns oxygen.\nWhen there is a lack of oxygen in a closed room, carbon monoxide forms.\nThis problem, is, however, oftentimes only a theoretical one. Carbon monoxide only forms if the propane reaction does not have access to any oxygen. If there is no oxygen in the air, in your room, the burn sucks additional air into your space.\nIt does not matter whether you are in a closed room, RV or tent. There are always air gaps for oxygen to enter.\nSo, unless you intentionally block all the air gaps in your space, your Mr. Heater Buddy won’t emit carbon monoxide.\nWhat can you do to improve a Buddy heater’s safety? The metal grid does not protect from fire. And you also can’t guarantee that your Mr. Heater Buddy does not emit carbon monoxide.\nThe only real protection against these things is you. You have to reasonably use your propane heater.\nAlways leave space in front and on top of the heater. And, to prevent carbon monoxide production, vent your room occasionally.\nAlso, you should get a carbon monoxide detector you trust. I recommend this Kidde carbon monoxide alarm (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt’s a one-off expense. But it can save lives!\nHeating Duration Mr. Heater Buddy heaters are designed for portable use. In really portable scenarios, such as hiking, camping, hunting, fishing, and especially when it’s just a one-day trip you usually don’t bring large gas tanks with you.\nInstead (and that’s what a Mr. Heater Buddy is designed for), you use it with a 1-pound propane bottle.\nA Mr. Heater Buddy lasts for only around 2.4 hours on such a one-pound propane bottle on the high setting (9,000 BTU/h). That’s not a lot.\nOn the medium setting (4,000 BTU/h), a Mr. Heater Buddy lasts for 5.4 hours on a 1-pound propane bottle.\nOf course, that’s not the fault of the brand Mr. Heater. That’s just basic physics. If you want to get a specific amount of heat from propane, you have to burn a specific amount of propane gas.\nStill, the heating duration of Mr. Heater Buddy heaters is not very good.The biggest drawback is, in my opinion:\nOn such a 1-pound propane bottle, a Mr. Heater Buddy lasts up to 5.4h.\nA Mr. Heater Buddy does not last a full night on a 1-pound propane bottle.\nYou don’t even need much heat at night. So, all Mr. Heater would have to do, is add a lower heat setting to the portable Buddy heaters.\nFor example, if there was a 2,000 BTU/h setting, then a Mr. Heater could last for 10.8 hours on a 1-pound propane bottle.\nThis would be a huge improvement for everyone who relies on a Mr. Heater to heat overnight.\nCurrently, you have to connect a bigger bottle (with a hose) to the Mr. Heater so you can heat for a full night without changing bottles.\nI am sure the Mr. Heater company is not ignorant of this issue. Likely, they can’t add this feature as you can’t guarantee a full propane flame at such low settings. But who knows! Maybe in the future, we will get low propane heater settings.\nOf course, Mr. Heaters last a long time on large 20lb tanks. But you have to bring these larger tanks everywhere you go.\nTarget market This leads to the next issue: The target market. What are the target customers of Mr. Heater propane heaters?\nMr. Heaters are marketed as portable propane heaters. However, as soon as you need real portable heat, such as for trekking, kayaking, and other multi-day activities, propane heaters are useless.\nFor these activities, investing in proper clothing and sleeping bags is much wiser. They don’t need any refueling.\nMr. Heater Buddy heaters are only suitable for semi-portable heating, such as cabins, RVs, or workshops.\nThese are places where you carry around your heater, and where you always have access to a larger gas supply.\nThis does not mean that Mr. Heater products are bad. It just means that they are partly marketed toward an audience that should better rely on other products.\nIncompatibility with UK and EU gas bottles Another downside of Mr. Heater products is their incompatibility with UK and EU gas bottles. It’s confusing when you buy a propane heater and your national propane bottles don’t fit.\nNow, you might argue that Mr. Heater heaters are US products.\nBut imagine buying a product from an overseas brand (such as a smartphone, a car, or whatever). Then, you expect it to fit your country’s standards. You want the plug and wall outlet to fit. And in a car, you want to have speed readings in miles per hour instead of kilometers per hour.\nInterestingly, Mr. Heater only sends out heaters compatible with US gas bottles.\nHow to make a Mr. Heater compatible with your gas bottle To make a Mr. Heater compatible you need an extra adapter to convert the US to your UK or European gas connector.\nOftentimes, a connector is included in the package. Vendors don\u0026rsquo;t want returns. But some vendors don\u0026rsquo;t care to include it. So, you have to get your own connector.\nThat’s not a real issue. But some people don’t know about it, get a Mr. Heater without an adapter and then wonder the first cold night in their RV why their propane bottle doesn’t fit the heater.\nWhy Mr. Heater Buddy heaters are great That was a lot of criticism! I really tried hard to find flaws with Mr. Heater propane heaters.\nStill, they are my all-time favorite portable propane heaters.\n( I hope it did not shine through until now )\nIdeally, you should be surprised now. At least, this was my goal.\nMr. Heater propane heaters are actually great heaters. And if you are looking to buy one, here are some very good reasons why they should be your first choice.\nMr. Heater Buddy heaters are very \u0026ldquo;round\u0026rdquo;, which improves impact resistance\nImpact-proof design The first aspect I want to highlight is a Mr. Heater Buddy heater’s design.\nThe Buddy heaters are around for a few decades and they remain mostly unchanged, even though everything changes around us continuously.\nMr. Heaters are a timeless product. They looked good 10 years ago and they will look good in 10 years.\nThere’s nothing fashionable about a Mr. Heater Buddy. So, it never ages.\nAnd on top of that, the design of a Mr. Heater makes sense.\nIf you have a look at a Buddy heater, you see that it does not have a single thin piece protracting from the heater body. It appears very round.\nAdditionally, all the parts, including the handles and the rounded “roof” covering the propane bottle are very thick.\nAs long as you use your Mr. Heater reasonably, none of the parts will ever break. They look and feel very solid and hard to damage.\nOf course, if you throw your Mr. Heater down a cliff, something might break. But that’s your fault.\nA Mr. Heater will easily survive table drops, accidental impacts, bouncing around in a driving RV, or sawdust exposure.\nNo moving parts to wear down Mr. Heaters Buddy heaters don’t have any built-in moving parts. Some space heaters have a built-in fan to distribute the heat.\nIn a Mr. Heater, nothing moves.\nAnd still, it is perfectly able to distribute the heat through convection and radiation.\nA heater that has no moving parts does not age. Moving parts cause friction. And friction wears down parts with time.\nAdditionally, moving parts tend to collect and compress dust over time, which can prevent heat distribution and reduce the perceived energy efficiency.\nIf you’ve ever cleaned an old desktop computer’s built-in fan, you know what I mean.\nMr. Heater Buddy heaters literally last for decades without breakdown.\nAt least, they don’t break down because of any parts breaking. The only thing that prevents a Mr. Heater from lasting forever is dust and dirt accumulation.\nBut this is also very easy to fix:\nEasy to fix and maintain Mr. Heater Buddy heaters don’t break down easily. And most of the time when your Mr. Heater does not light, it’s very easy to fix.\nSince Mr. Heaters doesn’t have any built-in moving parts, there is no breakdown due to friction. This, in turn, means you don’t have to maintain a Mr. Heater that much.\nThe only (frequently occurring) thing that stops a Mr. Heater from working is when the pilot light is clogged.\nThis can happen when oil accumulates in the pilot light gas line. The oil in the gas line oftentimes comes from large propane tanks. If you run your Mr. Heater propane heater without a gas hose filter, then after some time (it could be months or even years), the gas line will clog.\nAnd that’s not even the fault of the Mr. Heater company. If you blow oil from your gas tank (or also from the gas hose) into your Mr. Heater, you can’t expect it to continue working reliably.\nLuckily, you can prevent this problem very easily.\nIf you use a large gas tank, which you connect through a hose, then use this Mr. Heater Buddy and Big Buddy gas filter (click here to view it on amazon). The filter prevents oil buildup in your Mr. Heater.\nTo remove that’s already accumulated in your Mr. Heater’s pilot light, use a Q-tip with rubbing alcohol to clean the pilot light gas opening.\nThat’s about all the maintenance you have to do with a Mr. Heater!\nOf course, theoretically, other parts can break as well, but that’s very unlikely since they are not exposed to oil or friction.\nMaterial choice optimized for weight and safety The material choice of Mr. Heater Buddy heaters is ideal.\nThe middle section of a Mr. Heater Buddy heater is made of metal (I think it’s aluminum).\nThe side sections of a Mr. Heater is plastic.\nNow, you might say “Full metal is better!”. However, metal is heavy. So, to save weight, Mr. Heater uses it only where it is really needed.\nBecause metal withstands very high temperatures, the middle section needs to be metal. And because the sides are not exposed to high temperatures, they are made of plastic.\nAdditionally, the plastic protects the propane bottle (or propane hose) attached to the heater, since it insulates much better than metal.\nImagine running a full-metal propane heater and after a few minutes, all of the metal components get hot enough to blow up the propane bottle or gas line.\nPlastic does not conduct heat well.\nSo, the material combination of plastic and metal in a Mr. Heater is perfect.\nShould you buy a Mr. Heater Buddy? I told you a lot of negative and positive things about Mr. Heater Buddy heaters in this article. So, should you buy this Mr. Heater Buddy (click here to view it on amazon) now or not?\nI’d say this:\n**Location or Activity****Is a Mr. Heater Buddy good?**CabinyesRVyesIndoorsyesHigh-altitude road tripyesWorkshopyesGarageyesTrekkingnoKayakingnoBikepackingnoMountaineeringno\nThis table summarizes all the findings from this article in a “yes” or “no” answer.\nBasically, I recommend Mr. Heater Buddy heaters only in situations where you don’t have to carry the heater and the gas supply yourself.\nFor example, you can place your heater in a cabin, and occasionally get a gas tank refill by car. The situation is similar for RVing and other indoor use cases.\nHowever, as soon as you go for outdoor trips where you carry all of your belongings, don’t carry a Mr. Heater propane heater with you.\nIt does not work. Mr. Heater propane heaters are too large and heavy to carry around. And this does not even include the gas supply and gas refills in remote locations.\nConclusion Mr. Heaters are perfectly crafted portable propane heaters. They are easy to maintain and they last for a very long time.\nHowever, they are not the safest kind of heater. They get hot enough to ignite things.\nSo, use your Mr. Heater Buddy reasonably.\nI’d say as long as you’re using your heater reasonably and you don’t have small kids or pets around, Mr. Heater propane heaters are perfectly safe.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-mr-heater-buddy-heaters-any-good/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre Mr. Heater Buddy heaters any good? \u003cem\u003eEverybody\u003c/em\u003e recommends Mr. Heaters all the time.

(Critical Review)"},{"content":"Your space heater is smoking? Immediately unplug it from the wall outlet! Then, grab a tea (or whatever you like) and make yourself comfortable.\nAfter reading this article, you will know exactly what to do about your smoking space heater. We will check whether you should get a new one, and if not, how to fix the most likely causes of your space heater smoking.\nQuick answer: Space heaters usually smoke from the heating elements, the internal power electronics, the power cord, or the case. Smoking heating elements usually indicate dust. Clean them with rubbing alcohol. If smoke comes out the inside, then check the electronics for blown parts and replace them. Similarly, check your power cord for issues and replace it if necessary.\nLet’s go through each of the problems step-by-step!\nShould you get a new space heater? Smoking in a space heater is not a good sign at all. Something inside or outside the space heater went wrong.\nAnd you can’t continue running your space heater as it is, because eventually, your space heater will catch flames. Smoke is a messenger of fire.\nSo, should you just get a new space heater?\nWhether you should get a new space heater (without trying to fix the issue) is a very psychological question. Because, even if you manage to fix your space heater (using the tips I am about to give you), it could still be that you don’t trust your space heater to run safely anymore.\nSo, here’s my advice:\nIf you are a safety-oriented person and you run your space heater indoors where you potentially risk your family’s lives and your house (which is basically your entire existence), you should get a new space heater.\nMy personal favorite safe space heater is this Pelonis oil-filled radiator (click here to view it on amazon).\nOil-filled radiators are very family and indoor-safe. They normally never smoke since their heating elements are embedded in oil inside their large metal case.\nTheir surface temperature is 180°F at most, which is too low to cause smoke or fire.\nIf, however, you are good at electronics, and you trust yourself to fix the smoke issue, then continue reading!\nReasons and fixes for a space heater smoking Let’s have a look at the most common problems that cause a space heater to smoke. In addition, for each possible cause, I noted a way to test for that specific cause and how to fix it.\nDust or dirt on the heating elements If you don’t use your space heater often, dust settles on the heater. This is oftentimes the case in places where a lot of dust settles (for example in your living space), or in wood workshops where there’s lots of sawdust in the air.\nWhen you turn on your heater, the heating elements get hot enough to burn the sawdust, which causes the smoking.\nSpace heater heating elements get between 750°F and 850°F. Propane heaters get even hotter than that. So, any dust on them turns to smoke.\nHow to test: Wipe your finger across the space heater’s surface. Is there any dust?\nYou can also unmount the safety grid in front of your space heater’s heating elements and see whether the heating elements are dirty. Black stains on the heating elements are a sign of burned dust and dirt.\nHow to fix: Give your space heater a thorough wet wipe. If you find that some of the dirt does not come off, you can use rubbing alcohol. This gets rid of grease and oils that also cause smoking.\nFor hardly accessible spots you can use Q-tips with rubbing alcohol.\nHow to prevent it in the future: To prevent your space heater from accumulating dust and dirt in the future, you should put your space heater in a storage room when you don’t use it for a longer time.\nFor example, when the winter ends, you can store your space heater in a storage room until you need it again the next winter.\nYou should not keep your space heater in a busy place. Essentially, dust is a mix of dead skin and hair cells. So, keep your space heater away from people and pets if you don’t need it.\nBlown parts in the electronic circuitry Once, I worked in an electronics measurement devices factory where I repaired broken devices. One problem occurred over and over: When I plugged a device into the wall outlet, it started smoking.\nThe problems were always in the electronic circuitry. The most frequent issue is a short circuit, blown capacitors (which explode and smoke afterward), or burned resistors.\nIt might very well be that there is such an issue in your space heater’s electronics, which causes components to overheat and smoke. Luckily, this is easier to figure out than it sounds. Still, you need a bit of electronics skills.\nHow to test: Open your space heater’s case until you see electronic circuit boards.\nThere should be at least one circuit board with big capacitors and coils. That’s the power electronics component.\nThis component is the most error-prone since it converts large currents and voltages.\nVisually inspect this component and see if you see any burn marks, stains, or broken pieces. Oftentimes, it takes a few minutes to find the issue.\nIf you don’t see an issue with the power electronics circuit board, look for another circuit board (thermostat, front panel, etc.) and check for burn marks.\nAfter double-checking that your circuitry does not touch any conductors, you can even turn on your open space heater and see where the smoke comes from. You should, however, only do this if you are really familiar with electronics.\nAn electronic power module\nHow to fix: Most electronic circuitry issues are simple part replacements. Just identify the broken or blown part, and replace it with a matching one. You can find replacement parts online. For the replacement, you likely need a soldering iron.\nAfter replacing the part, turn on your space heater. Now, pay attention to whether this same part blows up again. If this happens, then the issue is not the blown part itself, but another part (likely a short circuit) that causes a higher current or voltage in your replacement part.\nThis case is a bit harder to troubleshoot.\nI suggest getting a multimeter and checking all capacitors and resistors for short circuits. Normally, capacitors and resistors should be a resistance to currents.\nCheck all coils (or inductances) for open circuits. Coils (inductances) should be very low resistances for currents.\nHow to prevent this in the future: You can’t really prevent electronic issues. The reason for electronic issues can range anywhere from aging to humidity inside the space heater.\nAll you can do is use your space heater properly. Store it in a dry indoor place.\nFaulty power or extension cord Maybe the smoking does not come directly from your space heater but from the power cord.\nIf you don’t plug the power cord firmly into the wall outlet, you unknowingly create a point of high resistance.\nAnd high resistances always heat up. In the worst case, the power cord or extension cord starts smoking and catches fire.\nAlso, if you use a cheap extension cord, it might be that its rating is too low for space heaters. Space heaters draw 12.5A of current. So, your extension cord has to be rated above that. Otherwise, you risk a cable meltdown.\nHow to test: Turn your space heater on again. See where the smoke comes from. If it comes from the space heater end of the power cord, then the connection to the space heater is faulty.\nElse, if the smoke comes from the wall-outlet, then the issue is either in the power cord, in the wall outlet, or in the connection point of both.\nHow to fix: If the space heater end of your power cord smokes, then you have to open your space heater and double-check that the power cord connects tightly to the power electronics. You can resolder the power cord and see if that resolves the space heater smoking.\nIf the smoke comes from the wall outlet, ensure that you plug in the power cord firmly. Also, you should cross-check with other heavy-duty devices whether that same wall outlet smokes. This way you can eliminate the wall outlet or the space heater as the cause.\nIf the space heater’s power cord is the cause, you can replace it with a new power cord.\nAlso, if you are using an extension cord and your extension cord is the cause, then you should get a new extension cord for space heaters.\nHow to prevent it in the future: The original cause of your space heater’s power cord smoking is likely that you either don’t connect it tightly to the wall outlet, or you bumped into the space heater and almost ripped off the power cord.\nOverstretching of the power cord can rip a few connection strands between the space heater and the power cord and cause a high resistance, which, in turn, causes smoking.\nCase material Space heaters that are made of cheap plastic materials can start smoking after a while once the material gets hot enough.\nEven cheap space heaters reach heating element surface temperatures of around 800°F. The difference between quality products and cheap products is not the heating, but the materials used and the finish.\nMost plastic materials melt between 250°F to 350°F. So, in a poor-quality space heater, it is just a matter of time before the space heater starts melting down.\nHow to test: You can usually tell by looking at a space heater whether it’s a good quality product or not.\nMost plastic space heaters are not that good. Of course, there are exceptions.\nTurn on your space heater. Does it smoke immediately? If it smokes immediately, then the issue is not the case material (since it needs time to heat up). If, however, it starts smoking only after a few minutes, then it is very likely that plastic is melting somewhere.\nDon’t panic and carefully check where the smoke comes from.\nHow to fix: You can’t really fix the material your space heater is made of. Well… technically, you can disassemble the entire heater and rebuild it with a new case of wood or metal. But that would take dedication.\nInstead, I recommend getting a new quality space heater. I think material-wise, the Dr. Infrared Heater (click here to see it on amazon) is the best heater.\nIt is made of solid real wood (which has an ignition temperature of over 1,100°F) and is, therefore, a lot safer than plastic space heaters.\nHow to prevent it in the future: Only use quality space heaters. Cheap space heaters can melt and catch fire quickly.\nCan you continue using a self-fixed space heater? Ideally, you should use your smoking space heater (after you fixed it) only in places where it can’t cause greater harm.\nSelf-repairs are if improperly done, dangerous. They create an illusion of safety where there is none.\nAlso, it might be that your repair did not fix the root cause of the smoking problem.\nFor example, when you replace a burned part in a space heater, the burned part itself might not be the cause. It could have been the power component sending too much power to that part.\nOr, if your case material melts, the root cause might not be the cheap material itself. It could also be the heating elements that get too hot because a temperature sensor is broken.\nSpace heaters are technically feedback loops: They heat, measure the temperature, and, based on the temperature, adjust the heat.\nSo, the smoking issue appears in one spot. But the root cause could be anywhere else in the heating feedback loop.\nAnd that’s the key reason why I suggest not using this space heater in important spaces anymore. The space heater already proved that it is able to catch fire. Since there is no guarantee you fixed the root cause of the problem, continuing to use the space heater is still inherently risky.\nIn all cases, you should get a new indoor space heater.\nYou can continue using the repaired space heater in a garage or workshop. There, test your space heater for a few weeks, or months.\nIf it still works, this indicates that you fixed the root cause of the smoking issue and you can use your heater indoors again.\nConclusion You can fix a smoking space heater yourself. Oftentimes, smoking is caused by dust and dirt, or an issue in the power electronics.\nYou can try to fix it yourself. After fixing it, use the fixed space heater only in safe places such as your garage or workshop.\nBetter burn down your garage or workshop than your house.\nIf your space heater works without problems for a few weeks, you likely fixed the root cause of the smoking.\nThen you can use your heater indoors again.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/space-heater-smoking-fixes/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour space heater is smoking?

Especially in emergencies, when there is no electricity and even central heating turns off, you need a backup heat source.\nIf you have a gas stove at home, then using it could be an option.\nIn this article, we’re going to check everything you need to know about emergency heating using your gas stove. And you’re going to learn about better (and more cost-efficient) alternatives to gas stoves.\nQuick answer: Yes, you can use a gas stove as a heater. To do it safely, monitor the blue flame color (which indicates the presence of oxygen) and vent your room occasionally. For better heat distribution and flame coverage, place a water-filled pot on the stove. However, you should only use a gas stove as a heater in an absolute emergency. If you are not in an emergency situation right now, prepare and get a portable propane heater as a backup heat source.\nCan you use a gas stove as a heater? Theoretically, yes you can use a gas stove as a heater. A gas stove is technically very similar to a gas heater. The main difference is, however, the lack of safety mechanisms.\nIn the end, a gas stove does the very same thing as a gas heater. The gas flame in a gas stove only heats a pot or pan instead of your whole room under normal circumstances.\nIn an emergency, such as an electricity outage, you can, of course, turn on your gas heater. In emergency situations, the most important goal is to stay alive.\nThen, it does not matter what people online say.\nHere’s one example of people online panicking:\n“No! Using a gas appliance improperly can cause it to take in too much oxygen from the air, leading to asphyxiation, or not enough oxygen, leading to carbon monoxide poisoning.”\nsalemil.us\nThe same website even claims that you can’t even use propane heaters indoors. Ridiculous.\nAs a heating-dedicated website, I can confidently say: That’s false!\nYou can safely burn propane indoors without raising carbon monoxide levels. All gases burn without carbon monoxide formation as long as there is enough oxygen in your room.\nWhat really matters is that the propane flame burns blue. This is a sign that the combustion has enough oxygen. This, in turn, means, that no carbon monoxide is created.\nIf running a gas stove as an emergency heat source really is this dangerous, then why is is safe to cook?\nCooking soup can also take 1-2h. If you don’t vent the kitchen during cooking, then what makes the cooking safer than heating?\nRight!\nThere is no difference.\nSafety issues with using a gas stove as a heater (and how to fix them) Using a gas stove in an emergency is not safe. In fact, there are several things that make using a gas stove as a heat source quite dangerous.\nIn this section, we will have a look at the most significant problems with using a gas stove as a heater. And, for each problem, I am going to tell you what you can do to solve it!\nNo oxygen depletion sensor Most gas stoves don’t have a built-in oxygen depletion sensor. An oxygen depletion sensor is a sensor that notices when the gas combustion lacks oxygen.\nIdeally, gas combustion should never lack oxygen. A lack of oxygen results in the formation of carbon monoxide and other toxic gases such as aldehydes.\nGas heaters, such as propane heaters, oftentimes have a built-in oxygen sensor that notices a lack of oxygen and, in turn, shuts off the heating.\nGas stoves usually don’t have these sensors and burn even if their oxygen intake is improperly adjusted.\nThis not only creates potentially toxic gases but also causes an inefficient burn. Gas burns most efficiently when the combustion process does not lack oxygen.\nSolution:\nYou can’t really change the fact that your gas stove does not have an oxygen depletion sensor. But you can be your own oxygen depletion sensor!\nThere are two things you should constantly do:\nMonitor the gas flame color. It should always be blue. A flame color change to yellow indicates an issue with combustion. If your flame turns yellow, double-check that the gas stove is clean (since dirt can also cause yellow flames). Then, adjust the oxygen intake until the flame turns blue again. Regularly vent your room. Since improper combustion can form carbon monoxide, you should regularly vent your room.\nAs long as the flame burns blue, the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is very small. Still, open your window regularly for a few minutes just to make sure. Listen to your body. Lack of oxygen can cause headache (small lack) and nausea (significant lack). If you notice any health-related issues, turn off your gas stove. The flame of your gas stove always has to be blue!\nNo tip-over protection Most portable gas heaters have a built-in tip-over protection. Now, tipping over is not really an issue for a big kitchen stove.\nBut you have to be careful with portable gas stoves. These can easily fall off the table and cause a fire, as they don’t stop burning.\nSolution:\nPlace your (portable) gas stove in a very safe place to minimize the likelihood of it dropping.\nAlso, place it out of reach for kids and pets.\nOpen flames The open flames of a burning gas stove are probably the most dangerous aspect of running a gas stove as a heater.\nOpen flames ignite things easily.\nSolution:\nYou can’t really avoid open flames in a burning gas stove. However, you can cover the flames.\nTo cover the flames, place a large metal pot filled with water on the stove. Put the lid on the pot and turn on the gas heater.\nNow, the metal pot hides the flames. And additionally, it helps distribute the heat.\nNo heat distribution Most gas heaters have a ceramic (or similar material) heating panel that the gas flame heats. This heating panel, in turn, starts glowing.\nThis, in turn, causes the heat to radiate into the room, instead of just rising straight up.\nGas stoves don’t have these built-in heating panels. Instead, they just emit flames that create hot air which rises to the ceiling.\nTechnically, heating panels don’t matter, because all heat will eventually distribute in your room.\nHowever, the perceived heat of gas heaters is higher, because they radiate the heat into the room. So, you feel the heat directly radiating at you.\nWith a gas stove, you only get warm air, with poor heat distribution.\nSolution:\nAs in the previous section, place a water-filled metal pot (with a lid on top), on your gas stove.\nThe pot absorbs the heat from the flames and distributes it over the large metal surface.\nTheoretically, you can also place a pot without water on your gas stove. But depending on the pot material and surface finish, this might damage your pot.\nI recommend filling it with water since it is a very good heat store.\nPortable propane gas heaters are a much safer backup heat source than gas stoves. Always have one around!\nWhat’s a better alternative to using a gas stove as a heater? You should only use your gas stove as a heater in an absolute emergency.\nGas heaters are very unsafe. Even though I listed a few solutions for the most common safety issues in this post, your stove can still be dangerous.\nThe uncalculated dangers (that we both probably don’t even think about) are much greater in a gas stove than in a portable gas heater that has been around and tested for decades.\nThat’s why I always recommend using a portable propane heater as a backup heat source.\nPropane heaters can output the same amount of heat as your gas stove.\nBut they are a lot safer.\nMy personal favorite is the Mr. Heater Buddy (click here to view it on amazon). It has all the safety features you need. Including a built-in tip-over protection, an oxygen depletion sensor, and an auto-shutoff in case of overheating or an issue with the gas supply.\nUsing this gas hose (click here to view it on amazon), you can even connect it to your gas stove’s gas tank.\nSo, in an emergency, you can just hook up the propane heater and you are ready \u0026amp; safe to go.\nIf you are not in an emergency right now, but you are preparing, then the Mr. Heater Buddy is a must-get.\nConclusion You can use a gas stove for emergency heating if you are in an emergency right now. However, for emergency preparation, get a portable propane heater.\nA portable propane heater is very affordable ($100 to $200 depending on the model). And it ensures that you are safe and warm throughout any energy outage.\nImagine having an energy outage, and on top of that you blow your house up because you decided to use a gas stove as a heater.\nThat would be a stupid story to tell your grandchildren.\nSo, better prepare well!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-use-a-gas-stove-as-a-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you use a gas stove as a heater?

There are two kinds of propane heaters. Those that need electricity, and those that don’t.\nIn this article, you will learn which propane heaters you can use without electricity, completely off-grid!\nAnd you will learn about the types of propane heaters that use electricity and why.\nQuick answer: No, portable propane heaters never need electricity and work fully off-grid. However, central heating propane furnaces need electricity to run their built-in electronic thermostat, timers, and fans. Also, some RV propane heaters rely on the 12V car battery to run. Because only portable propane heaters work without electricity, you should always have one at home as an emergency heat source. Alternatively, you can power your propane furnace off a generator.\nWhich propane heaters work without electricity? Portable propane heaters always work without electricity. That’s their main selling point.\nTechnically, portable heaters rely on electricity to produce a spark that ignites the gas.\nBut you produce this spark independently of an electric grid using the built-in mechanical Piezo igniter. The igniter is a spring-loaded hammer that hammers on a crystal. The impact causes a high voltage, which, in turn, creates a spark.\nBut that’s not the kind of electricity you mean.\nPortable propane heaters always work fully off-grid. You don’t need access to electricity.\nThis means you can use portable propane heaters in off-grid cabins, RVs, tents, or in any other place without electricity.\nYou can also rely on portable propane heaters in an electricity outage. You only need to keep a gas tank (or small 1lb propane bottles) around.\nRecommended portable propane heater that works without electricity My favorite portable propane heater is the Mr. Heater Buddy (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis one is strong enough to keep a large living room warm in winter.\nIf you need more power than that, or if the space you want to heat is poorly insulated, then you should get the bigger Mr. Heater Big Buddy (click here to view it on amazon). The Big Buddy outputs up to double the amount of heat of the Buddy.\nPersonally, I got mine as a backup heater in case of an electricity outage. But you can, of course, use them anywhere off-grid as well.\nHeck, you can even use them as supply heating simultaneously with your central heating. Gas is a lot more affordable than electricity.\nAlso, the Mr. Heater Buddy models are absolutely indoor-safe.\nIf you want to know more before getting your Mr. Heater, check out my review.\nI’d say that every household should have at least one portable propane heater. Honestly, it does not have to be a Mr. Heater model. Other propane heaters might work just as well.\nIt’s just the model that I (and many others) have at home as well, so I tend to recommend it.\nPortable propane heaters always work without electricity. My favorite is the Mr. Heater Buddy!\nAnyways, let’s have a look at propane heaters that do need electricity.\nWhich propane heaters need electricity? Propane heaters are gas-fueled. So, why would a propane heater ever use electricity?\nIntuitively propane heaters that rely on electricity don’t make sense.\nIn the end, you use propane gas to be independent of electricity.\nBut that’s not the case. Here’s which propane heaters need electricity:\nRV heaters Some RV propane heaters don’t have a built-in mechanical igniter. Instead, they rely on the 12V car battery to provide electric power.\nSome other RV propane heaters need regular batteries (eg. LR20 models) for the ignition. And you have to replace the batteries every few months or years depending on the usage.\nBut of course, there are also RV heaters that work fully independently of any source of electricity.\nIf you are not sure, you can simply get a Mr. Heater Buddy propane heater (which I recommended earlier) for your RV. This one never needs electricity.\nPropane furnaces Modern propane furnaces rely on electricity. With propane furnaces, I mean the big propane heaters that you use as central heating.\nIf you’ve ever seen a central heating system, you can tell that the front panel is full of settings.\nYou can set different day and night temperatures. You can set timers when the central heating has to shut off. And you can turn on and off the heating.\nOf course, these features all need electricity to work.\nIn addition, gas furnaces oftentimes have a built-in electronic thermostat that controls the gas valve.\nBut why?\n50 to 100 years ago, gas furnaces were, of course, completely analog. They did not rely on electricity. In case you live in a very old building, it might be that your central heating does not work electrically.\nBut that’s unlikely since houses are continuously upgraded.\nElectronics in a propane furnace ensure that each furnace works just the same. It’s a lot simpler for furnace companies to produce an electronic valve control than to properly fine-adjust each device individually.\nIn addition to that, we modern humans want the luxury of automatic gas-usage reduction at night and an energy-efficient thermostat.\nThat’s the reason we ended up with propane furnaces that require electricity to run. I guess it’s understandable.\nDo propane furnaces work during an electricity outage? No, propane furnaces stop working during an electricity outage.\nEven though the heat source is gas, which would burn independently of electricity, propane furnaces shut off during an electricity outage.\nThe reason is that the embedded electronics, such as the thermostat which controls the gas valves don’t work without electricity.\nActually, that’s not only the case for gas furnaces. Many oil furnaces stop working without electricity.\nHow to prepare for an electricity outage? To prepare for an electricity outage, it is, therefore, important to either have a backup electricity source, or a backup heat source.\nLet’s have a look at both of them.\nPower your propane furnace off a generator Propane furnaces don’t need a lot of electricity. In an energy outage, you could power your propane furnace off a 1,000W generator.\nBuying a 1,000W generator, however, hardly makes sense. In the end, you want reliable heat and electricity during an energy outage.\nSo, I would recommend getting this Westinghouse 6,600W generator (click here to view it on amazon) for electricity outages.\nThe Westinghouse generator is able to power your propane furnace and many other heavy-duty devices simultaneously.\nJust make sure that you use long heavy-duty extension cords when you use large devices with this generator.\nI recommend this 100 feet Clear Power extension cord(click here to view it on amazon).\nThis one comes in very handy when your furnace is in the basement and you have to get the electricity upstairs somehow.\nIt can handle enough current to power your furnace, fridge, your TV, and chargers simultaneously.\nUse a portable propane heater Alternatively, you should always keep a propane tank (I recommend 100 lbs) and a portable propane heater at home.\nA 6,000 BTU propane heater (which is large enough to keep your living room warm) will last 12 days of continuous 24h heating during an outage.\nThat’s more than enough in most cases!\nPortable propane heaters are very affordable. They cost anywhere between $100 and $200. And they can save your and your family’s life when the energy goes out during the winter.\nThat’s why, in my opinion, every household should have a portable propane heater at home.\nNot only are they great for RV trips, garages, basements, or even in tents, but they are also a literal lifesaver in emergencies.\nModern propane heaters are fully indoor safe and they emit zero carbon monoxide.\nAgain, I recommend the Mr. Heater Buddy (click here to view it on amazon).\nConclusion Some propane heaters need electricity and won’t work without it. So, it is very important that you always have a backup heat source at home.\nYou either need a generator to run your propane furnace from, or you need a portable propane heater.\nPortable propane heaters are very affordable. And they are a maintenance-free one-off expense. You buy it once and you are covered for the next decades of outages.\nAlso, get a 20lb to 100lb propane tank depending on the length of the outages you suspect. With 20lb you can heat your living space for 2-3 days. With 100lb you can heat for 12 days continuously.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/do-propane-heaters-need-electricity/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDo propane heaters need electricity?

When I googled this phrase initially, I found answers diverging all over the place.\nPeople answered “yes” and “no” everywhere without actually proving their point somehow.\nI am going to place my three space heaters (oil-filled radiator, infrared heater, and propane heater) on top of a living room table and see if anything happens.\nAdditionally, I am going to prove that you can place your space heater on tables as well using simple physics.\nQuick answer: Yes, you can put a space heater on a table. Space heaters radiate heat away from the tabletop, so there is no risk of fire. Running infrared and propane heaters from a table can increase their perceived heating efficiency since you can point the heaters directly at you from an elevated surface. Placing an oil-filled radiator on a table makes no sense since radiates the heat in all directions anyways.\nLet’s have a deep dive.\nExperiment: Can you put a space heater on a table? I am using a regular living room sofa table for the experiment. It’s made of regular cheap compressed wood.\nI placed 3 space heaters on top and turned them all on and let them heat up.\nWhat happens?\nWell… nothing dangerous happens. And my house is not on fire yet. I did a few measurements using a laser thermometer. Let’s have a look at these.\nWhy you can place your space heater on a table There are three things we have to look at to tell whether space heaters are safe on tabletops.\nHow hot do tabletops get because of space heaters?\nSpace heaters get very hot. Oil-filled radiators have a surface temperature of 180°F. The heating elements of an infrared heater get over 750°F. And propane heaters get over 932°F.\nThat’s where my laser thermometer’s measurement range ends.\nThese are, however, the hottest temperatures present in the space heater.\nWhat really counts for table safety is the heat to which your table is exposed.\nFor each space heater, I took a temperature measurement of the tabletop right in front of it (for the infrared and propane heater) and the tabletop right below it (for the oil-filled radiator).\nHeater type****Tabletop temperatureOil-filled radiator67.6°FInfrared heater112.6°FPropane heater116.4°F\nAs you can see, the tabletop temperatures that these space heaters cause are absolutely safe.\nNone of the space heaters get anywhere close to dangerous temperatures.\nThese are not even enough to stain or age your tabletop finish (like the yellowing of paper with time or heat).\nI am positively surprised by the oil-filled radiator which does not heat up the tabletop at all. The reason is likely the design of oil-filled radiators. Oil-filled radiators work using convection, which is the movement of hot air.\nHot air always rises, so the heat is carried away from the oil-filled radiator. None of the heat sinks down to heat up the tabletop.\nMaybe the tabletop heats up through radiation if you wait longer. But I’d suspect the upper temperature limit for the tabletop below an oil-filled radiator to be around 120°F (same as infrared and propane heater).\nInfrared heaters barely heat up the tabletop as well. The reason is that they always radiate the heat slightly upwards and never into the floor. Of course, a part of the radiation reaches the floor (or tabletop in this case).\nBut that’s just a small fraction.\nPropane heaters emit a majority of their heat using convection as well. Yes, they glow like infrared heaters as well. But only very little heat comes out of the front if you compare it to the amount of heat coming out of the top vents.\nSo, propane heaters also distribute their heat mostly upwards.\nMeasuring the tabletop temperatures different space heaters produce\nWhich table materials can you put a space heater on? Let’s have a look at three common table materials and whether you can run your space heater on them.\nWood Most tables are made of wood. Wood randomly auto-ignites at above 1,100°F. That’s the temperature where wood starts burning without a coordinated ignition.\nFor example, when you kindle a fireplace, you use kindling material, topped with thin pieces of wood and then larger logs. In this case, wood starts burning at a much lower temperature!\nBut when running a space heater on a table, you don’t have a coordinated ignition setup.\nThat’s why you have to consider the random autoignition temperature above with wood ignites independently of how it is kindled.\nThe temperature to ignite a wood table is too high for a space heater to reach. Additionally, space heaters radiate the heat away from the table. So, a fire is unlikely.\nPlastic Some tables are, however, made of different materials such as plastic or glass.\nI would not run a space heater on a plastic table.\nMost plastic materials start melting at around 250°F. Even if the space heaters in the experiment above did not heat the table top to this temperature, it might well be that different heater models do.\nNever place a space heater on a plastic table. Plastic has a low melting temperature which some strong space heaters or space heaters with a bad heat distribution might reach.\nGlass Glass only melts at very high temperatures. And it never ignites. So, it is fire-safe.\nHowever, apart from heating, space heaters could potentially break glass tables due to their weight.\nAt least an oil-filled radiator can.\nOil-filled radiators weigh 18.9 pounds with the heaviest models around 27 pounds.\nThis might be too heavy for some glass tables.\nYou can place most infrared and propane heaters on your glass table since they are very lightweight.\nBut oil-filled radiators are heavy. So, avoid placing them on any surface that breaks easily.\nDoes putting a space heater on a table make sense? Putting a space heater on a table absolutely makes sense for heaters that radiate heat, eg. infrared and propane heaters.\nYou can use your table as a pedestal for infrared heaters.\nThe main advantage of infrared heaters is that they radiate the heat in one direction only. And the best placement for infrared direct-path heating is rarely from the floor.\nIf you, for example, sit on your living room couch, you can place your infrared heater on top of the sofa table so it directly heats you.\nIf you run your space heater from the floor only, it might only be able to heat your feet. And if you lie on your sofa, there might not even be a good direct heating path.\nSo, the closer you place your infrared heater to you, the more heat you feel.\nPutting a space heater on a table in order to increase your personal heat exposure increases the heat you feel and it lowers your electricity bill (since you can run your heater on lower settings).\nOn the other hand, putting an oil-filled radiator on a table makes no sense at all. First, oil-filled radiators radiate their heat in all directions evenly. So you might as well put them on the floor.\nAnd also, oil-filled radiators stand on rolls. So it’s very easy to accidentally push them off the table.\nTo summarize: Running infrared heaters (whether electric or propane) on a tabletop makes sense. But placing an oil-filled radiator on a tabletop is not a good idea.\nSafety tips for running a space heater on a table The worst thing that can happen when you run your space heater on a table is that it tips over and drops on the floor.\nLikely, this won’t start a fire. However, the impact can damage your floor.\nIn general, heaters don’t just tip over on their own. There always has to be someone bumping into the table or into the heater.\nTherefore, I recommend running your space heater only if you don’t have pets or small kids at home.\nOr at least, don’t leave a space heater unattended on a tabletop.\nConclusion It makes sense to put infrared and propane space heaters on a table to increase their perceived efficiency.\nPlacing them on the table improves the direct-path heat radiation that reaches you and therefore makes you feel warmer without using more power.\nSo, putting radiant heaters on a tabletop can improve your heating efficiency.\nHowever, putting convection heaters such as oil-filled radiators on tables does not make sense. These heaters usually distribute the heat evenly across the room. Placing an oil-filled radiator on a table does not make a difference.\nTo increase an oil-filled radiator’s efficiency, put your feet against it and lower the settings!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-put-a-space-heater-on-a-table/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you put a space heater on a table?

Why do we use infrared heaters and not visible light heaters?\nIn this article, you will find out why infrared radiation is so common in heating and what makes infrared the only reasonable heat source.\nQuick answer: Infrared radiation is not hotter than visible light. Most radiators (in a physical sense), however, emit the majority of their heat as infrared radiation. This makes infrared heat the most common form of heat in your everyday life. A single-wavelength visible light laser or LED shows that you do perceive visible light as heat as well.\nBut first, are we even asking the right question?\nIs infrared really hotter than visible light? When do humans perceive something as hot? You always have an intuitive understanding of temperature. Both heat and cold can damage your body.\nThat’s what evolution taught us.\nIn a physical sense, the temperature is just the energy with which atoms and molecules around us and in our body move.\nYou perceive something as hot when it gets the molecules in your body moving.\nSo, what wiggles around the molecules in your body?\nTwo things that get your molecules moving are friction and impact. But let’s focus on the third: radiation.\nRadiation absorption Radiation is a field (electric or magnetic) that changes its polarity with time. Changing magnetic or electric fields create electromagnetic waves, which are basically changing electric and magnetic fields orthogonal to each other.\nBecause some molecules in your body are either positively or negatively charged or have a polarity (meaning one side of the molecule has a different charge than the opposite side), radiation causes these molecules to wiggle around.\nOne example of a polar molecule is water. And water is abundant in your body. Since water molecules are affected strongly by electromagnetism, the water in your body absorbs a lot of radiation energy!\nThat’s the reason nuclear fuel elements are drowned in big water tanks. Yes, water absorbs that much radiation.\n( This does not explain, however, why your phone stops working underwater… )\nLong-wavelength radiation causes molecules to move around slowly, while short-wavelength radiation moves molecules quickly.\nInfrared radiation has a long wavelength.\nSo, intuitively, you could even assume that shorter wavelength (visible) light gets your body hotter.\nBut this isn’t the case. Here’s why:\nAbundance of infrared light on earth Let’s do a quick experiment. Grab a magnifying glass and focus sunlight on a piece of paper. If you do it correctly, the paper will change color, then smoke and then start burning.\nThis experiment proves that visible light heats!\nAlso, you can turn on a large lightbulb or a very bright LED. You will feel the heat from the light reaching you.\nDid you ever stand on a stage with all the lights beaming at you? Hot, right?\nSo, it seems that visible light is, in fact, hot.\nSo, why do we associate infrared radiation with heat and not visible light?\nThe reason is the way objects emit radiation. If you’ve ever seen the Planck heat distribution, you can tell that the hotter an object is, the more energy it emits in the ultraviolet (short-wavelength) region.\nWhen physicists talk about hot objects, they usually don’t refer to a regular household heating system. Instead, they mean stars and other extremely hot objects.\nHowever, all of the objects that we humans consider “hot” on earth are not hot at all in a physical sense.\nThey emit the majority of heat as infrared radiation.\nThe reason we associate infrared radiation with heat is that the temperature that causes objects to emit infrared-region heat is abundant on earth.\nOn the other hand, we don’t consider visible or UV light “hot” because there are no objects that hot on earth.\nMost humanly tolerable heat sources are infrared.\nMost radiation is in the infrared-range spectrum according to Planck\u0026rsquo;s law\nIs infrared hotter than visible light? Infrared radiation is not hotter than visible light. It is just much more abundant in our everyday lives.\nUsually, when something is hot, it is glowing red (such as hot metal right before melting) or of no color (a wood stove’s surface getting hot).\nGlowing red indicates that an object is hot enough to emit visible light. A hot object that does not glow emits infrared radiation only. It is not hot enough to emit visible light.\nBut it can still be hot enough to burn your fingers on.\nCan you heat using visible light? Technically, you can heat using visible light just as well as you can heat using any regular infrared-based heater.\nThe only reason all heaters are infrared is that infrared radiation is the wavelength that hot objects naturally emit.\nIf you have a strong single-wavelength radiator, such as a laser or a strong LED, you can theoretically build your own non-infrared heater.\nLasers of visible wavelengths are used to cut metal. So they might as well heat your room.\nSimilarly, a strong LED emits heat, no matter the wavelength.\nPersonally, I’d say that visible light heaters would, however, be a bit annoying, or even dangerous.\nFirst, they always make your entire room bright (if you have a uniformly radiating light source), or they cut through the wall (if you use a focused laser).\nNot very practical.\nI like that my room’s radiator does not glow blue, green, or red.\nWhy infrared heaters are superior to visible light heat There’s another thing that makes infrared heaters superior to the theoretical visible light heater.\nInfrared radiation does not scatter as much as visible or UV light does.\nIf you don’t know what scattering is, think of it as a kind of uncontrolled reflection in a random direction.\nWith infrared radiation, you can direct the heat right at you and most of the heat reaches you.\nYou can do the same thing with visible light. However, usually, heaters have a safety grid mounted to their front.\nThe safety grid would scatter a part of the visible light, which causes the heat energy to radiate somewhere else.\nThis is a tiny effect. However, it is another reason for infrared to be better than shorter-wavelength radiation for heating.\nInfrared heaters create very hot temperatures. But theoretically, you can build a blue or green wavelength heater with about the same characteristics.\nConclusion This article is a Monday-afternoon meditation for me. Usually, I write about actual infrared heaters and how to efficiently use them at home.\nThis time, I deep-dived into physics.\nInfrared heat is no different than visible-light heat!\nThis is a surprising finding for me. And I hope you find this insightful as well.\nAs an electrical engineer, I tend to simplify concepts for better understanding. Since I am not a radiation physicist, shoot me a mail if you disagree with my findings!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/why-is-infrared-hotter-than-visible-light/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhy is infrared radiation hotter than visible light?

In this article, we’re going to check the average infrared heater’s running cost, by running time, location, electricity rate, and usage.\nAfter checking the cost, we will have a look at how to reduce the cost to run your infrared heater.\nWe will also check whether a thermostat will really help reduce infrared heater running cost and I will recommend you the infrared heater I think is best!\nQuick answer: An infrared heater costs $57.60 a month given it runs on full power for 8 hours a day. However, in reality, infrared heaters shut off occasionally (to prevent overheating) and their directional heat output allows you to reduce the heat settings while feeling the same heat. Factoring in these infrared-specific advantages results in a 20-40% decrease in electricity cost.\nThe running cost of an infrared heater depends only on two factors. They are power consumption and electricity rate.\nTheoretically, all you have to do to get your infrared heater’s running cost is to multiply your home’s running cost by your infrared heater’s power consumption.\nLuckily, I did all the maths for you!\nBut let’s first check the power infrared heaters use!\nHow much power do infrared heaters use? In the US, the average infrared heater consumes 1,500W of power. In Europe and in the UK you can find infrared heaters with \u0026gt;2,000W.\nThe reason for the US-average power rating being lower is that US households run on 120V of power (instead of 230V).\nAdditionally, a lot of home circuits can handle no more than 15A. Above that, circuit breakers trip.\n120V × 15A = 1,800W\nSo, the upper limit for electric devices in the US is 1,800W. And that’s why space heaters tend to be 1,500W.\nThey could theoretically be 1,800W, but then you’d be operating them at the edge of possibility. And you could not run a single additional device simultaneously. You could not even charge your phone, since this would overload the circuit.\nIn Europe and the UK, electronic devices can consume up to\n230V × 15A = 3450W\nwhich sets the limit for heating capabilities a lot higher!\nThere are also smaller infrared heaters available. Some models use only 800W or 1,000W.\nWhat’s your electricity rate? The other factor determining how much your infrared heater costs to run is your electricity rate.\nYour location usually determines your electricity rate. In some US states, the electricity rate is much lower than in others. And, of course, the electricity rate varies by country as well.\nHere’s a list of average electricity rates in the US:\nAverage electricity rates\nHere’s a list of all US states and their current average electricity rate. The data is from the US Energy Information Administration.\nStateElectricity rate (in Cents per kWh)Alabama15.19Alaska23.59Arizona13.1Arkansas12.58California25.49Colorado14.97Connecticut25.04Delaware16.16District of Columbia15.47Florida14.21Georgia14.31Hawaii44.85Idaho11.24Illinois17.25Indiana17.15Iowa13.36Kansas15.1Kentucky13.99Louisiana14.06Maine23.06Maryland15.86Massachusetts26.28Michigan18.18Minnesota14.95Mississippi13.44Missouri12.21Montana12.46Nebraska12.03Nevada15.23New Hampshire30.44New Jersey16.42New Mexico14.68New York23.29North Carolina13.51North Dakota11.73Ohio15.25Oklahoma14.42Oregon11.91Pennsylvania17.63Rhode Island24.64South Carolina14.68South Dakota13.25Tennessee13.07Texas14.77Utah10.99Vermont21.14Virginia14.61Washington10.59West Virginia14.4Wisconsin16.19Wyoming12.01U.S. Average16.09\nThe average electricity rate in the EU is 25 Euro-Cents per kWh.\nIn the UK, the current average electricity rate is 52p per kWh.\nIn Canada, the average rate is 0.16 CAD per kWh, which is $0.12.\nAs you see, electricity prices vary heavily by location.\nUnfortunately, there’s nothing you can do about it unless you move. But moving just for the sake of a cheaper electricity rate is rarely an option.\nIn some states (and countries) the energy market is deregulated. Effectively, this means that you can switch energy providers, which offer different electricity rates.\nHowever, the savings are usually marginal.\nHow much do infrared heaters cost to run? Now that we know how much power infrared heaters consume and we know your electricity rate, let’s have a look at how much an infrared heater would cost you.\nInfrared heater running cost by running duration In this table, I calculated the running cost of an average 1,500W infrared heater using the US average electricity rate of 16 cents per kWh.\nRunning duration****Infrared heater running cost1 hour$0.244 hours$0.968 hours$1.9224 hours$5.761 week (8 hours a day)$13.441 week (24 hours a day)$40.321 month (8 hours a day)$57.601 month (24 hours a day)$172.80\nInfrared heater running cost by location **Location****Electricity rate (in $/kWh)****Hourly running cost (in $)****Monthly running cost (8h per day)**US$0.16$0.24$57.60Canada$0.12$0.18$43.20Europe$0.27$0.41$97.20UK$0.63$0.95$226.80\nFor comparability, I converted all the electricity rates to US-Dollar.\nElectricity rates in the US and Canada are very different than in Europe and the UK.\nWhy these calculations are off The tables above show the average running cost of a 1,500W infrared heater running at full power for a specific time.\nMost infrared heaters, however, don’t run at 1,500W continuously. That’s just the maximum power usage. Usually, infrared heaters cut off the heating to prevent overheating either due to a built-in thermostat or overheat protection.\nIn this case, you would have to factor into the cost calculation that your infrared heater runs only part-time. This would decrease the average power consumption from 1,500W to, say, 1,000W.\nUnfortunately, that’s not the case for all heaters. Some models, especially old ones, don’t have a built-in temperature control mechanism.\nAnd even for the infrared heaters that shut off occasionally, you can’t really unify the power usage numbers since most heaters use different heat control algorithms.\nContinuous power usage of 1,500W is the high end of the spectrum.\nI prefer to estimate a bit too-high cost than to estimate too low and get you a bad surprise when you get your electricity bill.\nSo, the values from the table above show the maximum cost to run an infrared heater.\nHow to account for a built-in thermostat If your infrared heater has a built-in thermostat, you can estimate the power usage in the following way:\nTurn on your infrared heater at full power With a stopwatch, measure the time Wait until a heating element turns off (which would indicate an active temperature control) and note the time Note the time when the heating turns on again (you can usually hear a “clicking” sound) Stop the experiment after 5 minutes if your infrared heater doesn’t shut off Now you know the fraction of running time where your infrared heater does not heat.\nYou can reduce your electricity cost by this fraction.\nFor example, if your infrared heater heats for 3 minutes and then turns on after the 4th minute, this means it is running only 75% of the time.\nSo, the average power usage of your infrared heater is\n1,500W × 0.75 = 1,125W\nAccordingly, assuming your monthly infrared heater running cost according to the table above is $57.60, you can expect a 25% cost reduction:\n$57.60 × 0.75 = $43.20\nWhy infrared heaters cost less to run than other electric heaters And that’s not even the end of the cost calculation! You can also factor in a very characteristic feature of infrared heaters!\nInfrared heaters don’t distribute the heat evenly in all directions. Instead, they radiate the heat in just one direction.\nInfrared heaters focus their heat. They have a directional heat distribution.\nThis means if you run an infrared heater in your room and you point it toward you, you will feel warmer than if you run an equivalent electric space heater that’s non-infrared.\nEven if both heaters use 1,500W of power, the infrared heater will feel as if it is more powerful, because it focuses the heat radiation on you.\nSo, proper infrared heater placement largely affects your heater’s perceived efficiency!\nBut what does this have to do with the cost to run your infrared heater?\nWell, if an infrared heater makes you feel warmer than another heater, then the following statement also has to be true:\nYou can reduce the heat setting of your infrared heater and it will feel the same as the heat coming from a comparable non-infrared 1,500W heater.\nSo, effectively, you can run your infrared heater at lower settings. You don’t need to run it at maximum capacity.\nI run my infrared heater on the lowest setting while it\u0026rsquo;s standing on my desk and feel perfectly warm\nSome people claim that infrared heaters are up to 40% more efficient than other heaters. However, this is both technically incorrect and, I think, exaggerated.\nWhat matters is how you use your infrared heater. If you run it at full power, you can expect the full bill.\nIf you run it at half power (because half power feels warm enough for you), you can cut your electricity bill calculation in half.\nSo, running an infrared heater at half power for 8 hours a day in the US would cost you $28.80 a month.\nWhich infrared heater is the cheapest to run? My all-time favorite infrared heater is this Dr. Infrared Heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nI particularly like that it’s made of solid wood, which has better longevity and a higher ignition temperature than most plastic materials.\nThis makes the Dr. Infrared heater extra safe.\nOf course, it also comes with a built-in thermostat, where you can set your desired temperature and everything else you need in a heater.\nI have to note one thing, which we can base on the findings of this article:\nThe Dr. Infrared heater is not necessarily cheaper to run than other infrared heaters. Yes, it has a built-in thermostat. And it radiates the heat in only one direction, which increases the perceived efficiency.\nHowever, other infrared heater models do provide the same features. I only recommend the Dr. Infrared Heater because it’s such a trusted model.\nBut technically, all infrared heaters can heat your room just as well as long as they run on 1,500W.\nHow to reduce an infrared heater’s running cost Now that you know the largest factors of your infrared heater’s electricity cost (electricity rate, power consumption, usage), here are some things you can do to make your infrared heater more efficient:\nPlacement The most important efficiency advantage of infrared heaters over other types of heaters is their directional heat distribution. Make use of it!\nAlways place your infrared heater in a way that it faces you. The closer it is to you, the more heat you perceive. This, in turn, means that you can reduce the power settings.\nUsually, placing an infrared heater right in front of the area where people are is the most efficient way to heat. Your infrared heater then only covers a part of the room. But this heated part of the room feels very cozy!\nInsulation You can also decrease your infrared heater’s running cost by reducing the amount of heat that leaves your room.\nA simple door air draft stopper (click to view it on amazon) can have a significant impact on your energy bills! It’s a small one-off cost, which reduces your energy bills for years to come!\nThese one-time improvements that yield positive results forever are absolutely worth it! You can stick to this principle outside of heating as well!\nConclusion Running an average 1,500W infrared heater for 8 hours a day in the US costs $57.60 in a month.\nThis calculation is based on the average electricity rate of 16 cents per kWh and an average power consumption of 1,500W.\nNaturally, infrared heaters are more efficient than other types of heaters, which means you likely won’t need to run them at full power all the time!\nYou can reduce the power setting of your infrared heater, place it closer to you and perceive the same amount of heat.\nYou should factor this efficiency improvement through placement into the calculation.\nEffectively, I would estimate a realistic electricity bill to be around $40 a month in the US.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-much-do-infrared-heaters-cost-to-run/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow much does an infrared heater cost to run?

In this article, we’re going to check the most common reasons and ways to fix them.\nAfter reading this article, you will know exactly how to get your wood stove as hot as you need it to be!\nYou will know exactly what to do and why.\nQuick answer: A wood stove usually does not get hot because of an insufficient oxygen supply. You can fix this by opening the air intake valves and cleaning the burning chamber, the vents, and the wood grate. Also, make sure that you use seasoned firewood. Also, verify that your chimney’s diameter fits your wood stove size. You can maximize chimney airflow with a chimney liner.\nLet’s have a look at all of the different reasons and ways to fix each of them!\nReasons and fixes for a wood stove not getting hot Almost all heating issues with wood stoves are in some way related to insufficient oxygen supply.\nThe wood in your wood stove needs oxygen to burn efficiently. Without or with a lack of oxygen, the wood burn is very inefficient, meaning you get very little heat out of it.\nAlso, a lack of oxygen always causes the production of carbon monoxide and other toxic gases.\nSo, getting the right amount of oxygen into your wood stove is crucial!\nThere’s no single way to test a lack of oxygen in your wood stove. Since there are multiple possible issues that cause a lack of oxygen, you have to test multiple things:\n1. Air intake valves closed Wood stoves usually have between one and three air vents. Each of those vents is responsible for opening and closing airflow into your wood stove.\nUsually, one vent opens the airflow into the bottom part of your wood stove. Sometimes, when you have a second or even a third vent, then these are responsible to supply the sides or the top part of your wood stove with oxygen.\nHow to test: You can adjust the air intake with a small lever or knob (that you pull or push), one for each air valve.\nOpen all of your air vents. If your air vents were closed before, and you didn’t even know that they existed, then here’s your fix!\nHow to fix: Before lighting a fire, always open up all of the air intakes. When your fire burns brightly, you can lower the air intake to force a slower burn.\nThe wood stove in our home has two air intake valves\n2. Airtight room Wood stoves exhaust waste gases out of the chimney. This creates a suction that is used to pull new and fresh air into the wood stove.\nNow, imagine your room is fully sealed and no air can enter it. Then, your wood stove would not be able to suck in any air.\nTo be physically correct: Your wood stove would be able to suck in a bit of air from your room. But, since this air is now missing in your room, the suction creates a negative pressure in your room.\nThe negative pressure would build up until the suction from your wood stove can’t overpower it anymore.\nThen, the fire would extinguish.\nReal-life rooms are never perfectly sealed. Every burning wood stove is proof of a room not being perfectly sealed.\nThere are always gaps and cracks below doors and millimeter openings in windows that allow air to enter your room.\nIf your room is airtight, then you won’t be able to heat it.\nHow to test: Light your wood stove. See how it burns. Then, open your window and see if the burn improves. If it improves, then your room is too airtight for your wood stove.\nHow to fix: Usually rooms are not airtight unless someone (you?) tries hard to insulate it.\nThe first thing to look at is the gap below your room’s door. Is it wide enough for air to pass it?\nEven a millimeter should be enough. But if you use a door draft stopper, that’s what might be the reason. Rubber draft stoppers are worse than fabric or sponge draft stoppers, which allow a bit of airflow.\nRemove all this additional air insulation from your room and see if your wood stove burns properly now.\n3. Clogged air vents The third reason for a lack of oxygen in a wood stove is the lack of airflow below your wood.\nMerely opening the air intake valves does not guarantee proper airflow into your wood stove.\nYour air vents could be clogged with ash.\nAlso, make sure your wood stove pipe is not clogged! For this, you can use a large wood stove pipe wire brush!\nHow to test: Check the air vents of your wood stove. Do they allow airflow? You can test this using a wire brush. Push it through the air vent and see whether ash comes out of the other end of the vent.\nHow to fix: Clean all of the air vents with a wire brush. Use a large wire brush for the stove pipe.\nThis thing is a large wire brush with which you can clean wood stove pipes\n4. No wood grate Also, make sure that your wood grate is clean. The wood grate is the metal grid on which you place the wood.\nAnd, of course, don’t forget to use a wood grate in the first place! Pre-built wood stoves usually have a wood grate. But if you built your own stove, then you have to get a wood grate that fits it!\nHow to test: Have a look at the inside of your wood stove. Is there a grate on which you put your wood? If yes, is it clean and does it allow airflow below the wood?\nHow to fix: Clean your clogged grate. If you don’t have a grate yet, then build this US stove grate (click here to view it on amazon) into your stove. For larger barrel stoves, use this barrel stove wood grate (click here to view it on amazon).\n5. Heat escapes through pipe Fire burns with temperatures up to 2,000°F (1,100°C). Also, heat is energy. And energy does not vanish.\nIf there’s a fire burning in your stove and it’s not getting hot, this means that the heat leaves somewhere.\nThe most likely heat sink in your wood stove is the pipe. And you can’t really do much about the pipe.\nYou need it because the pipe is an exhaust path for the smoke. And the pipe supports the air circulation inside your wood stove.\nSo, we don’t really want to change anything about your wood stove pipe. But why does the heat leave through the pipe then?\nThe air passing through the pipe has to be hot. The reason is that hot air rises faster through the chimney, which helps suck more air into the stove.\nSo, it’s expected that heat escapes through the pipe.\nHow to test: You can verify that heat escapes through your wood stove pipe by touching the pipe. Be quick and careful! Wood stove pipes can easily get as hot as a frying pan.\nHow to fix: You can’t really fix the heat escaping through your wood stove pipe. Some heat always has to leave to draw fresh oxygen-rich air into the stove, which, in turn, enhances the burn.\nHowever, if you think that your wood stove pipe gets way too hot, then you can absorb a part of the heat by wrapping a copper (or any other metal) duct or wire around the pipe. The metal will then absorb the heat from the pipe and radiate it into the room.\nI think, however, that this is a waste of money, since the heat absorption improvement is only marginal. Additionally, it makes your wood stove look ugly.\nAnd, worst of all, because the DIY heat reclaimer absorbs heat from the exhaust air inside the pipe, the exhaust air rises slower, which reduces the amount of air that is sucked into your stove.\nSo, trying to fix a too-hot wood stove pipe is a zero-sum game and not worth it.\n6. Chimney diameter is too large or too small All of the exhaust air leaving your wood stove goes through the chimney. The design of the chimney is crucial for a proper wood stove burn.\nFor example, wide chimneys are good for large wood stoves and fireplaces. Narrow chimneys are good for small wood stoves since they increase the rising velocity.\nSimilarly, long chimneys cause a higher hot air rising velocity than short chimneys.\nIt could be that your wood stove does not get hot because the chimney does not fit the wood stove’s size.\nHow to test: Theoretically, the best test for this would be to test your wood stove with a different chimney. And to test your chimney with different wood stoves. However, that’s not practical.\nYou can’t really know exactly which chimney and wood stove combination fits unless you consult a technician. Where I live it’s mandatory to get a professional’s approval before installing a wood stove.\nBut that’s not the case everywhere. So, if you did not get formal approval for your wood stove, I’d recommend checking your heater’s heating capacity and your chimney length and diameter.\nThen find out online, or by consulting a professional, whether your setup works or not.\nHow to fix: If your wood stove and chimney combination does not work, you can usually fix it using a chimney liner.\nA chimney liner is an insert for your chimney to narrow your chimney’s diameter. A proper chimney liner maximizes your wood stove’s burning efficiency and helps with proper airflow.\nHowever, they are usually very expensive (well above \u0026gt;$1,000), and you usually need to hire someone to do it for you.\nIf that’s not an option for you, continue with the next tips!\n7. Wood stove has a large heat capacity Some materials take longer to heat up than others. Also, two objects of the same material, but of different masses will have different heat-up times.\nSome wood stoves are made of different materials than others. And some wood stoves are heavier than others.\nThat’s why it’s perfectly normal for some wood stoves to take very long to heat up.\nThe wood stove in my home heats a lot faster than that of my grandparents.\nA lightweight (if we can ever use that word in combination with wood stoves) metal wood stove heats up quickly. Its walls are solid, but relatively thin metal. Metal is a great heat conductor. You can feel a metal wood stove heating up within 10 minutes.\nOn the other hand, a large wood stove, built of metal and heat-absorbing stones will take longer to heat up. After starting the fire, the heat first has to heat up the stone slabs before it reaches you.\nHow to test: Your wood stove usually has a small heat capacity, and, therefore, heats up quickly, if it is plain metal.\nHowever, if your wood stove has natural stone plates attached to it, which absorb the heat, then it will take a while to heat up.\nHow to fix: There’s nothing you can and should do about it. To change your wood stove’s heat capacity, you would have to add or remove parts of it, which makes no sense.\nJust be more patient!\nThese natural stones absorb a lot of heat. It takes some time for your wood stove to get them hot\n8. Stove too large for room Stoves (and all kinds of heaters in general) have to fit your room size. You can’t heat a large room with a small stove. And accordingly, using a large stove in a small room rarely makes sense.\nThe main issue with large stoves is their heat capacity which causes a long heat-up time (as we’ve seen in the previous section).\nHow to test: You can check your stove’s manual and data sheet to see the room size it is designed for.\nHow to fix: Use a smaller stove in your small room.\n9. Wet wood Fresh wood outputs a lot less heat than dried and aged wood. The reason is the water content in fresh wood.\nFor a proper burn, you don’t want water to absorb the heat energy continuously. A fresh piece of wood has a moisture content of 70%.\nThis means for each pound of dry wood, there are 0.7 lbs of water.\nA wood stove fire, therefore, has to provide enough heat to keep the fire going brightly and evaporate 0.7lb of water!\nAdditionally, the gaseous water rises out of the chimney.\nThat’s a lot of energy being wasted here!\nSo, always use as dry as possible wood! There’s a reason that burning coal (which is practically the same as wood with 0% moisture content) can melt metal, and fresh wood can’t.\nHow to test: Instead of using the potentially wet wood you have at home, buy dried wood at a store once. I know, it’s overpriced, but you have to do it for the sake of the experiment.\nIgnite the store-bought wood and see if there’s a difference. If the fire burns properly now, you got the reason!\nHow to fix: Pile your wood in a dry place. Ideally, don’t cover it under a plastic cover (which would increase humidity), but keep it under a roof. If you don’t have a dry place for your wood, then build one. It’s well worth it!\nDry your wood for 1-3 years (depending on the climate you live in).\nIf you don’t have a supply of dry wood right now, buy dried wood for the first few seasons and let your own wood dry in the meantime.\n“There is no danger in over-seasoning wood – drier is better.”\nForest Products Center tennessee.edu\nAlso, you can check your wood’s moisture content using this moisture meter(click here to view it on amazon). Your wood is ready when its moisture content is below 20%.\n10. Outside air too warm A wood stove can only burn properly if an air draft constantly fuels the combustion. For a proper air draft, one of the factors is the outside temperature.\nAs you probably know, hot air rises above cold air. That’s why your wood stove’s exhaust gases go out of the chimney in the first place.\nBut there’s another detail: The greater the temperature difference between the wood stove waste gases and the outside, the faster the hot gases rise.\nThis means your wood stove will have a stronger suction on very cold days than on warm days.\nSo, if the outdoor temperature is mild, this might be one reason for your wood stove not getting hot.\nIt’s very likely that it is not the sole reason. The hot waste gases going up the chimney are always significantly hotter than the outdoor air. They are usually between 300°F and 480°F. So, a change in outdoor temperature of +20°F would not affect the draft much.\nA 20°F outdoor temperature increase would decrease the draft between 4.1% and 6.7%.\nSo, while it is never the sole reason, the outside air being too warm can be a factor.\nHow to test: Check the temperature outside. Is it significantly warmer than on other days?\nHow to fix: To compensate for the draft decrease you have to open the air intakes up more. If they are already fully open, you can also increase the air intake by opening the wood stove door a bit.\n11. Wood stove fan or blower Stop using wood stove fans or wood stove blowers! Wood stove fans and blowers are small devices that blow the hot air from the wood stove into the room.\nA wood stove fan absorbs the heat from the stovetop or the stove pipe. Then it converts it to rising air and uses the kinetic (movement) energy from the rising air to rotate a fan. The fan then blows the warm air into your room.\nA blower usually does the same thing, but it is battery-powered.\nWhile the idea of a wood stove fan sounds good at first, it turns out to be a complete hoax. And they can even harm your wood stove.\nWood stove fans absorb the heat from your stove. This means that your stove (and the hot gases in it) miss this heat energy.\nIn turn, the hot waste gases going up the chimney have a smaller temperature. And “cold” waste gases don’t move up the chimney with force.\nThis means they don’t create enough pull to draw more air into the wood stove. This, in turn, hinders the fire inside the wood stove to burn properly.\nHow to test: Check if a wood stove fan stands on your wood stove. Also, check the wood stove pipe for a fan. It does not even necessarily need to be a fan. Anything that absorbs heat from your wood stove is bad.\nIt could be a coil wrapped around your wood stove pipe. Or it could be a metal structure that absorbs heat in any other way.\nHow to fix: Remove any object that prematurely absorbs heat from your wood stove.\n12. Dirty inside Even if your wood stove’s air intake is good, the dirt and ash in your wood stove’s burning chamber could prevent it from getting hot.\nAsh and creosote insulate the inside of your wood stove. They don’t prevent the fire from burning.\nEven worse: Ash and creosote sticking to the walls of your wood stove can increase the amount of heat trapped inside your wood stove.\nThis can increase the heat inside the wood stove. But, accordingly, it reduces the heat outside the wood stove.\nWhile it is very unlikely that the ash and creosote in your wood stove insulate the heat completely, it is another factor that can reduce the heat your wood stove gives off.\nHow to test: When your wood stove is cold, draw your finger along the inside wall. Is there a layer of ash and dirt? If yes, how thick is it?\nHow to fix: In any case, clean the inside walls of your wood stove. Also, to prevent dirt buildup in the future, I recommend cleaning the inside walls of your wood stove once every two weeks during the heating season.\nMake sure that the inner walls of your wood stove are always clean!\nWhat to do if your wood stove is still not getting hot? If, after checking all of the potential causes of your wood stove not getting hot, your wood stove is still not heating properly, I’d assume that something is critically wrong either with the wood stove or the chimney.\nSo, I recommend checking the chimney. Verify that your chimney is free of any obstructions. Did a cat fall into it? Or is it clogged with fallen leaves from autumn?\nA seriously clogged chimney is unlikely, but if your wood stove still does not get hot, then that’s something you should double-check.\nIf your chimney is OK, and you still have no idea why your wood stove is not working, I would recommend consulting a chimney sweeper.\nAlternatively, if you suspect your wood stove is trash (because you bought it who knows where), then throw it away and buy a new one from a stove company nearby. Let them install it. If it doesn’t heat properly, they will figure it out!\nConclusion Almost all wood stove problems are caused by a lack of airflow into the stove.\nThere are many things that cause a lack of airflow. It could be a bad design of the wood stove, a too-wide chimney, and an overly dirty burning chamber.\nAlso, it could be bad wood. Only use well-seasoned dry wood!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/wood-stove-not-getting-hot/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour wood stove is not getting hot?

In this article, we’re going to check all of the common propane heater noises!\nAfter reading this article, you’ll know exactly where your heater’s noise comes from and whether you can do anything about it.\nFor each noise listed, you’ll find a way to test for and fix the respective noise.\nQuick answer: Some propane heater noises such as clicking and crackling are normal. They come from the thermostat switching the heating settings, and from the parts heating up. Other sounds such as knocking, gurgling, and hissing are signs of propane leaks, air in the heater’s gas line, and the propane flame not burning properly. These need to be fixed.\nLet’s have a look!\nSummary of propane heater noises Before we dive into all of the fixes, here’s a quick look-up table with the noises we cover in this article.\n**Propane heater noiseReasonIs it dangerous?**ClickingThermostat or protection mechanism switches heat settingnoCracklingHeater parts heat up and expandnoKnockingIncomplete propane burnyesGurglingPropane tank is overfilled and gas has no room to boilnoHummingAir trapped in gas linenoHissingPropane gas leakingyes\nHow to fix your propane heater making noise Here’s the list of propane heater noises and their fixes!\n1. Clicking Some propane heaters occasionally click. The reason for a clicking noise in a propane heater is usually a built-in function to shut off the heating.\nThis could be a thermostat, an automatic shut-off timer, or an overheat protection.\nMost thermostats regulate the heating smoothly, meaning they slowly adjust the heat output based on the room’s temperature. But some simpler thermostats use a two-point control algorithm.\nThis is a temperature control algorithm that knows only two settings (the two points): Heater on and heater off.\nA propane heater often produces this clicking sound when the heater switches the heat setting from on to off or vice versa. This could be caused by a built-in relay or a clicking of the closing or opening gas valve.\nHow to test: You can easily test whether this is the cause of your propane heater’s noise by running your heater on full power and observing it. When there’s a clicking sound, does the heat output of your propane heater change?\nFor example, a heating panel could shut off or turn on.\nIf yes, then the clicking is due to a built-in temperature control mechanism, such as a thermostat or an overheat protection.\nThere’s nothing to worry about and your heater is working as expected.\nHow to fix: There’s no reasonable way to fix the clicking sound caused by a thermostat or overheat protection of a propane heater.\nHowever, there’s also no need to fix the clicking sound. Occasional clicking is expected and your heater is working just fine.\n2. Clicking when you carry the heater Portable propane heaters oftentimes have a built-in tip-over protection. The built-in tip-over protection automatically shuts off the heater when it is tilted beyond a certain angle.\nUsually, a tip-over protection is a simple metal weight that tips in either direction and touches a metal contact when you tip over your heater.\nTip-over protection could also be a long button on the bottom of your heater. As long as it’s standing on the floor, the tip-over protection button is pressed. But when you tip over your heater, the button is released and signals the heater to stop heating.\nIf your heater’s tip-over protection is a metal weight then it makes a clicking sound when it hits the metal contacts.\nHow to test: Lift your portable propane heater and tilt it in different directions. If it has weight-based tip-over protection, then it makes a clicking sound.\nThis oftentimes causes people to worry about their heater having loose internal parts. But that’s not the case.\nHow to fix: There’s no way to fix the clicking of tip-over protection. The protection mechanism makes a clicking sound and this is expected.\nPropane heater with tip-over protection activated\n3. Crackling Propane heaters reach very high temperatures. That’s why, after you light a cold propane heater, the parts heat up and make crackling sounds.\nThe reason is that the heat causes the individual parts of your propane heater to expand. The expansion causes pressure and friction to build up between parts. Some parts slip by their neighboring parts for a fraction of a millimeter.\nEven if you can’t see these micro-movements, they do make noise, which you perceive as crackling.\nIt’s similar to the crackling in a fire. Even though the individual wood logs don’t move, they crackle as the fire burns. ( This comparison is not ideal, since fires also involve mini gas explosions, but I hope you get the point anyways )\nMaybe a better comparison would be a cold wood stove crackling when you light a fire inside.\nHow to test: Light your propane heater. It should crackle after a few minutes. This is a sign that its components heat up.\nHow to fix: Also here there is no fix to be done. The crackling is expected and does not indicate a malfunctioning of your heater.\n4. Knocking Knocking sounds are the first real issues in a propane heater. Your propane heater makes a knocking sound when the flame does not burn properly.\nThis could potentially cause your propane heater to emit carbon monoxide.\nIt could even be that the flame disappears and lights again after a fraction of a second. This reignition or half-burning of gas can cause a knocking sound.\nIt’s as if your propane heater’s flames gasp for air.\nThe reason for the knocking sounds is likely an out-of-balance propane-to-air ratio.\nHow to test: Ignite your propane heater. Check the pilot light’s flame. Is it blue or yellow? If the flame is yellow, even if it’s only partly, then that’s a sign of an improperly adjusted propane heater.\nHow to fix: You can look up online (or in your propane heater’s manual) how you can adjust the oxygen intake of your propane heater.\nThen, adjust the oxygen intake until the gas flame is blue.\nIf you don’t want to do that yourself, you can also hire a technician to do it for you.\n5. Gurgling Gurgling sounds usually come from the propane gas and its state transition from liquid to gaseous.\nWhen the liquid propane gas leaves your propane tank, it decompresses and becomes a gas.\nWhen you open your propane tank gas valve, the pressure inside the tank reduces and propane gas leaves. The pressure reduction causes liquid propane to boil inside the propane tank.\nPropane tanks should always be filled to no more than 80% of their volume. That’s to leave space for the boiling to take place.\nIf your propane tank is overfilled, then this could cause very high pressure inside your propane tank. And after opening your propane tank, the liquid propane and propane gas mix start boiling right in front of or even inside your gas hose.\nThis causes the gurgling sound.\nHow to test: Open the gas valve of your propane tank and see if it makes a boiling sound. You can even try to open it outdoors without the heater connected to exclude the gurgling sound coming directly from your propane heater. Just be aware that this will waste a bit of your propane.\nHow to fix: Ideally, you should reduce the fill level of your propane tank. To do this, you could either fill another propane tank from your main tank. Or you could just blow out your propane (which would, however, be very wasteful).\nMy suggestion would be to keep using your current propane tank with your propane heater. Even if it makes a gurgling sound.\nIf the fill level of your propane tank is the issue, then the gurgling should stop after a few days of using your heater (once you reach fill levels below 80%).\nRunning a propane heater on a gurgling propane tank is not dangerous.\nSo, this issue usually resolves itself.\n6. Humming Humming noise in a propane heater or a propane tank is a sign of vibration. A common cause for vibration in a propane heater is air trapped in the gas hose or the gas regulator.\nThe air bubbles trapped in your heater or tank start vibrating because of the gas flow which excites the vibration.\nHow to test: Turn on your propane tank. Does it make a humming noise?\nHow to fix: To fix the humming noise, you have to bleed the propane line of air.\nThe simplest way to purge all the air is to hold down your pilot light button for 1 to 3 minutes. A bit of gas will leave through the pilot light’s opening. But this should refill your gas line with propane gas and thus reduce the humming noise.\nHow to prevent it: To prevent this issue from happening in the future, you should make sure that the gas hose, the gas tank, and your propane heater are connected tightly.\nThere should be no way for air to enter the system. If you’re not sure about your connection strength, you can tighten the connection with a wrench.\nThen you can check the seal of the connection by putting a water and soap mixture (or your spit) on the connection. If gas leaks, bubbles will appear.\n7. Hissing A hissing sound is always a sign of a gas leak! Gas leaks are very dangerous since they can fill your living space with ready-to-explode gas.\nNormally, gases are scented, so you should notice leaks by smell as well. If you don’t smell anything, the leak in your propane heater is likely very small.\nHow to test: Turn off your propane heater. Disconnect the gas tank from the heater. Do you still hear a hissing sound?\nIf yes, then the issue is either with your gas tank or the gas hose.\nIf not, then connect your heater, but don’t turn it on yet. Is there a hissing sound now? If yes, this would indicate a leak anywhere in your propane heater.\nIf there’s still no hissing sound, light your propane heater. Do you hear the hissing noise now? If you only hear a hissing noise in a running propane heater, then you are safe. The noise you are hearing is the sound of gas flow and is expected.\nWhen I run my Mr. Heater Buddy propane heater, I hear a hissing sound on the low heat setting, but not on the high one. But this is expected.\nHow to fix: If you hear a hissing noise when your heater is disconnected, then you should replace the propane tank with a new one!\nYou can try to hear if the hissing noise happens with a gas hose connected only or even when it’s disconnected. When the gas tank makes a hissing noise on its own, immediately carry it outdoors, since it leaks gas!\nAlso, get a new hose. The connector between the tank and the hose might be damaged.\nBut if you only hear the hissing sound when your heater is connected, then the fault is in your propane heater. And in this case, I recommend getting a new heater, such as this Mr. Heater Buddy(click to see my review).\nPropane heater with a screw-on bottle. Hissing noise comes from an improper connection between propane tank or bottle, and the propane heater.\nWhat if your propane heater is making a different noise? After checking all the possible issues and fixes in your propane heater, it still makes a noise? Or the noise your propane heater is making is not on this list?\nIn this case, I would assume that your propane heater has a different special issue.\nIt’s likely not dangerous, because propane gas leaks always make a hissing sound.\nA different noise could come from old materials making weird noises, grease on your propane heater burning (which would produce a yellow flame), or there could be insects inside your propane heater.\nIn this case, I recommend you check your propane heater again. Make sure that all the parts are clean, the pilot light flame is blue and your propane heater does not contain any loose parts that cause rattling noises.\nTighten all the screws in your propane heater.\nIf it’s still making noise now, then I recommend you get a new propane heater.\nMy favorite model is this Mr. Heater Buddy (click here to view it on amazon).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/propane-heater-making-noise/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour propane heater is making noises and you don’t know how to fix it, or if the noise is normal?

Obviously, how would you circulate the air in your room without this feature?\nYour Dyson fan may have stopped oscillating for several reasons. And usually, the issue is relatively easy to fix.\nTherefore, I will share with you the most common reasons why your Dyson fan isn\u0026rsquo;t oscillating, along with troubleshooting and fixing instructions.\nQuick answer: Dyson heaters usually don’t rotate if there’s still tape on your Dyson fan\u0026rsquo;s base body split section. Additionally, if the fan doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit right in its base and dust accumulates in the oscillation system (oscillation motor), the system won\u0026rsquo;t work and thus won\u0026rsquo;t oscillate.\nCauses and fixes for your Dyson fan not rotating If your Dyson fan doesn\u0026rsquo;t oscillate, you can\u0026rsquo;t circulate the airflow in your room. So, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to find out the reason and fix it.\nSo, I\u0026rsquo;m going to guide you through the troubleshooting process of a Dyson fan that won\u0026rsquo;t oscillate.\n1. Tape on the split section If you recently set up a new Dyson fan and couldn\u0026rsquo;t put it on oscillation, it is highly likely that you didn\u0026rsquo;t unbox it properly.\nYou must have skipped removing the tape around the base (which prevents your fan from oscillating).\nHow to check: On the bottom of your Dyson fan, you will see a split section between the base and body that is taped.\nHow to fix: It\u0026rsquo;s obvious! Take the tap off and let your Dyson fan oscillate.\nUsing the oscillation function on your Dyson fan while there is tape on the base body split section can damage the internal gear. So, make sure to remove the tap before turning it on.\nNew Dyson heaters have tape on this split section\n2. Fan is not assembled correctly If your Dyson fan is not assembled correctly with its base, it will not let your fan oscillate.\nActually, the component which allows your Dyson fan to oscillate is the oscillation system (motor).\nSo, when you don\u0026rsquo;t assemble your Dyson fan correctly, the oscillation system also will not connect properly.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why your fan will not be able to move.\nHow to check: Check if all parts are locked at the right point and aren\u0026rsquo;t loose. If they\u0026rsquo;re loose, then you\u0026rsquo;ve found the problem.\nHow to fix: Detach the fan, and try to assemble it again, but this time, make sure every part is locked at the right point.\nWhile detaching your Dyson fan, check whether internal components are correctly connected.\n3. Remote control issue If you\u0026rsquo;re done trying both of the above fixes, and the issue still persists, I doubt that your remote control is not communicating well with your Dyson fan.\nThere could be an issue with your remote, or maybe you\u0026rsquo;re not pointing it rightly toward your Dyson fan.\nHow to check: Point your remote from the front toward the eye of your fan, and see if it works. In addition, check the batteries of your remote.\nHow to fix: Replace your batteries and point your remote straight toward your fan at a suitable distance.\nIf your issue still persists, there is a fault in the PCB of your remote. So, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend saying goodbye to your old remote and getting a new one.\n4. Faulty oscillation motor The oscillation motor is the main thing responsible for rotating your Dyson fan.\nSo, if there is a fault in the oscillation motor of a Dyson fan, it is likely that the fan will fail to oscillate.\nHow to check: If there is an issue with the oscillation motor of your Dyson fan, you\u0026rsquo;ll hear an unusual noise from the motor or no noise at all.\nHow to fix: You can get your oscillation motor repaired if there is minor damage. But I\u0026rsquo;d recommend replacing the motor, as there is a high chance that your oscillation system may not work to its fullest after several repairs. While connecting a new oscillation motor, make sure to check the connections carefully.\n6. Dust blocking the rotor Dust particles are the worst enemies of any electrical device, as they jeopardize the performance of electrical components.\nThe same is the case with a Dyson fan. Dust particles can potentially cause a Dyson fan to stop oscillating if they accumulate in the oscillation motor.\nHow to check: If you haven\u0026rsquo;t cleaned your Dyson heater in months, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to check it (It\u0026rsquo;s undoubtedly a reason). However, you can check if there is dust in your Dyson fan by simply detaching its body.\nHow to fix: Clean your Dyson fan internally and externally, and repeat the process frequently. You can clean your Dyson fan using a brush, brush with a small vacuum cleaner, or a piece of cloth. Make sure to clean your fan gently.\n7. Calibration Cycle Interference For some Dyson fan models, especially those with heating functions like the Pure Hot+Cool fans, an often-overlooked cause of oscillation issues relates to the unit\u0026rsquo;s calibration cycle.\nWhen you activate the heating mode, these fans undergo a calibration cycle to ensure optimal performance.\nDuring the calibration period, the oscillation function is temporarily disabled.\nThis is a safety and efficiency feature, not a defect. Many users, unaware of this feature, might mistakenly assume their fan is malfunctioning when it refuses to oscillate immediately after switching to the heater mode.\nHow to check: When you switch your Dyson fan to heating mode, allow it some time to complete its calibration cycle. The manual typically mentions this process.\nHow to fix: Patience is key here. Simply wait for the calibration cycle to finish. Once it\u0026rsquo;s done, the oscillation function should resume working as normal. If you\u0026rsquo;re using the remote control or app and the oscillation doesn\u0026rsquo;t engage, wait until the calibration is complete before trying again.\nUnderstanding your Dyson fan\u0026rsquo;s unique features, like this calibration cycle, can save you from unnecessary worries and troubleshooting. Always refer to your model\u0026rsquo;s manual for specific operational characteristics.\nA convenient workaround is to start the oscillating in cool mode, then simply hit the heat button. The fan will then automatically start oscillating again following the calibration.\nWhat to do if your Dyson fan is still not oscillating? If, after trying everything that I mentioned in this article, you still couldn\u0026rsquo;t get your Dyson fan to oscillate, then it\u0026rsquo;s time to replace your old Dyson fan.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s new, you can contact Dyson support (they would help you), but if it\u0026rsquo;s old, broken, or gone through several repairs, it\u0026rsquo;s time to get a new fan.\nI recommend getting a new fan. The Dyson Pure Cool Link TP02 (click to see it on amazon) is a good choice . It\u0026rsquo;s my favorite because of its price, quality, reliability, and amazing features (purifier, Wifi enabled, and auto mode).\nAlso, you can sell your broken Dyson fan online to get some money (some people buy broken electronics to repair and flip them).\nHow to control and adjust the oscillation of my Dyson fan? To control and adjust the oscillation of your Dyson fan, follow these steps:\nFind the oscillation control button on the base or remote control (if your Dyson fan has a remote control). Press the oscillation button to turn the oscillation on or off. Not all Dyson fans have an oscillation adjustment feature. If your fan has this feature, you can adjust the oscillation angle by using the left and right arrow buttons on the remote control. Some Dyson fans have built-in timers that allow you to set the oscillation to turn off after a specific time. You can set this using the timer control button.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/dyson-fan-not-rotating/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s frustrating to find out that your Dyson fan is no longer rotating.

After reading this article, you will know what to do to fix your propane heater.\nI’ve listed the most common causes for your propane heater not staying lit along with an explanation, and a way to test for and fix each cause.\nQuick answer: Propane heaters usually keep shutting off and don’t stay lit because of a dirty pilot light or thermocouple. A thorough cleaning of your pilot light with rubbing alcohol and a Q-tip should fix it. Also, ensure your gas line has no kinks and you don’t move it while heating. If this doesn’t work, a triggered safety mechanism such as tip-over protection or overheat protection could be the cause.\nCauses and fixes for your propane heater shutting off The first thing we’re going to look at is your propane heater’s pilot light. This will fix 90% of propane heater issues.\nWhat is a pilot light and how does it work? A pilot light is a small flame that runs on gas that is branched off the main gas line. The pilot light accomplishes two things:\nIt lights the larger gas line Your heater uses the small pilot light to verify the quality of the flame Your pilot light is basically the mechanism your heater uses to test the ignition and burn.\nThe pilot light consists of three main components\nPilot light hose Thermocouple Igniter The pilot light hose is the gas line that supplies the pilot light with gas. A thermocouple is a very simple electric thermometer. And the igniter ignites the gas.\nThe thermocouple measures the temperature of the gas flame. And only if the gas flame is hot enough, it signals a gas valve to open the main gas line.\nThis pilot light is too small to reach the thermocouple (sitting opposite the flame)\nVice versa, if the pilot light’s flame is not hot enough, then your propane heater won’t light. Or it might light but it shuts off after some time.\nThe pilot light is a safety mechanism. If the small pilot light does not burn properly, then your heater assumes that the main heating panels would not burn properly as well.\nTo save gas and prevent an inefficient burn, the pilot light’s thermocouple shuts down the heating.\nWhat can’t be the cause for your propane heater not staying lit? Your propane heater does not stay lit and keeps shutting off. There’s one useful piece of information in this sentence: Your propane heater turns on.\nThis means we can assume (for now) that your propane gas tank and the gas line hose are intact.\nAlso, we know that your igniter is not the problem.\nAlso, we know that the initial flame from the pilot light is hot enough to open the main gas line valve. Only after some time does your heater shut off.\nSo, it is very likely that your pilot light’s flame quality reduces.\nLet’s have a look at this first.\n1. Pilot light gas opening is clogged When your pilot light’s gas opening is clogged, the flame coming out of it will not burn properly.\nUsually, the reason for this is that you use a large (\u0026gt;20lb) propane tank without a propane gas filter. A filter collects all of the oil coming out of the hose. Lots of gas hoses contain oil (so they ironically don’t clog).\nBut after some time, the pressure from your tank pushes the oil into your pilot light’s gas line, where it clogs up.\nHow to test: Check the gas opening of your propane heater’s pilot light. Touch the inside, or rub it with a Q-tip. Is it greasy? If yes, then you found the issue.\nHow to fix: Clean the pilot light’s opening with a Q-tip and rubbing alcohol. The alcohol dissolves the grease and helps you remove it.\nAfter a thorough clean, try to run your heater. It should work without shutting off!\nIf it does not work, continue with the next cause.\n2. Thermocouple collects soot A clean thermocouple is just as important as a clean pilot light. Let’s see what you can do here:\nHow to test: Turn on your propane heater’s pilot light. Is the flame blue or yellow? If it’s yellow, this indicates a dirty pilot light hose and you should double-check that your pilot light gas line is clean.\nIf, however, your pilot light’s flame is blue and the flame is large enough to reach the thermocouple, this indicates a faulty thermocouple.\nThe simplest cause is dirt or soot collecting on your thermocouple. After turning off the propane heater, wipe a handkerchief (or your finger) over the (now cold) thermocouple. Is it dirty?\nHow to fix: Again, rubbing alcohol is the best solution. Clean the thermocouple with rubbing alcohol and a Q-tip or tissue.\nTry running your propane heater. Does it work without shutting off now?\nThe thermocouple is the sensor sitting opposite the pilot light flame\n3. Thermocouple is broken or has a loose contact Another potential cure for your propane heater that keeps shutting off could be a broken thermocouple.\nThe thermocouple is a very simple temperature sensor consisting of just two wires. Normally, they don’t break. But if yours is faulty (for example if it has a loose contact), then it could keep shutting off your propane heater.\nHow to test: There’s no good test for a broken thermocouple unless you can measure its voltage somehow. There is, however, an easy test for loose contact in a thermocouple.\nBefore turning on your propane heater, wiggle the thermocouple. Try to run your propane heater.\nIf its behavior changes after you wiggle it, then a loose contact is a likely reason.\nHow to fix: If it’s a simple loose contact, try to screw your thermocouple tighter. If that doesn’t help you can buy this replacement thermocouple (click here to view it on amazon). This replacement thermocouple should fit most propane heaters. It is a 30mV thermocouple, so make sure your heater’s thermocouple is 30mV as well.\n4. Inconsistent gas pressure Your propane heater runs on gas. Theoretically, the heating will stop when the gas supply reduces or stop, even if it’s just for a moment.\nIf your heater does not receive gas even for a second, then the pilot light’s flame shrinks, which reduces the temperature your thermocouple measures. Then, the thermocouple closes the main gas valve.\nI suspect that in this case, the main heat should start again once the gas pressure increases again.\nHowever, this depends on how your propane heater is designed.\nHow to test: Turn your propane heater on. While it’s running, make sure it does not move!\nDoes it turn off on its own? If it does, then inconsistent gas pressure should not be the reason. However, if it does not turn off, then try moving the gas hose a little. Does it turn off now? If yes, this indicates that your gas hose is sensitive to movement and affects the gas supply.\nThis often happens when there\u0026rsquo;s a kink in the hose. In one position, the gas supply works, but when you move the hose a little, the kink closes up the gas and increases the internal hose pressure, which reduces the gas pressure your propane heater receives.\nHow to fix: Replace your gas hose with a new one. I would recommend this propane gas hose (click here to view it on amazon).\nPlease note that this hose is 5 feet in length. If you need a longer hose than that, then select another length (it’s available in different sizes).\n5. Tip-over protection activates Oftentimes, propane heaters have built-in safety mechanisms. That’s not the case for all propane heaters, but I’d say for most.\nThe issue could be that you turn on your heater and it’s running fine. But only when you move it, it shuts off.\nUsually, this is a good thing, since carrying a burning propane heater is not very safe. Also, tip-over protection prevents fires when kids or pets tip over your propane heater.\nHow to test: Turn on your propane heater. When it’s burning, lift it up and rotate it a bit. You should hear a clicking sound (the tip-over protection triggering) and you see that the heater turns off.\nHow to fix: Don’t move your heater after turning it on. When you need to move it, turn it off first and only light it at the target location.\n6. Propane heater overheats Another built-in protection mechanism is the overheat protection. Overheat protection shuts a heater off when it overheats.\nPropane heaters usually overheat if they stand close to objects that block or reflect the heat.\nHow to test: Place your propane heater in the middle of the room. No other object should stand close to it. Light the heater and wait for a few minutes. Does it shut off?\nWhat happens if you place your propane heater facing toward a stone wall? Does it shut off then?\nIf your propane heater shuts off after you move other objects closer to it, then overheating is likely.\nHow to fix: You can fix your propane heater overheating by placing it in a spot free of obstructions. The heater should face away from the walls and into the room.\n7. Heater’s main gas line is clogged This one is the worst case. If your propane heater still shuts off by itself, even though you tried all of the fixes listed above, then the issue is very likely somewhere in the main gas line.\nHow to test: Perform all of the fixes listed in this article. Run your propane heater. Does it keep shutting off?\nIf yes, then a clogged main gas line could be the cause. Your propane heater initially lights, but after some time, it stops working. This could be because the dirt and grease in your heater’s gas line accumulate in one spot with increasing running time.\nYour propane heater initially lights up because the grease settled. After turning your heater on, the oil, grease, and dirt take some time to clog up the gas line.\nHow to fix: To fix a clogged main gas line, I recommend a complete disassembly of your propane heater.\nBefore you do that, turn the heater off and disconnect the gas tank. Disassemble all the gas lines. Then, use a wire brush and rubbing alcohol to clean the inside of the gas lines. Reassemble everything and try running your heater.\nWhat to do if your propane heater still does not work? You tried all of the fixes and your propane heater still doesn’t work? Then, I recommend you get a new heater.\nYou really tried everything to fix it.\nMy recommended propane heater is the Mr. Heater Buddy (click here to view it on amazon). You can also get its larger variant, the Mr. Heater Big Buddy.\nI’ve written a review about both of them, including how long they last on a propane tank.\nCheck it out here: My favorite Propane Heater\nAlternatively, if you are looking for a permanent propane heater (not a portable one), then I recommend you have a look at this article: Best Ventless Propane Heaters\nMy favorite heater on this list is a wall-mounted propane heater!\nConclusion You can fix almost all propane heater problems by cleaning clogged components with rubbing alcohol.\nThe key is just to find out which component is clogged. Usually, it’s the pilot light’s gas line.\nIf this isn’t it, clean the thermocouple and the main gas line.\nYou can also replace the thermocouple with a new one.\nMake sure that the gas hose connecting the propane heater with the propane tank has no kinks!\nAnd, of course, you should make sure that you trigger none of the safety mechanisms (overheat protection, tip-over protection).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/propane-heater-keeps-shutting-off/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour propane heater turns on but keeps shutting off?

However, it is very unlikely as long as you vent your room every few hours. Ventless space heaters are among the most common source of carbon monoxide poisoning in homes. Modern ventless heaters are designed not to produce CO when functioning properly, but many factors, including poor ventilation and dirt, can make the heater less than safe.\nBecause of no vent pipe or chimney, vent-free space heaters are easy and inexpensive to install, you can move them easily, and they are quite efficient. More importantly, ventless heaters heat up a room quickly and quietly. They do not require electricity, so they are suitable for emergency blackouts since gas is cheaply available in most areas.\nBut all these advantages are a far cry from the dangers this type of ventless heater poses.\nHow Ventless Gas Heaters Produce CO Again, the best ventless gas heaters are designed to produce minute amounts of carbon monoxide when maintained and adjusted properly.\nCarbon monoxide occurs due to incomplete combustion caused by insufficient oxygen. Modern heaters come with an oxygen depletion sensor (ODS) that shuts down the heater if oxygen levels go below 18%. For reference, normal oxygen levels remain around 21%.\nIf everything is well done, normal by-products of burning gas and fuel are carbon dioxide, water vapor, and some nitrogen dioxide, which are all released into the room instead of being led outdoors via a chimney pipe.\nUnfortunately, the ODS does not respond to a lack of oxygen caused by the accumulation of dust inside the heater, improper gas pressure, rust in the burner, disruption of the burner by air currents, and improper placement of artificial logs in a fireplace.\nThis means it’s possible for a ventless heater to continue working even when it’s not getting enough oxygen for ideal combustion, hence producing carbon monoxide.\nA lot of care must be taken to ensure the heater is working perfectly at all times, and it’s impossible to know when something is amiss sometimes. For this reason, approximately 48 people are killed by carbon monoxide poisoning produced by fuel-burning heaters.\nOther Dangers of Ventless Gas Heaters As it turns out, carbon monoxide poisoning is the least of your worries when dealing with a ventless gas heater. This is because the other by-products of burning gas aren\u0026rsquo;t that safe either. And since they are being released directly into the air you breathe, you may want to take a few precautions before turning on a ventless heater.\nCarbon dioxide. This is a non-toxic gas that makes the biggest percentage of by-products resulting from burning gas. At such high concentrations, however, CO2 causes headaches, sleepiness, and a stuffy atmosphere in the house. This is the main reason why people who use fuel space heaters wake up with a headache every morning. Water vapor. A 30,000 BTU/h ventless heater produces 1.3 liters of water per hour. Too much water vapor in your house elevates the humidity level, leading to condensation on your walls, window panes, concrete slabs, and ceilings. This dampness will encourage mold development, wood rot, and deterioration of other parts of the house, including furniture. Nitrogen dioxide. Like CO, nitrogen dioxide is a toxic gas which, at low concentrations, causes upper respiratory issues such as sore throat, headaches, nausea and coughing. This gas also causes asthma. Any burning flame produces NO2, and the quantity is based on the size and design of the heater. How to improve your ventless heater\u0026rsquo;s safety First things first, an unvented gas heater is designed for supplemental use only. This means a few hours when the power goes out, or your generator is on break. It cannot be your regular heat source, and you MUST not operate it for more than 4 hours at a time.\nAside from that,\nUse only approved gas heaters with an ODS pilot. This will take care of the room oxygen issue and shut off the heater if oxygen levels are low.\nGet professional installation All gas heaters should be installed by a professional. They are aware of the hazards, and you need their input to choose the right-sized heater for your house. A 3800 BTU/hr ventless heater is the largest you can use in a tight 10 by 20 room.\nEven if you are buying a portable gas heater, a professional will assess the house for the best position to place it based on ventilation access and adjust everything to perfection.\nVentilation Fuel heaters consume a lot of oxygen during combustion. This means the oxygen in your room will only suffice with proper ventilation. With today\u0026rsquo;s tight houses, keep a window open in the room to allow oxygen in freely and eliminate the CO2, NO2, and water vapor released.\nThat said, do not use an unvented gas heater in confined places like small bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchen.\nFollow all operation and maintenance instructions Depending on the design of the ventless heater, follow all the operation instructions to the letter. These include ventilation, placing the artificial logs properly in a fireplace, proper adjustment, and so on.\nMaintenance-wise, ensure you clean the heater at least twice a year, or as instructed in the owner’s manual. It’s also important to have the heater checked and readjusted by a professional annually to rule out aging issues like burner rust and improper gas pressure.\nInstall a UL-listed carbon monoxide detector Because it’s almost impossible to know when the heater is producing carbon monoxide, always have a digital CO detector listed as sensitive in the room. The detector will go off when CO levels go over 70ppm for an hour or so, or 400ppm for over 4 minutes.\nHowever, this is a high concentration for pregnant women, sick people, and babies. Instead of waiting for the detector alarm to go off, keep a close eye on how you feel when a ventless heater is on. A slight headache, nausea, or breathlessness should necessitate shutting down the heater.\nFinal Thoughts While the design of new ventless gas heaters makes carbon monoxide production very low, they are still quite dangerous. The chances of CO poisoning are higher than any other type of heater, not to mention all the other by-products are also released in the room.\nTo make things worse, the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association says it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to create comfortable temperatures with a correctly sized ventless heater because of the required ventilation. A larger heater would pollute the air beyond allowable levels.\nKnowing that it\u0026rsquo;s better to invest in a good vented space heater, electrical space heater, or an outdoor generator for heating.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-ventless-heaters-cause-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you get CO poisoning from a ventless heater?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick answer: \u003cstrong\u003eYes, you can \u003cem\u003etheoretically\u003c/em\u003e get carbon monoxide poisoning from a ventless heater.

Fixing a Mr. Heater that does not turn on is usually simple.\nIn this article, you’re going to learn how to get your Mr. Heater running again.\nQuick answer: You can fix your Mr. Heater Buddy not lighting by cleaning the pilot light opening with a Q-tip and rubbing alcohol. Also, firmly smack your Mr. Heater 5-10 times. If gas comes out of the pilot light opening, but your heater does not spark, use a lighter to ignite the gas. Replace the igniter in the long run.\nCauses and Fixes for your Mr. Heater Buddy not lighting Mr. Heater Buddy propane heaters have a built-in safety mechanism. The pilot light heats up a thermocouple sensor. A thermocouple is just an electric thermometer.\nThe thermocouple constantly monitors the temperature of the pilot light’s flame. If the flame is not hot enough, the Mr. Heater Buddy heater does not open the gas valve to start the heating panels.\nWhy is that?\nThe pilot light indicates the state of the propane combustion. If the pilot light doesn’t burn properly, that’s a sign that something is wrong with the heater.\nAs a safety mechanism, the gas valve closes. That’s to protect you from incomplete propane combustion, which could result in carbon monoxide production and significantly more inefficient heating.\nThat’s the usual cause for a Mr. Heater Buddy not igniting. Let’s have a look at what can cause this problem and how to fix it.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the thermocouple.\nDirty pilot light opening Oftentimes, the pilot light gas opening is dirty. When this orifice is dirty, propane can’t properly pass through it and you don’t get the expected blue flame.\nUsually, this is very simple to test and fix.\nHow to test: Turn your Mr. Heater Buddy’s pilot light on. Which color is the flame coming out of it? If it’s yellow, your pilot light does not receive enough propane (or air). Also, if your pilot light is blue but too short to reach the thermocouple (opposite the pilot light opening), that’s a sign of a dirty pilot light opening.\nHow to fix: Take off the front guard of your Mr. Heater Buddy.\nUse Q-tips and rubbing alcohol to clean the pilot light opening. You need to use rubbing alcohol because the most common form of dirt in a pilot light is oil and grease.\nAfter a thorough clean, try to turn on your propane heater. The pilot light should not burn blue. And you should be able to switch on the heating panels.\nThe pilot light is the opening where the flame comes out!\nHow to prevent this in the future: The oil in your pilot light comes from using a propane hose line without a filter.\nThe reason for the oil in your gas line is that propane is a byproduct of crude oil. Because it is not refined perfectly, propane will always contain a tiny fraction of oil. Over time, the oil accumulates in the hose and inside your pilot light.\nAlso, oftentimes, many new hoses contain oil as well. I think it’s to prevent clogging and the inner sides of the hose from sticking together.\nAnd at some point, it clogs the pilot light.\nTo prevent this from happening in the future, I recommend using this inline propane filter (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt’s an original Mr. Heater product. And it connects directly to the heater.\nYou should replace the propane filter once every year, or every two years, depending on your usage. So, I’d just buy a set of 3 to be prepared.\n“This item is absolutely necessary to run your Buddy Heater off of a larger propane tank. Extension hoses will allow tiny bits of the rubber to break loose and clog the heater. This filter prevents that and extends the life of your heater.”\na reviewer on amazon\nIf you are running your Mr. Heater Buddy on 1lb propane bottles only (and not off larger tanks), then you don’t need an inline propane filter. The issue happens only with the bigger 20lb tanks and the hose that you use to connect the tank and your Mr. Heater.\nSensor behind off-button stuck There is a sensor behind the off-button on the back side of Mr. Heater Buddy heaters.\nWhen this sensor is stuck, your heater can’t turn on anymore.\nThe fix for this is funny, but it really works.\nHow to check: You can only really check for this issue by testing the fix and seeing if it works afterward. So, check out the fix:\nHow to fix: Hold your Mr. Heater Buddy in one hand and smack it firmly 5-10 times with the other hand. Then push the off-button a dozen times. Try to turn on the pilot light and then turn on the heating. It should work now!\nHow to prevent it in the future: Unfortunately, there is no good preventative action for the stuck sensor issue. It seems to be a fragile aspect in the otherwise good Mr. Heater products.\nAnyways, just keep in mind that you should smack your heater when it does not do as you wish and see if it works then.\n( I wish you could solve more life problems this way … )\n“Mine hasn’t worked in a year. I brought it home last weekend to work on it. I slapped it around 8-10 times. Pushed the off button 15 times, screwed a bottle on it and it lit right up.”\na texasbowhunter member\nIgniter broken Another possible reason for your Mr. Heater not lighting is that the igniter doesn’t work. Of course, you need the igniter to work to light the gas. So, here’s what you can do.\nHow to test: Try to spark the igniter. Does it work?\nHow to fix: For now, you can try the following workaround. Since it’s only your igniter that is not working, but propane still leaves your pilot light’s hose, you can light the gas using a lighter.\nOnce the pilot light burns, you should be able to switch on the heating.\nOf course, this is not a real fix for the problem, but it’s a good workaround.\nTo fix your igniter properly, you likely need to replace it. You can try to find an original Mr. Heater replacement igniter or any generic electric igniter for this.\nUntil you fix it, just carry a lighter with you and light your Mr. Heater Buddy manually.\nDefective thermocouple Even though thermocouples are very durable devices (they are basically just bent pieces of wire), they can break in practice.\nIt might be the case that your thermocouple oxidized or overheated, or broke due to impact. Normally, this should not happen, but it can.\nHow to test: Disassemble your Mr. Heater and remove the thermocouple. With a sensitive voltmeter (that can measure to mV-precision), measure the voltage of the thermocouple’s two strands of wire.\nMeasure the voltage of the thermocouple with and without flame exposure (for example from a lighter). The voltage should increase with temperature.\nIf it doesn’t, your thermocouple is broken.\nHowever, there could be an issue in the connection point of your thermocouple that you can’t check by disconnected measuring. This issue would only occur when the thermocouple is built into the Mr. Heater Buddy. Then, you should check if the voltage from your thermocouple reaches another point in your Mr. Heater’s circuit.\nHow to fix: Testing a broken thermocouple is actually a lot more difficult than fixing it. So, if you don’t have the devices to test your thermocouple, then you can simply try to replace your thermocouple and see if your Mr. Heater lights.\nI recommend this Mr. Heater replacement thermocouple(click here to view it on amazon).\nWhat to do if your Mr. Heater Buddy still does not light? If your Mr. Heater Buddy still does not work, then I’d suggest getting a new one.\nYou can usually sell the defective model online. There are hobbyists who buy broken propane heaters and try to fix and flip them.\nOf course, Mr. Heater Buddies are still the best propane heaters out there. That’s why I recommend you just buy the same model again.\nThis Mr. Heater Buddy propane heater (click here to view it on amazon) is my favorite.\nConclusion You can fix 95% of Mr. Heater Buddy heaters by cleaning the pilot light opening with rubbing alcohol and a Q-tip.\nIf it doesn’t work after that, smack your Mr. Heater Buddy heater with your open palm and try running it again.\nI hope this article helped you!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-a-mr-heater-buddy-not-lighting/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour Mr. Heater Buddy is not lighting?

In this article, we’re going to answer this question by checking the temperature a propane heater produces. Then we can conclude, whether propane heaters cause a fire.\nThen, we will follow up with a look at the combustion of propane gas and whether it creates any toxic waste materials.\nAfter checking all of these “scary” aspects of propane heaters, you’re going to learn how to use a propane heater safely. And I am going to recommend you my favorite indoor-safe propane heater!\nQuick answer: Yes, propane heaters are safe indoors! Propane heaters can emit enough heat to ignite household things (wood, curtains, carpets). So, it is important that you place your propane heater in a corner free of any obstructions blocking the heat. As long as your propane heater openly radiates into your living space, they are perfectly safe. If you have pets at home, you should rather use electric space heaters with hidden heating elements.\nSummary: Safe and unsafe indoor propane heaters There are different types of propane heaters. Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick summary of whether they are safe to use indoors:\nHeater type****Is this propane heater safe indoors?Portable propane heatersafeVentless propane heatersafeVented propane heatersafeTank top heaterunsafePatio heaterunsafeTorpedo heaterunsafe\nPortable propane heaters as well as ventless and vented propane heaters are usually designed for indoor use. They come with many safety features and don\u0026rsquo;t expose any flames.\nTank top heaters are not safe, because they usually don\u0026rsquo;t have any safety mechanisms. Patio heaters get way too hot for indoor spaces.\nAnd torpedo heaters emit flames and produce temperatures high enough for industrial applications and construction sites.\nHow hot do propane heaters get? Propane burns at a temperature of 5108°F ( 2,820°C). That’s the temperature of the blue flame itself.\nThe temperature decays with increasing distance. You can expect the temperature of a propane heater to be between 1,000°F and 2,000°F within the first 5 inches in front of the open heating area.\nIn comparison with a regular electric space heater, that’s very hot.\nAn electric space heater’s heating element is “only” 750°F. And an oil-filled radiator\u0026rsquo;s surface temperature is only around 180°F.\nCan propane heaters ignite anything? Yes, propane heaters can get hot enough to ignite things standing right in front of them.\nThe temperature right in front of a propane heater is between 1,000°F and 2,000°F.\nThat’s enough to ignite most plastic materials, as well as most fabrics of which carpets and curtains are made.\nAlso, temperatures between 1,000°F and 2,000°F can spontaneously ignite solid wood. The spontaneous ignition temperature of wood is around 1,100°F.\nThe exact temperature your propane heater emits depends, of course, on the heater model, the settings, and the design of the heating elements.\nFor example, propane heaters that have visible flames tend to produce higher temperatures than propane heaters that use an embedded propane flame to heat a metal grid, which in turn radiates the heat.\nThis does not change the heat output (measured in BTU per hour) of your propane heater. It just affects the heat distribution of your propane heater and thus the temperature immediately in front of it.\nTo conclude this section, you can assume the following:\nAll propane heaters emit temperatures that are hot enough to ignite most household items if you place them too close together.\nDo propane heaters emit toxic gases? Burning propane is a chemical reaction between the propane gas itself and the oxygen in your room.\nIdeally, if your propane heater is adjusted properly and you have enough oxygen in your room, the combustion results in the formation of carbon dioxide and water vapor.\nHowever, if the combustion is incomplete, propane burning can result in carbon monoxide and aldehyde production. Both aldehydes and carbon monoxide are toxic.\nYou always get this incomplete combustion when the balance of propane and oxygen is off. Ideally, it should be 1 part propane and 24 parts air.\nSo, what do you have to do to ensure that your propane heater burns properly and does not emit toxic gases?\nThe easiest thing is to regularly vent your room every few hours.\nEven opening the window for just a minute already makes a big difference.\nIn general, I’d say that the risk of toxic gases when running a propane heater is very low, since there is always a way for air to enter your room.\nAir enters your room through tiny gaps in the window and through the gaps below your closed door. Also, when you leave your room and open the door for a few seconds, this already exchanges air with neighboring rooms.\nAre propane heaters safe around kids and pets? So far we’ve seen that propane heaters can get very hot and that they can emit toxic gases (if you run them in rooms with little oxygen).\nAnother potential issue is kids and pets.\nKids and pets have all kinds of funny ideas. Also, they don’t act reasonably (at least I didn’t when I was a kid). So, running a propane heater around them is not a good idea.\nKids and pets can burn their fingers or their fur in front of running propane heaters.\nAnd on top of that, they can start a fire if they tip over a propane heater without built-in tip-over protection.\nBecause of their exposed heating elements and the high temperatures, propane heaters are not safe around small children and pets.\nWhen I tip my propane heater, it immediately shuts off\nHow to safely use a propane heater indoors To safely run a propane heater indoors, you will have to minimize its fire and toxic gas risk.\nHere’s how you can do that:\nHow to minimize toxic gas production To minimize the production of aldehydes and carbon monoxide, you should regularly vent your room.\nYou can either do that by opening the window or by opening the door.\nVenting refills your room’s oxygen levels, which ensures clean propane combustion.\nMake the heater inaccessible to kids and pets You can mount your propane heater at an elevated point to the wall, so it’s inaccessible to kids and pets.\nAlternatively, you can build a pedestal to place your propane heater on, or you can at least run it from any other elevated position in your room.\nThat works for most pets and children, with the exception of cats. For cats, you will need a wall-mounted propane heater, or a safer space heater type such as an oil-filled radiator.\nLeave the space in front of your propane heater open The space right in front of your propane heater always has to be open! Never place any objects within 2-3 feet in front of your propane heater.\nThis eliminates the risk of fire.\nOf course, you can quickly heat something up, or dry clothes for a few minutes. Or you can warm your hands on the propane heater.\nAs long as whatever you’re putting in front of your heater is only temporarily there and you constantly watch it, it’s okay.\nBut never place something in front of your heater and leave it unobserved.\nUse a safe propane heater There are different types of propane heaters. Some are really unsafe, such as torpedo heaters or tank top heaters, while others are specifically designed for indoor use.\nOf course, you should stick to indoor propane heaters.\nIndoor propane heaters come with all kinds of safety features. The Mr. Heater Big Buddy (click here to view it on amazon) has everything you need:\nIt’s portable. It can easily heat any room, even large living rooms with a high ceiling. It has different temperature settings.\nAnd it has a built-in oxygen sensor, which shuts off the heating when there’s too little oxygen in your room. This makes the formation of toxic waste gases impossible.\nThat’s why I always recommend this propane heater. In my review, I included a list of how long a propane tank lasts with this heater.\nCheck it out here: Mr. Heater Big Buddy review (click to read it)\nA realistic conclusion on propane heater safety Wow, … I am a bit surprised myself after writing this article.\nAnalyzing the risks of propane heaters makes them appear so dangerous.\nHowever, I have to emphasize one thing:\nPropane heaters are completely safe indoors as long as you use them reasonably!\nYes, it might sound scary that they can get \u0026gt;1,000°F. But so what?\nJust reduce your heater’s temperature setting if that’s too much for you.\nAlso, yes, the potential carbon monoxide emissions might also sound scary. But so what? Just vent your room every once in a while.\nA tealight reaches the same temperature and also has a risk of carbon monoxide production. And you usually don’t consider tealights a threat.\nThere is a reason that propane heaters are such a popular backup heat source.\nAnd in my honest opinion, you really have to challenge your luck to enforce a propane heater fire.\nIt’s very unlikely as modern propane heaters are very safe.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-propane-heaters-safe-indoors/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre propane heaters safe for indoor use?

But can you use a surge protector with your space heater?\nWell, we can\u0026rsquo;t answer this with a yes or no, because there are certain things you need to consider before using a surge protector with a space heater.\nIn this article, I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you if you should use a surge protector with your heater. Also, I\u0026rsquo;m going to do some calculations that will make it easy for you to choose the suitable surge protector for your space heater.\nQuick answer: Yes, you can use a surge protector with your space heater. In the US, you can use a 15A surge protector with your space heater, but make sure your space heater\u0026rsquo;s power consumption does not exceed 1800 watts. You can\u0026rsquo;t run a 2,000 watts space heater on a 15A circuit in the US anyways, so not being able to use a surge protector for this rating is not an issue.\nIn Europe and the UK, you can use a 15A surge protector with almost all space heaters. However, you don\u0026rsquo;t need a surge protector with your space heater, as heating elements of space heaters can easily handle power surges.\nCan you use a surge protector with a space heater? Yes, you can use a surge protector with your space heater if it can withstand the current your space heater draws.\nFor example, if your space heater draws a 13A current, the surge protector should withstand more than a 13A current. In that case, a surge protector with a 15A ampere rating would work for you.\nAlright, before it gets confusing for you, I\u0026rsquo;m going to do some calculations to make it easy.\nCan you use a 15A surge protector with your space heater? Now, I\u0026rsquo;m going to see if I can use a 15A surge protector for different space heaters (power consumption).\nFor calculations, I\u0026rsquo;m going to use a simple formula.\nP (power consumption) = V (outlet voltage) x I (the current your space heater draws)\nNow, if we have our space heater\u0026rsquo;s power consumption and our region\u0026rsquo;s outlet voltage, then we can easily calculate the current our space heater would draw.\nAlso, I\u0026rsquo;ll calculate the current for both the US and Europe regions because, in both regions, outlet voltage is different, i.e. 110V-120V, and 220V-230v, respectively.\nHeater power****Can you use a surge protector?

(Europe \u0026amp; UK - 230V circuit)****800 WattsYes (draws 6.66 amps)Yes (draws 3.47 amps)1,000 WattsYes (draws 8.33 amps)Yes (draws 4.34 amps)1,500 WattsYes (draws 12.5 amps)Yes (draws 6.52 amps)2,000 WattsNo (draws 16.66 amps)Yes (draws 8.69 amps)\nSo, for Europe and the UK region, it\u0026rsquo;s totally fine to use a 15A surge protector with your space heater.\nBut, for the US region, you can\u0026rsquo;t run your space heater with a surge protector if your heater\u0026rsquo;s power consumption exceeds 1800 watts.\nTypically, 1500 watts space heaters are used, so in that case, it\u0026rsquo;s completely fine to use a surge protector.\nSo, now you\u0026rsquo;re well aware that you can run your space heater with a surge protector.\nBut there are other crucial things you should notice if you want to use an effective surge protector with your heater.\nSuppressed voltage rating of the surge protector (clamping voltage). Response time of the surge protector. Joule rating of the surge protector. Suppressed voltage rating of the surge protector When you see the packaging of the surge protector, you may notice a clamping voltage or suppressed voltage rating on it.\nNow, let me explain it to you.\nAt the beginning of this article, I mentioned that a surge protector saves your devices from a voltage spike.\nSo, the suppressed voltage rating tells us how much of a voltage our surge protector can suppress and transfer to the ground to save the device from the spike.\nUsually, surge protectors come with 330V-4000V clamping voltage. ( source)\nSo, the key is simple. We should select a surge protector with minimum clamping voltage so that when there is a spike, it transfers the exceeding voltage to the ground.\nThis is why clamping voltage is also called let-through voltage. If the clamping voltage is high, it will pass the exceeding voltage to your space heater, causing it to be damaged.\nResponse time of the surge protector When a voltage increase lasts longer than three nanoseconds (billionths of a second), it is called a transient voltage or power surge. An increase lasting less than three nanoseconds is called a spike.\nSurge protectors don\u0026rsquo;t respond immediately to power surges, as there is a slight delay. Your space heater will be exposed to the surge for a more extended period if the response time of your surge protector is more.\nChoose a surge protector that responds in less than one nanosecond.\nJoule rating of the surge protector Joule is an energy measurement, so the joule rating tells us how much total energy your surge protector can absorb.\nDue to voltage spikes, there will obviously be a power surge, as voltage and power are directly related to each other. (P=VI)\nAs 1W = 1 J/s (1 joule of energy absorbed for a second)\nSo, if there is a power surge of, let\u0026rsquo;s say, 70,000 watts, the surge protector will absorb 70,0000 joules per second.\nTypical surges last for 50 microseconds ( source)\nSo, for 50 microseconds, the surge protector will absorb 3.5 joules. (It\u0026rsquo;s not accurate as we\u0026rsquo;re discussing usual scenarios).\nIn that case, a 30,000-joule surge protector can handle 750-780 power surges. After that, you must replace your surge protector.\nDoes using a surge protector with a space heater make sense? No, you don\u0026rsquo;t really need a surge protector with most space heaters because they are not sensitive devices that break quickly (such as computers).\nMost space heaters have resistance heating elements that can easily withstand voltage spikes and power surges. Usually, you need surge protectors for sensitive devices with electronic components, such as computers, laptops, and TVs.\nSo, I\u0026rsquo;d not recommend using a surge protector with your space heater. But, still, if you want an extra protection layer, I will suggest the best surge protector below.\nWhich surge protector is suitable for heavy-duty devices? The best surge protector or power strip for heavy-duty devices such as space heaters is this Belkin Power Strip Surge Protector (click to view it on amazon) .\nBelkin is my favorite surge protector because it\u0026rsquo;s the best in price, quality, and power absorption rating.\nThis surge protector can absorb 3940 joules (more than enough for your space heater) and withstand 15A. So, for a 1500 watts space heater, this surge protector can efficiently serve the purpose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-use-a-surge-protector-with-a-space-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSurge protectors are the best safety devices to handle voltage spikes and power surges and keep your devices safe.

Which one is better for you? In this article, I am going to introduce you to all the relevant differences between propane and electric heaters!\nAfter reading this article, you will know exactly in which case you should prefer propane heaters over electric heaters and vice versa.\nIt’s actually quite simple.\nQuick answer: Propane heaters are better than electric space heaters for rooms without a heat source or access to electricity. They are cheaper to run and can produce more heat. Meanwhile, electric space heaters don’t need refills and are usually safer.\nPropane vs Electric space heaters: Summary of important differences PropaneElectricRunning cost$35.28 (per million BTU)$87.98 (per million BTU)Heat outputup to 30,000 BTU/hup to 5,100 BTU/hIndoor safetyOKbetween OK (infrared heaters) and very safe (oil-filled radiators)Running time14 daysindefinitely\nNow that you know the key differences, let’s have a look at each of those in a bit more detail:\nPropane heaters work without electricity Let’s start with the simplest one first. Does the space you want to heat have access to electricity?\nIf the answer here is “no”, then your only choice is to use a heater with an independent energy source. In this case, it’s the propane heater.\nPropane heaters are the best choice for heating off-grid spaces, such as cabins, RVs, or off-grid garages.\nAlso, propane heaters are a great backup heat source for electricity outages.\nIf you have access to electricity, then you can theoretically use either a propane heater or an electric heater.\nBecause even when you have access to electricity, electric space heaters aren’t necessarily the better choice.\nNow that we covered the energy source, let’s check your heat requirements.\nWhich heater outputs more heat? In general, electric space heaters produce up to 1,500W of heat. At least, that’s the case for 120V US heaters. In the UK and Europe, space heaters run on 230V outlets and can, therefore, draw more power (up to \u0026gt;3,000W).\nMost electric space heaters, however, are 1,500W models, so that’s our baseline for the comparison.\nThe heat output of propane heaters is measured in BTU(British Thermal Units) per hour.\n1 BTU/h = 0.293W\nYou can convert from BTU/h to Watts by multiplying with 0.293. Conversely, you can convert from Watts to BTU/h by dividing by 0.293.\nSo, 1,500W corresponds to\n1,500W / 0.293 ≈ 5,100 BTU/h\nThis means, an average electric space heater produces up to 5,100 BTU of heat per hour.\nIndoor propane heaters can easily produce more heat than that.\nA basic portable propane heater produces 9,000 BTU/h of heat. A slightly larger version produces 18,000 BTU/h.\nThe largest indoor propane heaters can output up to 30,000 BTU/h. There are even stronger models, but these are usually outdoor heaters such as patio heaters or industrial-grade torpedo heaters.\nRoom sizes you can heat with propane vs electric heaters A common rule of thumb is that one square foot of your room needs 20 BTU/h of heating power.\nSo, let’s have a look at different room sizes and check whether propane heaters and electric heaters can heat them.\nFor this, I\u0026rsquo;ve assumed that an electric space heater produces 5,100 BTU/h of heat, whereas you can find propane heaters with up to 30,000 BTU/h of heating power.\n**Room size (in sq. ft.)****Can propane heaters heat it?****Can electric space heater heat it?**100 sq. ft.YesYes150 sq. ft.YesYes200 sq. ft.YesYes250 sq. ft.YesYes300 sq. ft.YesNo350 sq. ft.YesNo400 sq. ft.YesNo450 sq. ft.YesNo500 sq. ft.YesNo600 sq. ft.YesNo700 sq. ft.YesNo800 sq. ft.YesNo900 sq. ft.YesNo1000 sq. ft.YesNo1500 sq. ft.YesNo2000 sq. ft.NoNo3000 sq. ft.NoNo\nYes, the table above shows really large room sizes. Very few people have rooms 1000 sq. ft. and higher. But this gets the point across that you can find a propane heater for almost any common room size.\nHeating rooms over 300 sq. ft. with electric space heaters is possible. However, they won’t be able to get you comfortably warm.\nThat’s why propane heaters are much better suited for heating large spaces.\nPropane vs Electric space heater running cost comparison Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the running cost of propane and electric space heaters. Which one is cheaper?\nElectric space heaters Electric space heaters are expensive to run. A 1,500W space heater consumes 1,500Wh (or 1.5kWh) of energy per hour.\nWith an average electricity rate in the US of 14 cents per kWh, running an electric space heater for one hour costs 21 cents.\nHowever, due to inflation, these prices are rising quickly. The 14 cents per kWh are the latest official electricity rate. However, I suspect that running a space heater for one hour with the current prices can cost over 40 cents.\nIn the UK and Europe, it’s even worse. There a space heater hour is closer to 60 cents.\nPropane heater Running a propane heater is significantly cheaper than running an electric space heater. The cost of one million BTUs of heat energy from propane is $35.28.\nThis makes propane the second most cost-effective heat source after wood.\nMeanwhile, the same amount of heat generated with electricity costs $87.98.\nAccordingly, propane heat costs 60% less than electric heat.\nThat’s a significant advantage of heating using propane.\nPlease note that this calculation does not factor in the price of the propane tank or the cost to drive to a propane refill location.\nBut similarly, the cost of electricity does not factor in the price of installing wall outlets or building your home’s electric circuits in the first place.\nIt is a purely “ cost per heat”-based comparison. You could account for all the minute details, but the result would be the same: Propane is always cheaper than electricity.\nHow long does a propane heater last? So far, we’ve seen that propane heaters are both cheaper to run and hotter than electric space heaters.\nOne of the biggest disadvantages of propane heaters is, however, the energy source itself.\nYou will have to refill the propane.\nLet’s assume that you run a propane heater on 5,100 BTU per hour. This is the same amount of heat that a 1,500W electric space heater outputs.\nOn a 100lb propane tank (which contains a total of 1,727,520 BTU) you can run such a propane heater for roughly 339 hours. That’s more than 14 days continuously!\nUsually, you don’t run a propane heater continuously. Heating for 12 hours a day is more than enough.\nSo, you can run a propane heater for more than a month on a large 100lb tank.\nOf course, the bigger the tank size, the longer it will last.\nTo conclude this: Yes, it can be annoying to refill your propane heater.\nBut you won’t have to do get a refill too often. Propane gas contains a lot of heat energy. So, even a small tank will last you for a while. Especially, when it’s not your main heat source.\nIs electric heat safer than propane? Which is safer? Electric or propane heat? To answer this question, we have to distinguish between two types of common electric heaters.\nHere’s the quick answer:\nThe safest space heaters are electric oil-filled radiators. They don’t have exposed heating elements and only moderate surface temperatures. Oil-filled radiators are child and pet-safe.\nContrary, propane heaters and electric infrared heaters have exposed heating elements and can produce very hot temperatures.\nThe space right in front of propane and infrared heaters can get hot enough to burn plastic.\nIf your space heater has to be very safe, then propane is not an option for you. But also electric infrared heaters are not very safe.\nI’d say that as long as you use your heater reasonably, nothing can happen. I am running my infrared heater almost every day, and nothing ever happened.\nYou really have to challenge your fate and place sensitive objects right in front of your propane or infrared heater to risk a fire.\nAs long as no kids or pets are around, all space heaters are safe. But as soon as dumb people (throwing toothpicks into the heating elements) are around, no space heater is safe.\nSo, it’s all about proper and reasonable usage.\nTechnically, electric space heaters can be safer than propane heaters as they usually have a built-in thermostat that keeps the heater at moderate temperatures.\nWhen to use which heater? (Questions to help you decide) I’ve tried to lay out this article in a way that helps you make the decision!\nHere are some decision-guiding questions:\nDo you have access to electricity? If not, then get a propane heater. Else, continue with the next question.\nIs your living space larger than 300 square feet or do you need a strong heat source? If yes, then get a propane heater. Else, continue.\nDo you want to save money (even though you have to refill gas occasionally)? If yes, get a propane heater. Else, continue.\nDo you need a very safe space heater? If yes, get an electric oil-filled radiator. Else, get whichever propane or electric heater you prefer.\nRecommended products: Best propane and electric space heaters If you want to get an electric space heater, then I highly recommend getting this Pelonis oil-filled radiator (click to read my review).\nIf, on the other hand, you decide for a propane heater, then check out this favorite of mine: Mr. Heater Big Buddy propane heater (click to read my review).\nBoth are great heaters and will last you a long time!\nConclusion Propane heaters are great primary and independent heat sources. They output a lot of heat for just a fraction of the cost of electric heat.\nHowever, propane heaters need occasional tank refills and are not as safe as some electric space heaters (oil-filled radiators).\nIn general, if you already have a central heat source at home and you just want supplementary heat, then electric space heaters are fine.\nBut if you want to heat a space that has no heat source and maybe even poor insulation, then propane heaters are your best bet!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/propane-vs-electric-space-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eShould you get a propane heater or an electric heater?

A ventless propane heater, also known as the ‘ blue flame heater,’ is a type of space heater that uses propane fuel to heat a room without needing a chimney or other ventilation system. It uses propane and oxygen to generate heat.\nPropane is a highly efficient and clean burning fuel source, making it an ideal choice for indoor heating. Unlike traditional gas heaters, ventless propane heaters do not require an external vent or chimney to operate safely.\nThese heaters are typically installed in a room or area that does not have access to a chimney or other ventilation systems, such as a garage, RV, or basement.\nThey have two essential components: an indoor heater and an outdoor propane tank that work together to heat up a room and make it comfortable to sit in.\nHow Does a Ventless Propane Heater Work? A ventless propane heater works by burning propane gas while using oxygen (of the room it is inside) to produce heat energy.\nThis type of heater is typically used in areas where traditional heating methods are impractical or impossible. The ventless propane heater operates by burning the propane gas in a sealed chamber. This chamber is designed to prevent the release of any fumes into the room.\nAs the gas is burned, it produces heat which is then circulated through a fan system. This fan is designed to circulate warm air throughout the room.\nIn addition, the fan helps to evenly distribute the heat, ensuring that all areas of the room are heated evenly.\nThe ventless propane heater is designed to be 99.9% efficient and cost-effective. The heat produced by the heater is often much lower than that produced by traditional heating systems, meaning that you can save money on energy bills.\nAdditionally, the heater can be operated without the need for additional ventilation, allowing you to keep your home warm without needing to worry about additional ductwork or chimneys.\nThis makes the ventless propane heater an ideal choice for those areas where traditional heating systems are not feasible.\nWhat’s even better about ventless propane heaters is that they burn all of the gas, unlike wood or pellets that do not completely burn down, and you are left to deal with the ash and smoke. With them, you do not have to deal with the residue.\nIs a Ventless Propane Heater Safe? Ventless propane heaters are an increasingly popular choice for heating indoor spaces. They are safe to use if properly installed and maintained according to manufacturer instructions. The key safety considerations for ventless propane heaters are proper ventilation, installation, and maintenance.\nProper ventilation is essential, as the exhaust from the heater must be vented outside in order to prevent the build-up of dangerous carbon monoxide and other combustion gasses.\nProper installation is also important, as the heater must be installed according to the manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s instructions to ensure proper functioning and to prevent the risk of fire or explosion.\nLastly, regular maintenance is vital, as it will ensure the heater is working as efficiently and safely as possible.\nVentless propane heaters are safe when used correctly, but it is important to remember that these heaters pose a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning if not properly vented. It is, therefore, important to ensure that the heater is installed and maintained according to the manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s instructions.\nOne of the safety issues the ventless propane heater poses is that it depletes the oxygen from the room it is in, as it does not use oxygen from the outdoors.\nThis is a major safety concern because it brings down oxygen levels in a room during winter, and during this time, the room is already not ventilated to let air in.\nThe experts, therefore, recommend not running the heaters for more than a couple of hours because this can increase the levels of carbon monoxide in a room, and it can be hazardous to human health.\nCan You Use a Ventless Propane Heater Indoors? Ventless propane heaters should not be used indoors if there isn’t a good ventilation system in the room. They produce carbon monoxide, which is an odorless and colorless gas that can be dangerous if inhaled in large quantities. When used indoors, carbon monoxide can quickly accumulate to dangerous levels. Therefore, ventilation is key.\nAs mentioned above, a ventless propane heater takes up the oxygen of the room it is in to function properly, so it depletes the room of its natural oxygen. Along with that, it brings up the carbon monoxide levels of the room, making it hazardous to breathe in.\nUnless there is no proper ventilation system in the room, it is not safe to use a ventless propane heater inside a room. If there is sufficient ventilation in the room, then a ventless propane heater is safe for use.\nPros of Ventless Propane Heaters These are the pros of ventless propane heaters:\nCost-effective: Ventless propane heaters are typically more affordable than traditional heaters, which makes them budget-friendly. You don’t have to invest a fortune to buy them.\nEnergy-efficient: They are also typically more efficient and can provide more BTUs (British Thermal Units) of heat per hour than traditional heaters. They are almost 99.9% efficient as they throw all the heat they produce into the room they are installed. Along with that, they save up on electricity bills (400%), too.\nEasy installation: Ventless propane heaters are also very easy to install and can be moved around or stored away easily when not in use. They save up installation costs too, which is a huge bonus and another factor for their increased popularity.\nNo outside ventilation required: Ventless propane heaters do not require venting to the outside, unlike traditional heaters, which can increase the cost of installation and reduce room air quality.\nCons of Ventless Propane Heaters These are the cons of ventless propane heaters:\nSafety Risk: Ventless propane heaters can be dangerous when not used properly. Since they do not vent gasses outside, they can create an unsafe buildup of carbon monoxide and other harmful gasses within the home.\nBesides that, they deplete the oxygen in a room, which can cause breathing issues in people.\nHumidity: The gasses and moisture are recycled back into the space because the fireplace doesn\u0026rsquo;t produce smoke. This causes humidity issues in some homes, and such places can become a breeding ground for molds that pose a great threat to human health.\nUnpleasant Odor: Many users report a strong and offensive odor when using ventless propane heaters, and many homeowners do not like it.\nCost: Ventless propane heaters are usually more expensive than other propane heating options.\nDifficulty Lighting: Ventless propane heaters can be difficult to light and require frequent cleaning and maintenance.\nHow-to: Choose the Best Ventless Propane Heaters Now that we have covered the basics, let’s dig into the features that make ventless propane heaters stand out from the rest.\n#1 Size Choose a model that is designed for the size of your room. Make sure to check the maximum BTU rating for the heater and compare it to the size of your room. This will show you the maximum heating capacity of your heater and if it will be sufficient to warm up your space.\n#2 Installation Ventless propane heaters are designed to be wall-mounted or free-standing. Choose the type that best fits your space and make sure that you install it correctly.\n#3 Safety Features Look for safety features. Ventless propane heaters come with a variety of safety features, such as oxygen depletion sensors and automatic shut-off switches. Choose one with the features that best fit your needs.\n#4 Heating Efficiency Check for efficiency. To do that, look for heaters with an AFUE (annual fuel utilization efficiency) rating of at least 80%.\nThis will help ensure that you are getting the most efficient heating from your heater. If you decide to go for a higher BTU for the heater, the price will go higher.\nIdeally, you should aim for around 40 BTU per square foot. To get a more accurate size for your ventless propane heater, you can use a Heating BTU calculator.\n#5 Price Consider the cost. Ventless propane heaters can range from very cheap to quite expensive. Consider your budget and make sure to choose a heater that fits your needs and is within your budget.\n#6 Thermostat The thermostat feature helps the heater to automatically control the temperature. It allows you to program your home\u0026rsquo;s heating temperatures to match your schedule, lowering your overall energy bills.\nIf you want to save fuel, it may be best to purchase a propane heater with a thermostat setting (rather than a manual).\nFinal Thoughts This brings us to the end of the blog on ventless propane heaters, and we hope the detailed guide will help you make educated purchasing decisions.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re easy to install, efficient, and economical heating options which is what makes them an ideal choice for many homeowners.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-ventless-propane-heaters/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eChoosing the right heater for your home or office is a daunting process.

Can they be a fire hazard? In this article, I am going to tell you exactly how hot infrared heaters get, which materials they can ignite and whether they can start a fire on their own.\nAdditionally, I will tell you how to safely run an infrared heater. And we will check whether you really need an infrared heater (because there is a safer space heater type).\nQuick answer: Electric infrared heaters are safe to use indoors. Don’t place any objects right in front of the infrared heater, as infrared radiation in close proximity to the heater is hot enough to ignite plastic. So, use your infrared heater reasonably. If you can’t enforce reasonable usage because you have kids or pets at home, you should get an oil-filled radiator instead. They are safer than infrared heaters because they have much lower surface temperatures.\nRecommended safest infrared heater My recommended safest infrared heater is the Dr. Infrared Heater DR-968 (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt’s significantly safer than other infrared heaters because its case is made of real wood.\nNow, some of you might wonder… “Doesn’t wood burn?”. Yes, at some point all materials will ignite. The difference is the ignition temperature.\nMost plastic materials start melting around 250°F (120°C), whereas wood only ignites above 1100°F (600°C).\nInfrared heating elements get very hot (\u0026gt;750°F). So, using a case material with a high ignition temperature reduces the chance of self-ignition.\nWhich infrared heaters are safe indoors? In general, all electric infrared heaters are safe to use indoors. Usually, infrared heaters have similar standard safety features (overheat protection, tip-over protection, etc.).\nMore expensive models won’t get you more safety features.\nHowever, expensive models likely have better case materials. For example, there are no infrared heaters with wooden cases below the price point of a Dr. Infrared Heater.\nBy spending more, you get better materials.\nStill, even cheap infrared heaters are usually sufficiently safe. Of course, you have to consider the quality of your infrared heater when using it.\nI wouldn’t trust a $20 Walmart heater to keep my child’s bedroom warm overnight.\nWhich infrared heaters are dangerous indoors? Usually, when people refer to “infrared heaters”, they mean “electric infrared heaters”.\nHowever, the spectrum of infrared heaters is a bit broader than that. Aside from electric infrared heaters, there are also gas and fuel-based infrared heaters.\nSome of them are safe, such as the Mr. Heater Big Buddy (click to read my review). However, some of those gas-based heaters should only be used outdoors.\nUsually, when you are looking at a heater’s sales page, you’ll find the word “outdoor” when it is intended for outdoor use only.\nThe reason some of those gas and fuel-based heaters are not safe to use indoors is that there is a risk of carbon monoxide production.\nIf the heater is imperfectly adjusted, it can’t burn the gas or fuel ideally, which causes incomplete combustion.\nThis incomplete combustion produces toxic waste gases that you don’t want to have indoors.\nAnyways. I assume you are looking for an indoor-safe electric space heater.\nSo, let’s have a look at why indoor electric space heaters can be dangerous as well.\nWhat makes infrared heaters more dangerous than other space heaters? Infrared heaters are not the safest type of space heater!\nInfrared heaters differ significantly from other space heaters in one aspect. This aspect is both an advantage and a disadvantage. It’s this:\nInfrared heat distribution Infrared heaters radiate the heat in one direction. They don’t heat a room evenly. Instead, they heat the objects and people standing in front of them.\nInfrared heaters, therefore, have a directional heat distribution.\nDirectional heat distribution is good when you look at efficiency. Instead of heating the entire room evenly, infrared heaters heat only an area of the room.\nThis increases the perceived efficiency. Since the heat reaches you in a “bundled” ray package, it feels a lot warmer than if it is spread evenly.\nThe downside of the focused heat is, however, that the temperatures in front of an infrared heater are very high.\nI’ve done an experiment.\nI placed a styrofoam block at different distances in front of an infrared heater an measured the styrofoam block’s temperature using a laser thermometer.\nHere’s the result.\nThe temperature of an infrared heater at varying distances.\nAs you can see, infrared heaters get very hot in close proximity! My styrofoam block started smoking and melting as soon as I placed it closer than 5 inches to the infrared heater.\nI removed the styrofoam immediately.\nThe incredibly high temperatures in front of the heating elements make an infrared heater one of the unsafest electric indoor space heaters.\nExposed heating elements Another disadvantage of infrared heaters is their exposed heating elements.\nThe heating elements of infrared heaters always have to be open \u0026amp; visible. Otherwise, the radiation can’t easily escape the infrared heater.\nThe exposed heating elements go hand in hand with the heat distribution. They are what cause the high temperatures in close proximity to an infrared heater.\nThe heating elements are hot enough to cause pet fur to smoke. I’ve seen images of cats starting to smoke when laying in front of infrared heaters. The same would be true for dogs, birds, and other pets.\nAlso, kids can easily burn their fingers on the heating elements.\nNow, it’s usually not possible to touch the heating elements directly. There’s a thin metal security grid in front of the heating elements.\nBut as you know, metal conducts heat very well. Touching the grid would be the same as touching a hot frying pan.\nCan infrared heaters cause a fire? Infrared heaters can only start a fire if you place an object with a low ignition temperature (such as plastic or styrofoam) right in front of it at a distance of under 5 inches.\nWithin this radius, infrared radiation is still very focused. It can cause sensitive objects to heat up above their melting and ignition temperature.\nHowever, I can think of no scenario where any reasonable person would place an object immediately in front of a running infrared heater.\nAs long as you use your infrared heater reasonably, there is no risk of fire.\nWhich space heaters are safer than infrared heaters? Oil-filled radiators are a lot safer than infrared heaters. When you have pets or kids at home, it is no question that you should always choose an oil-filled radiator over an infrared heater.\nOil-filled radiators do not have any exposed heating elements. Instead, they have a large metal heating body.\nThis metal body contains oil and a heating element. The heating element heats the oil. And the oil carries the heat evenly to the large metal surface.\nThis even heat distribution ensures that the surface temperature of an oil-filled radiator does not exceed 170°F (80°C).\nNow, this is still hot to the touch. But it will neither hurt you nor will it cause a fire.\nAnd on top of that, oil-filled radiators distribute the heat evenly in all directions. They don’t focus the heat radiation as infrared heaters do.\nHere you have to keep in mind that an oil-filled radiator will heat your room to the same temperature as an infrared heater.\nThe amount of heat an oil-filled radiator releases matches the amount of heat that an infrared heater releases (1,500W for both).\nSo, your room will get equally warm with both heaters.\nPersonally, I prefer oil-filled radiators for whole-room heating, and I prefer infrared heaters when I want to focus heat toward me (for example toward my desk when I am working).\nHow to safely run an infrared heater So far we’ve seen that infrared heaters are not the safest type of space heaters. However, this doesn’t mean that they are dangerous.\nYou just have to use them correctly.\nFree up the space before your infrared heater The area right before an infrared heater can get very hot if you block it with an object. If you don’t place anything in front of your infrared heater, the heat radiation continues to spread and does not overheat anything.\nMake sure that the space before your infrared heater is free. Ideally, there should be no object blocking the infrared radiation between you and the infrared heater.\nThis way you don’t waste energy, no object in the way heats up, and you get the most of your infrared heater.\nRotate the infrared heater toward you Infrared heat is most efficient when it radiates directly at you. So, I recommend you place your infrared heater to face you directly.\nThis way you don’t waste energy, and, even more importantly, you notice when the heater settings are too high.\nSince infrared heaters bundle the radiation, you don’t really notice a heater overheating when it radiates the heat away from you.\nWhen you point your heater at you and notice it’s too warm, you can lower the settings, save energy and improve the safety and longevity of your infrared heater.\nWhich safety features do electric infrared heaters have? Infrared heaters have the same safety features that other space heaters also have.\nThey usually come with built-in overheat protection that automatically shuts off the heater when the internal temperature rises too high.\nAlso, many infrared heaters have a built-in thermostat that adapts the heating output to your room’s current temperature. If your room is already hot, the thermostat notices and reduces the heating.\nAnd infrared heaters usually have a built-in tip-over protection. Tip-over protection is a switch that automatically shuts off the heater when you tip it over or when it falls over.\nTip-over protection is arguably the most important safety feature in an infrared heater, because of the exposed heating elements.\nIn the worst case, your infrared heater tips over, and its hot heating elements touch the carpet and possibly cause a fire.\nIn this case, they have to shut off quickly. Ideally, before they even touch the ground.\nConclusion I feel like I made infrared heaters sound like very dangerous infrared heaters in this article.\nActually, I am using my infrared heater almost daily. And I never had any problems with it.\nYes, there was one time when a styrofoam block started smoking after I placed it in front of the infrared heater. However, that was in the context of an experiment. Never would I place anything right in front of my infrared heater.\nSo:\nAs long as you use your infrared heater reasonably, it is a perfectly safe space heater.\nInfrared heaters only become problematic when you block the area right in front of them.\nAvoid this and you are fine.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-infrared-heaters-safe-indoors/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre infrared heaters safe to use indoors?

The answer to this question depends on several factors, such as propane tank size, the heating capacity of the patio heater, propane burning efficiency, and the quantity of propane in the tank.\nSo, to help you better understand, I will look at all the factors and calculate how long your propane tank would last on your patio heater.\nQuick answer: An average patio heater (45,000 BTU/h) lasts 7 hours with a 20lb propane tank, 10 hours with a 30lb propane tank, and 13 hours with a 40lb propane tank. A propane tank’s running duration depends on its size, the heat capacity of the heater, and the burning efficiency of your patio heater. Patio heaters between 10,000 BTU/h and 50,000 BTU/h with a 20lb propane tank would last 30 hours to 6 hours.\nWithout further ado, I\u0026rsquo;ll take you to the calculations so that you may be able to understand the concept clearly.\nHow long does a propane tank last on a patio heater? You see, there are different sizes of propane tanks (lb) and patio heaters (BTU/h) available in the market.\nSo, we can\u0026rsquo;t just say how long your propane tank would last on your patio heater without knowing the tank size and your heater\u0026rsquo;s capacity (in BTU/h).\nGenerally, your propane tank would last longer if you use a large propane tank with a small patio heater (less BTU/h).\nSo, for your better understanding, I will calculate the time duration for different sizes of propane tanks and patio heaters.\nHow long does a 20lb propane tank last on a patio heater? I\u0026rsquo;m going to start with a 20lb propane tank as it\u0026rsquo;s the most commonly used tank size with outdoor patio heaters.\nTo calculate how long a propane tank lasts on a patio heater, you can use this formula:\nPropane tank\u0026rsquo;s effective energy (in BTU) / Patio heater\u0026rsquo;s capacity (in BTU/h)\nSo, if we have a propane tank\u0026rsquo;s effective energy and output heating capacity of a patio heater, we can easily calculate how long a propane tank would last on a patio heater.\nLet me calculate the propane tank\u0026rsquo;s effective energy for you.\nEffective energy of a 20lb propane tank One pound of propane contains 21,594 BTU of heat energy ( source)\nSo, a 20lb propane tank contains 431,880 BTU (20lb × 21,592 BTU per lb).\nBut, the propane patio heater\u0026rsquo;s burning efficiency is not 100%. Usually, it\u0026rsquo;s between 80%-95%. So, here I will assume that the efficiency is 85%.\nAlso, propane tanks are often only filled to 80% capacity, allowing the propane to expand safely.\nSo, considering 85% efficiency and 80% capacity, I\u0026rsquo;ve calculated the effective energy of a 20lb propane tank:\n431,880 BTU x 0.85 (heating efficiency) x 0.80 (tank fill percentage) = 293,678 BTU\nNow we have the effective energy that a 20lb propane tank provides. It\u0026rsquo;s time to check how long a propane tank lasts on different patio heaters.\nHow long does a 20lb propane tank last on different patio heaters? You can find different-sized patio heaters in the market. The sizes are described by their heating capacity (BTU/h).\nA small patio heater typically consumes 10,000 BTU/h, while a large one produces 50,000 BTU/h per hour. A heater with a high BTU capacity consumes propane faster, so the more BTUs it has, the faster it consumes.\nSo, I\u0026rsquo;m going to calculate how long does a 20lb propane tank last on different patio heaters (10,000 BTU/h - 50,000 BTU/h) with this formula:\nRunning duration = Propane tank\u0026rsquo;s effective energy / Patio heater\u0026rsquo;s capacity (BTU/h)\n**Patio heater heating capacity (in BTU/h)****Heating capacity of a 20lb propane tank (in hours)**10,000 BTU/h29.36 hours15,000 BTU/h19.57 hours20,000 BTU/h14.68 hours25,000 BTU/h11.74 hours30,000 BTU/h9.78 hours35,000 BTU/h8.39 hours40,000 BTU/h7.34 hours45,000 BTU/h6.52 hours50,000 BTU/h5.87 hours\nSo, a 20lb propane tank would last 29.36 hours on a 10,000 BTU/h patio heater and 5.87 hours on a 50,000 BTU/h patio heater.\nThese hours may vary depending on the usage of propane gas. Your heater may consume more propane than usual if the temperature around it is high or if there are leaks.\nHow long do different tank sizes last for an average patio heater? Now, I\u0026rsquo;m going to calculate how long propane tanks of different sizes would last on a 45,000 BTU/h (average patio heater)\nThe most commonly used propane tank sizes are 20lb, 30lb, 33 lb, 40lb, 100lb, 420lb, 330lb, 500lb, and 100lb. ( source)\nRelated: How long does a 100lb propane tank last?\nIf I have the effective energy of each propane tank, I can easily calculate how long it will last on a 45,000 BTU/h patio heater.\n**Propane tank size****Effective energy of propane tanks (in BTU)****Heating capacity of the tank (in hours)**20lb293,678 BTU6.52 hours30lb440,476 BTU 9.78 hours33lb484,524 BTU10.76 hours40lb587,302 BTU13.05 hours100lb1468,256 BTU32.62 hours420lb6166,675 BTU137.03 hours330 gallon2053,30,48 BTU456.28 hours500 gallon3111,06,80 BTU691.3 hours1000 gallon6222,13,60 BTU1382.69 hours\nNow, you can easily choose the propane tank size with your 45,000 BTU/h patio heater according to your requirements.\nConclusion A large-sized propane tank usually lasts longer than a small one. But that\u0026rsquo;s not it.\nTo determine how long your propane tank will last on your patio heater, you must know your tank size, output capacity (BTU/h), and the burning efficiency of your patio heater.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve calculated the time for different propane tanks and patio heaters and created tables for your better understanding.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve assumed a burning efficiency to be 85% (usually, the burning efficiency of patio heaters is 80%-95%)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-long-does-a-propane-tank-last-on-a-patio-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow long does a propane tank last on a patio heater?

In this article, I am going to guide you through different possible causes. For each cause, you’re going to learn how to test and fix it!\nWhen you are looking for a solution on Dyson’s official website, all you’re getting is this text\n“Issue not resolved, please speak to our Customer Support Team”.\nDyson - expressing love for their customers\nBut I bet you don’t want to spend your day waiting for some uninterested call center employee at Dyson to pick up the phone.\nI want to help you!\nAfter reading this article, you’ll know exactly what to look for and how to resolve your problem.\nQuick answer: You can fix a Dyson heater not turning on by making sure the wall outlet and power cord are working. Then clean all the airways (air inlet holes, air filter, internal components). Clogged airways might cause the overheat protection to trigger. If this still doesn’t help, inspect the internal power electronics and see if any part blew up or broke.\nLet’s have a look at each possible reason in order, with the likeliest first.\nReasons and fixes for a Dyson heater not turning on Normally, Dyson heaters are quality products that last for many years, if not even a decade (given that you take care of them).\nThat’s why we are first going to inspect everything outside the Dyson heater. Maybe the power source is the problem.\nPowerless wall outlet It could be that your wall outlet does not provide power and is switched off. There could be many reasons, but the likeliest is an overload in your home’s electric circuit.\nAnd it could even be that your Dyson heater caused the overload.\nThis problem is usually present in US-based homes since in the US the electric grids can’t handle as much power as electric grids in the UK or in Europe can. US homes run on 120V, while UK and European homes run on 230V.\nHow to test: Unplug your Dyson heater and plug any other electric device into the same outlet your Dyson heater was using before.\nDoes the device turn on? For example, if you plug in your phone charger, do you get a “charging” sign on your phone?\nIf the device does not turn on, you found the issue!\nHow to fix: Locate your electric service panel and inspect all of the switches (circuit breakers) and fuses. Does any of them look out of place? Is any of the switches turned off? Switch the circuit breaker back on and try turning on your Dyson heater.\nIf all of the switches look normal and you have a fuse box in your electric service panel, then check all of the fuses. Did any of the fuses blow?\nIf yes, then replace the fuse with an identical one. You can find them in online stores or in a local hardware store. After replacing the fuse, try running your Dyson heater!\nExtension cord broken Extension cords are usually cheap and, therefore, very error-prone. If you are running your Dyson Hot + Cool through an extension cord, your extension cord could be the point of failure.\nHow to test: Connect your Dyson heater to a wall outlet without the extension cord. Does it turn on now?\nHow to fix: You can trash the old extension cord. Repairing extension cords is neither safe nor worth it. A cheap extension cord will break again after a short time.\nFor space heaters, you should always get a heavy-duty extension cord. They last a lot longer, are thicker and can carry a lot higher currents.\nSo, get a new, proper extension cord and use it with your Dyson heater. It’s well worth the higher cost.\nClogged airways So far we have talked about possible reasons for your Dyson heater not turning on entirely. Clogged airways would allow your Dyson heater to turn on (i.e. you can see the thermostat display lighting up). But your Dyson heater won’t blow any air with blocked airways. Maybe even the fan won’t turn.\nHow to check: Dyson heaters have three different components that need to be free of any blockages.\nair inlet holes internal components air filter Most people only think about the air filter. So, let’s have a look at all airways.\nAir inlet holes The air inlet holes are located around the bottom part of your Dyson heater’s case.\nThey are the holes that allow air to flow into your Dyson heater. When they are blocked, the built-in fan can hardly draw any air into the device. It might not even turn on.\nHow to test: You can either open the case of your Dyson heater and remove the bottom part (as you would do when changing the air filter). Or you can just have a look at the air inlet holes from outside.\nDoes dirt block the holes?\nHow to fix: Poke the dirt with a toothpick. You can also use a dry toothbrush and brush over the holes.\nInternal components Between the air filter and fan sit the internal components. This includes the power electronics, the thermostat, and everything your heater needs to run.\nHow to test: Open your heater’s case until you can see the internal electronics. This is a little different for most Dyson Hot + Cool heaters, so I can’t describe a one-suits-all process here.\nCheck if there is dust inside your heater.\nHow to fix: Remove the dust. Since a lot of dust can accumulate inside the case, I recommend using a compressed air gun or a strong vacuum cleaner to get rid of most of the dust.\nAfter that, you can clean the details with a dry toothbrush.\nDon’t use water or any kind of cleaner to remove the dirt. This could damage the electronics and it will cause your heater to stink forever. Dust and bacteria love water.\nI wet-cleaned a device once and will never do it again.\nAir filter You should exchange your air filter every 12 months. When you skip changing your air filters, it might obstruct the fan and your heater will overheat which will trigger the overheat protection.\nSo, even dirty air filters can be a reason for a Dyson heater not turning on.\nHow to test: Usually, exchanging air filters is very simple. Open the sides of the bottom part of your Dyson heater. Again, the exact process to remove the air filters varies a little model by model.\nAfter opening the sides, you should be able to see whether your air filters are clogged or not.\nHow to fix: Replace the air filters with new ones that fit your model.\nAlternatively, you can do a quick test and try to run your Dyson heater without air filters. This officially voids the warranty. But you are trying to repair your Dyson heater yourself anyways.\nDoes your Dyson heater turn on again after unclogging all the airways? If not, let’s continue.\nDyson heater needs “hard reset” Just for the sake of completeness, I include this tip from Dyson’s official troubleshooting website.\nBut I highly doubt this one will make a difference.\nIn fact, the reason I am even writing this article is that Dyson’s official website is so useless.\nAnyways: Dyson heaters seem to hard reset themselves after 10 seconds of unplugging.\nHow to test: Unplug your Dyson heater for 10 seconds. Plug it back in after the waiting time is over. Does it turn on now?\nHow to fix: Your Dyson heater could potentially turn now. It has fixed itself.\nYou might be able to see why I think this tip is not the most helpful… Thanks, Dyson.\nPower cord broken The power cord that connects your Dyson heater to the wall outlet could be broken. This can happen when you frequently move your Dyson heater around.\nAnd it can happen when you plug in the Dyson heater behind furniture and the furniture presses against the wall plug and bends it.\nAnyways, there are many reasons. Let’s see if we can test this.\nHow to test: Testing a broken power cord is not straightforward. To test your heater’s power cord properly, you will need a multimeter.\nOpen the heater’s case until you can see the location where the power cord connects to the internal electronic circuitry.\nNow, be careful! Connect your Dyson Hot + Cool to a (working) wall outlet and carefully measure the voltage of the onboard electronics of your heater. The input voltage of the power module should be 120V in the US or 230V in the UK or Europe.\nIf you can’t measure a voltage anywhere, then your power cord is broken.\nHow to fix: You have to be familiar with power electronics and soldering to replace your broken power cord.\nYou can buy a replacement power cord anywhere online (it’s a regular power cord for any other device). Then, unsolder the existing power cord from the Dyson heater’s power module and solder the new power cord where the broken power cord was connected before.\nTry running your Dyson heater now. It should work!\nIf you are not familiar with electronics, you can have an electrician or a handyman family member check this cause for you.\nPower module broken Another potential cause for your Dyson heater not working is that the electronic power module is broken.\nThis one is a little harder to fix since it requires good electronic knowledge.\nHow to test: Open your Dyson heater’s case. Inspect the power module. Are there any broken resistors or blown capacitors? Is there a blown fuse? Does a part look burned?\nI think this visual inspection should detect most electronic issues. If you can’t see anything suspicious, then you can inspect the component with a multimeter.\nHow to fix: Locate the broken electronic part. Likely, you will have to use a soldering iron tto remove it. One exception are fuses which you can sometimes, but not always, pop out with your hands.\nReplace the broken part with a matching part. You can buy matching parts online or in an electronic hardware store.\nYour Dyson Hot + Cool is still not turning on? If after following the steps above your Dyson heater is still not turning on, then the fault is likely harder to detect.\nHere’s what I suggest you do.\nDon’t throw away the heater.\nSell it online instead. There are plenty of electronic hobbyists that buy, repair, and flip Dyson heaters that will buy your broken device.\nThen, use that money to get a new Dyson heater, such as this Dyson Hot + Cool(click here to view it on amazon).\nThis way, you get rid of your problem and you make someone else and yourself happy!\nIt’s a win-win situation for everybody.\nConclusion Usually, you can fix a Dyson heater not turning on by checking external causes such as the power supply chain (wall outlet, extension cord, power cord).\nIf this doesn’t work you should clean your Dyson heater’s airways thoroughly.

Is it safe to run a Dyson heater overnight?\nIn this article, we’re going to inspect everything we need to find out how long a Dyson heater can truly safely operate.\nWe’re going to check\nthe design of a Dyson heater and where the heat accumulates how hot Dyson heaters get how much power Dyson heaters draw and whether that can overload circuits whether Dyson heaters can melt And in the end, we’re going to conclude with what you can do to prepare your Dyson for long heating sessions!\nQuick answer: You can run a Dyson heater 24/7 in insulated living spaces such as your bedroom, living room, or kitchen. Dyson heaters don’t accumulate heat and, therefore, don’t overheat when you run them for a long time. And additionally, they have built-in overheat protection. Also, the air coming out of a Dyson heater is not hot enough to ignite any common household materials. You shouldn’t run a Dyson heater in an uninsulated space such as a garage or RV since then it will run on full power which could overheat the electric circuit.\nWill Dyson heaters overheat during long heating sessions? In general, Dyson heaters, such as this Dyson Hot + Cool (click here to view it on amazon), do not overheat during long heating sessions. Here’s why.\nHow a Dyson heater\u0026rsquo;s design increases safe running time A Dyson heater contains two heating elements. One sits on either side of the heater and is responsible for heating the air coming out of its respective side of the loop amplifier.\nTo carry the heat out of the loop amplifier the fan sitting inside the heater’s case constantly has to blow air over the heating elements.\nThe \u0026ldquo;loop amplifier\u0026rdquo; is the big circular air vent on top of a Dyson heater\nThis ensures that the heating elements do not overheat. It’s like a constant cooling breeze is drawing over the heating elements.\nIt could, however, be that a Dyson heater’s heating elements overheat on very low fan settings.\nIn this case, the airflow to carry the heat away from the heating elements is too weak.\nI assume that Dyson implemented a safety mechanism to reduce the heating on very low fan settings. So, that’s something you don’t need to worry about too much.\nHow hot do Dyson heaters get? You can set a Dyson heater’s thermostat to a maximum temperature of 99°F or 37°C.\nThis is, however, not necessarily the temperature of the air coming out of the bladeless fan.\nThe temperature you set on the thermostat is the target temperature you want your room to be.\nTo reach this temperature, your Dyson heater has to output air that\u0026rsquo;s hotter than the target temperature. Otherwise, it would be physically impossible to reach the target temperature (unless your room is an ideally insulated space, which it isn’t).\nSo, the target temperature you set is the minimum temperature of the air leaving it.\nBut how hot is it?\nElectric heating elements usually get up to 750°F to 850°F (around 400°C to 450°C) hot. This means the temperature of the air leaving the Dyson heater must be between 99°F and 850°F (between 37°C and 450°C).\nSince the air distributes within the Dyson heater’s loop amplifier (which is usually a comparably large space) and knowing that Dyson heaters do not get hot to the touch, I’d estimate the temperature to be around 140°F (60°C).\nSo, to summarize:\nThe heating elements inside a Dyson heater get up to 850°F (450°C) on full power. But the internal fan distributes the heat quickly so that the air leaving a Dyson heater is usually below 140°F (60°C).\nCan a Dyson heater ignite anything? Can anything ignite from a Dyson heater when running it for a long time?\nWell, the air leaving a Dyson heater, even if you run it for many hours, does not get hotter. It’s always going to be below 140°F.\nThat’s not enough to ignite anything… Or is it?\nHere’s a table of materials with low ignition temperatures. I’ve only included materials with an ignition temperature below 200°F (93°C):\n**Material****Ignition Temperature (in °F)**Triethylborane-4°FSilane70°FPhosphorous - White93°FPhosphorous - Transparent120°F\nTriethylborane (whatever that is, I am not a chemist) ignites below room temperature. So, that’s nothing you have to worry about.\nSilanes are compounds of silicon. If you don’t know what that is, you probably don’t have it at home (standing before your Dyson heater) anyways.\nAnd the same is true for Phosphorus.\nTo conclude:\nA Dyson heater does not get hot enough to burn any common materials (such as wood, plastic, or metal). So, Dyson heaters can’t cause ignition of any materials standing in front of them, even if the heater runs for a long time.\nAt what temperature does a Dyson case melt? Dyson heater cases are made of ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), which can withstand temperatures up to 80°C (176°F).\nThat’s the temperature at which the ABS material would lose its most important characteristics, including its such as high impact resistance.\nABS is “amorphous”, meaning the atoms don’t sit in a fixed structure (such as in crystals) it has no true chemical melting point. Instead, it melts slowly with increasing temperature.\nHowever, ABS will definitely melt at 230°C (446°F).\nSo, can the ABS material of a Dyson case melt?\nNo, because the heating elements don’t touch the case directly. Instead, the heating elements have plenty of air surrounding them. And additionally, the fan carries away the heat.\nA Dyson heater won\u0026rsquo;t melt over long running periods.\nWhat stops a Dyson heater from overheating? It’s not only the design, the material, and the built-in fan that makes a Dyson heater so safe.\nDyson heaters also have the following safety features:\nTip-over protection The tip-over protection automatically shuts off the heating when the Dyson heater tips over.\nSo, it’s impossible that, for example, a pet tips over the heater and causes a fire while you sleep.\nThe tip-over protection also shuts the heater off automatically when it’s tilted. So, it doesn’t even have to fall over completely.\nOverheat protection The overheat protection in a Dyson heater automatically shuts off the heating when the heater overheats.\nThat’s great, because, as we’ve seen earlier, the heating elements can theoretically get hot enough to melt the case.\nThe overheat protection prevents that.\nThermostat The built-in thermostat constantly monitors the temperature and controls the heat output.\nThe thermostat ensures that your Dyson heater never overheats your room, or any objects in your room, such as the carpet or curtains.\nCan a Dyson heater overheat your home’s electric circuit? Dyson heaters can draw up to 2,000W of power. That’s a lot!\nRegular space heaters only draw up to 1,500W. For a reason. Here’s why:\nElectric grids in the US and in Europe can handle different amounts of power. US-based electric circuits are a lot more sensitive.\nThe reason is that US home circuits are low voltage. They use 120V and 15A circuits, which limits the power usage to 120V × 15A = 1,800W.\nNow, some US homes can handle up to 20A of current which would allow for a power consumption of 120V × 20A = 2,400W.\nSo, the former 15A circuit, can’t handle a Dyson heater’s peak power at 2,000W.\nIn Europe and in the UK, all circuits can handle any heater, as they use 230V, and can, therefore, support twice the power (up to 4,800W).\nSo, the answer is:\nYes, a Dyson heater can theoretically overheat a US home’s electric circuit. However, Dyson heaters only draw the full peak power of 2,000W in very cold rooms, such as uninsulated cabins or garages.\nAlso, your circuit breaker will trip or a fuse will blow before anything overheats.\nDyson heaters are always safe to use in insulated spaces where they don’t have to run on maximum power.\nHow long can you run a Dyson heater? Let’s recap everything we’ve learned:\nDyson heaters are designed in a way that heat is quickly carried out of the case The air coming out of a Dyson heater is hot, but not hot enough to ignite anything The case of a Dyson heater will never melt unless the fan breaks and the overheat protection fail at the same time Dyson heaters won’t overheat your home’s electric circuit unless you run it in a very cold and uninsulated space (which would cause the heater to run at maximum power) Based on these findings, we can conclude:\nYou can run a Dyson heater 24/7 in your living space. The safety mechanisms of Dyson heaters prevent damage from long running durations. Also, Dyson heaters don’t trap heat, which makes heat accumulation impossible.\nBecause of the built-in thermostat and overheat protection a Dyson heater is able to figure out on its own when to stop heating.\nYou don’t have to worry about it.\nCan you leave your Dyson heater on all night? Yes, you can leave your Dyson heater on all night. A Dyson heater won’t overheat unless you block the amplifier loop (where the hot air leaves) with curtains or your blanket. So, place it at a safe distance.\nYou can even place a Dyson heater on the carpet in your bedroom. Carpets never ignite at the low temperatures coming out of a Dyson heater. And additionally, Dyson heaters vent their heat at the top, so they carry heat away from the carpet.\nHow to increase Dyson heater running durations If you are still worried about running your Dyson heater for long periods, or overnight, then here are some more tips for you.\nHere’s how to improve the safety of your Dyson heater during long running sessions:\nUse higher fan settings The built-in fan blows air over the heating elements. Accordingly, the higher the fan settings are, the lower the heating elements’ temperature is.\nThis reduces the risk of overheating and also reduces the temperature of your heating elements when they run for a long time.\nDon’t use a Dyson heater in cold and uninsulated spaces Dyson heaters are not safe to use in very cold spaces such as uninsulated garages or RVs during wintertime.\nThe reason is that the cold temperature in combination with the lack of insulation causes the heater to run on peak power consumption continuously.\nOn 15A circuits in the US, this is a problem and can cause fuses to blow or circuit breakers to trip.\nOr even worse, if there is no proper safety mechanism, then the circuit will overheat.\nInstead, use your Dyson heater only in well-insulated living spaces, such as your bedroom or your living room.\nSet moderate temperatures Set only moderate heating settings. This directly affects the temperature of your heater’s heating elements as well as the Dyson heater’s power consumption.\nBy lowering the power consumption, you reduce the risk of overheating your electric circuit. And you reduce the temperature of the air leaving the Dyson heater.\nSo, it’s even safer to run 24/7.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-long-can-you-run-a-dyson-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow long can a Dyson heater run without interruption?

The usual cause for this is blocked airways, issues with the thermostat, or a broken part in the electronic circuitry.\nIn this article, you will find each of the most common causes as well as instructions on how to inspect and test and fix the respective cause.\nQuick answer: Your Dyson heater usually does not blow hot air if the airways are blocked with dust, dirt, and moisture. You can fix this by dry-brushing the internal parts using a toothbrush. Also, clean all of the air inlet holes in the case of the heater. Set your thermostat properly. And inspect the electronic circuitry if it still does not work.\nLet’s have a look at each of these steps and finally fix your Dyson heater!\nHow to fix your Dyson Heater not blowing hot air The number one reason for a Dyson heater not blowing hot air is that its airways are clogged.\nDysons accumulate dust, moisture, and oil over time. When you use your Dyson heater for a long time, it’s very likely that the accumulated dirt mix blocks the air and prevents proper heating.\nDyson heaters accumulate dust in the following areas:\nOn the air filter Inside the case where the electronics and the fan sit In the “loop amplifier”. That’s the big circular fan slit on top of your Dyson heater. If you clean these thoroughly and take your time, then I’d say the chance is 95% your Dyson heater will blow hot air again.\nLet’s have a look at each of those dust-accumulating spots:\nClean clogged internal parts Over time, the internal parts located inside the case of your Dyson heater will get dusty.\nHow to test: Open the bottom part of your Dyson Hot + Cool heater. To do that you can turn your Dyson heater upside down (with the bottom control panel now facing upwards).\nThen push back the control panel (yes, it moves) and you will see a few screws which you have to unscrew.\nThen push the control panel in the other direction and you will find more screws to unscrew on the other side. Remove those.\nAfter removing all of the screws, you can lift off the bottom part of your Dyson heater and you should be able to look inside it.\nAre your internals dusty and dirty? If yes, then that’s one major cause of your Dyson heater not working.\nHow to fix: Ensure your Dyson heater is unplugged from the wall outlet. Use either a strong vacuum cleaner or a compressed air gun to remove the dust.\nBe careful not to bump the vacuum cleaner into the electronics as this could break off soldered parts.\nWith a compressed air gun, you can just blow all of the dust out of your Dyson heater. Just make sure you don’t hold it too close to any electronic circuitry that you could damage.\nAlternatively, if you don’t have a good vacuum cleaner or a compressed air gun, just dry brush the internals using a toothbrush.\nThis will take a bit longer, but the result will be the same.\nDusty internal components in a Dyson Hot + Cool blocking the airflow\nNow that the internal parts are clean and dusted, let’s continue with the next step.\nClean air inlet holes around the case All Dyson heaters have air inlet holes around the bottom part. These air inlet holes have to be open for the fan to be able to draw air into the airways.\nIf your Dyson heater’s air inlet holes are blocked, your fan is not able to blow any air.\nThe air inlet holes are especially prone to accumulate dirt since they sit in front of the air filter and the air passing through the holes is not filtered yet.\nHow to test: You should open your Dyson heater’s case (as described in the previous section).\nYou can then hold your Dyson heater against a light source (lamp or window) and see if the holes are open or blocked.\nThe holes are open if light passes through them. They are blocked if you can only see black, or reduced light.\nHow to fix: If your heater’s air inlet holes are dirty, you will have to clean them from the outside and the inside of your case.\nHere’s one important note:\nI see everyone online recommending to clean your Dyson heater’s case using kitchen cleaner or water.\nHowever, I recommend you try to dry- clean the air inlet holes first. The reason is that wet cleaning will moisturize the dirt and increase mold growth.\nI did this one time and my device started stinking so much that I could not use it anymore.\nSo, you can use a dry toothbrush to clean the air inlet holes.\nYou can poke through the holes with a toothpick and loosen any hardened dirt.\nAlso, you can try to blow out any dirt with your compressed air gun (if you have one).\nNow that the internals and the air inlet holes are done, try to run your Dyson heater and see if it is blowing hot air now. It is very likely that you already fixed your problem!\nIf it’s still not working, let’s continue:\nClean the clogged loop amplifier The loop amplifier is the large circular slit sitting on top of your Dyson heater. It’s the part where the air comes out.\nDyson got really fancy here. The “amplifier” is just a large slit through which the fan presses the air.\nAccording to Bernoulli’s principle the air’s velocity increases, while its cross-section of the air decreases. So, the amount (volume per time unit) of air that blows into your room is constant and does not even change…\nAnyways, because Dyson heaters press air through this thin slit, they are very dust-sensitive. Even a little dust inside the loop amplifier will harm the airflow significantly.\nHow to test: You can run your Dyson heater in cooling mode and see whether air blows out the loop amplifier evenly. Or is there any part of the loop amplifier that blows more air than another part?\nIdeally, air should evenly leave your Dyson heater.\nYou can also unmount the loop amplifier and turn your Dyson heater on. Listen and feel how much air the fan blows. Then mount the loop amplifier again and compare whether anything changes.\nDoes the fan sound any different now? Does it still blow the same amount of air? If the airflow changes after mounting the loop amplifier, the airways inside the loop amplifier are likely blocked.\nHow to fix: Unmount the loop amplifier and dry brush the slit. Brush a toothbrush along the opening of the loop amplifier.\nMount the loop amplifier again and start your Dyson heater. Does the airflow improve?\nReplace or remove the air filter All air in a Dyson heater passes through the air filter. Your heater’s air filter is another spot where dirt and dust accumulate and block proper airflow.\nIdeally, you should replace your air filters every 12 months (at least, according to Dyson). If you don’t do that, or you were not even aware of that, then obstructed air filters are a likely problem.\nHow to test: Open your Dyson heater and remove the air filters. You can check your manual for how to do it with your specific heater model. Every model is slightly different.\nUsually, it’s a simple lifting of the loop amplifier and then just removing the case parts with the air inlet holes. Then, you can directly access the air filters.\nHow to fix: If your air filters are clogged you can do three different things. All of them will improve the airflow, but only one is a solution Dyson likes:\nReplace the air filter Clean the air filter Remove the air filter Guess which one Dyson prefers? Right, the first one.\nReplacing the air filters is usually the best option since it fixes your airflow problem and it improves the air quality.\nHowever, if you are short on cash or you want to fix your Dyson heater now, you can just dry-brush the excess dirt using a toothbrush. This will not get rid of all the fine dust particles.\nBut it might be enough to unclog your heater for proper airflow again.\nThe third option is to remove the air filter entirely. Now, this is highly discouraged by Dyson as it voids your warranty. Dyson claims that this can damage your heater’s internals.\nBut I think removing the air filters is just fine for a quick check of whether the air filter is your problem or not.\nIf your Dyson heater blows hot air when running it without a filter, you can tell for sure that the air filter is the cause of the problem.\nThat’s it. The airway-cleaning tips we just covered will get 95% of Dyson heaters working again. Make sure you follow them closely and I am sure your Dyson heater will work just fine.\nIf your heater still does not blow hot air, here’s what else you should check.\nSet a target temperature above room temperature Dyson heaters have a built-in thermostat. On the front panel of your Dyson heater, you can set the target temperature of your room. That’s the temperature you want your room to be.\nThe target temperature is not the temperature of the air coming out of your heater. That’s a common misconception.\nIf the target temperature is below room temperature, the heater won’t turn on.\nHow to test: Set your Dyson heater to the highest setting (99°F / 37°C) and see if it heats.\nIf your Dyson heater starts heating now, but not at your desired target temperature, this simply means that the target temperature is likely below the current room temperature.\nHow to fix: There’s no fix for this. If you want your Dyson heater to blow hot air, increase the target temperature setting on the front panel.\nIt should be working then.\nWait for the Dyson heater to heat up After turning on your Dyson heater, it does not immediately blow how air. Most Dyson heaters need around 1 minute to start the heating after turning on.\nAnd additionally, the heating elements which are located on either side of the loop amplifier turn on one at a time. This causes the heater to blow hot air on one side of the loop amplifier before the other side starts getting warm.\nI have no idea what the technical reason for this might be. It might have something to do with the control algorithm of the thermostat. Or it could reduce tension in the plastic case from sudden heating.\nHow to test: Run your Dyson heater for more than a minute. Does it get warm now?\nHow to fix: Unfortunately, there is no fix for this. Dyson heaters (and almost all other kinds of heaters) need time to heat up.\nYou just need to be more patient.\nFix blown or broken parts in the electronic circuitry It could also be that your Dyson heater has an internal electronic issue. It could be that the power module does not deliver enough power to run the heating elements.\nOr it could be that the thermostat’s thermometer is broken and returns wrong values to the thermostat (which causes it to think that your room is already at target temperature and needs no heating).\nHow to test: This one is a little advanced, but it should be doable for everyone who likes to repair electronics.\nOpen the Dyson heater’s case until you see the electronic circuitry. I find the simplest way to inspect electronics is to just look at all the parts.\nUse a flashlight and a magnifying glass to check all of the small resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits.\nAre there burn marks around any of the parts? Is a connection of any part broken? Is a component hovering a tenth of a millimeter above a connection without actually touching it? (Yes, I’ve seen all of these things).\nIf you find something, note the part number (if there is any), or try to find online what part it is.\nHow to fix: Get a replacement part. Replace the broken part with your replacement. Likely, you will have to use a soldering iron. Use plenty of flux to make a good connection.\nRun your Dyson heater and see if it starts blowing hot air now.\nIf you find an issue and you know which part is broken, but you can’t properly fix it yourself, you can ask an electrician (or maybe a family member who knows how to solder) to do it for you.\nWhat to do if your Dyson heater is still not heating? If you follow all of the above steps your Dyson heater should be heating.\nBut if yours still does not, I’d recommend just getting a new heater. My personal recommendation would be this Dyson Hot + Coo l (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis one is a perfectly good 1,500W Dyson heater.\nThere’s just one more thing I have to say before you splurge on another Dyson product.\nGet a Dyson only if you really enjoyed your current model. Similar to Apple products, Dyson is a brand that values design, quality, and user experience a lot.\nBut you have to pay a high price for that.\nSo, only get a Dyson heater if it’s truly worth it for you.\nDesign, quality, and user experience are perfectly valid buying justifications. Just like many people prefer luxury cars over cheaper cars with the same horsepower.\nIf, however, you only need a heat source, and you don’t really care about the design of the heater, then you should get a regular oil-filled radiator, such as this Pelonis oil-filled radiator (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis oil-filled radiator produces the exact same amount of heat as the Dyson Hot + Cool, but it’s a lot cheaper.\nIt’s my personal favorite electric heater, so I am a bit biased. Here’s my review.\nDyson claims that their heaters are more efficient than conventional space heaters. But that is factually not the case. I’ve written an extensive article about why Dyson heaters can’t be more efficient than other space heaters.\nCheck this one out! It will improve your understanding of Dyson’s marketing claims and whether they can withstand fact-checks.\nConclusion You can fix almost any Dyson heater not blowing hot air by cleaning clogged airways. Dust, dirt, and moisture are the most common cause of air not being able to move inside your heater.\nI’d say if you follow this article closely, you are guaranteed to find a fix for your problem!\nEven if you decide to buy a new Dyson heater in the end, you always know which issues to look out for.\nNow you know that you have to maintain Dyson’s airways frequently. When your heater’s airways are blocked, you can quickly check and fix it!\nI hope I could help you resolve your problem.

In this article, we’re going to have a quick check!\nQuick answer: No, you never need to vent an electric infrared heater. Electric infrared heaters don’t burn fuel or gas. Therefore, they emit no waste gases or water vapor. Only fuel or gas-based heaters need venting. However, you can run a portable propane infrared heater without venting for a few hours. You will only have to vent your room occasionally. Other gas or fuel-based heaters need a fixed vent installation.\nLet’s have a look at different types of infrared heaters and whether they need venting.\nAt the end of this article, I am going to recommend you my two favorite ventless infrared heaters.\nOne is an electric infrared heater, the other is a propane-based heater.\nWhich infrared heaters need venting? (Electric, gas, fuel-based) There’s a very common misconception among people. To answer why you don’t have to vent infrared heaters, we first have to clarify what they are.\nWhat’s the common understanding of an infrared heater? Actually, every heater is an infrared heater, since infrared radiation is heat radiation. For heat to reach you, all space heaters have to emit infrared radiation.\n( Otherwise, you would not perceive your heater as hot )\nThis means that also gas and fuel-based space heaters are technically infrared heaters.\nHowever, the general public does not refer to gas- and fuel-based space heaters as infrared heaters.\nAnd here’s the misconception:\nThe technically correct understanding of an infrared heater would be any heater that emits heat radiation. This would include gas- and fuel-based heaters.\nBut when people talk about infrared heaters, or when you are about to buy an “infrared heater”, it’s always an electric infrared heater.\nAnd this is what causes the question “Do infrared heaters need to be vented?” to be a little tricky.\nIt is technically the wrong question to ask. Instead, we have to ask the more precise following questions:\nDo electric infrared heaters have to be vented? Do fuel- or gas-burning infrared heaters have to be vented? We have to differentiate within the group of “infrared heaters”.\nLet’s have a look:\nDo electric infrared heaters have to be vented? No, electric infrared heaters never need venting. Electric infrared heaters convert electricity to infrared radiation.\nNo fuel or gas burning is involved, which means there is no ongoing chemical reaction in an electric infrared heater.\nInfrared heaters work simply by running a large current through their heating element. The heating element is just a simple electric resistor.\nThe only difference is that it is a solid and large resistor, usually made of thick wire, carbon, or ceramic.\nThe heating element heats up and starts glowing red hot.\nThat’s what causes the typical electric infrared heater glow.\nElectric infrared heater with the typical glowing infrared heating elements\nBecause the heating element merely heats up without causing any chemical reaction, it does not produce waste material such as water vapor or toxic gases.\nElectric infrared heaters usually consume 1,500W of power. Correspondingly, because all of that power ends up as heat radiation, they produce 1,500W of heat.\nThat’s enough for keeping most large living rooms warm.\nHowever, 1,500W in electricity can be a bit expensive. In fact, the same heating power would cost you only around a third with a propane infrared heater.\nLet’s have a look at these.\nDo fuel or gas-burning infrared heaters have to be vented? Fuel or gas-burning heaters always have to be vented. There are some portable gas heaters that don’t need immediate venting.\nThese, however, increase the humidity in your room. And if your room lacks oxygen, there’s a chance of toxic carbon monoxide emissions.\nSo, even portable gas heaters need venting after some time to remove the humidity from your room and to keep the oxygen levels in your room up.\nThere are other fuel and gas-burning heaters that need installation and ductwork. These are not portable.\nThe ducts automatically vent the heater, so you don’t need to open your windows.\nFuel and gas-burning heaters always need venting, whether it’s immediate venting (through an installation of ducts) or spontaneous venting (by opening the windows regularly).\nThe advantage of fuel and gas-burning infrared heaters are the following:\nHeat based on fuel and gas costs only a third of the same heat based on electricity You can run a fuel or gas heater anywhere without relying on the electric grid Fuel and gas-based heaters can output a lot more heating power than electric heaters. Electric heaters produce up to 1,500W while fuel and gas-based heaters can easily output over 3,000W (roughly 10,000 BTU and more). Recommended ventless infrared heater My favorite ventless infrared heater is this Dr. Infrared Heater DR-968 (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis infrared heater produces 1,500W of heat, which is more than enough for most living room-sized spaces. You can use it in a cabin or in an RV as well.\nI’ve already written an extensive infrared heater review about this model.\nOne reason I like this one so much is that it has a wooden case that does not break down over time.\nInfrared heaters tend to get very hot and you can only run an infrared heater for long durations if it is made of non-meltable material.\nBest ventless gas-based infrared heater As we’ve seen, most people interpret the term “infrared heater” as electric-only. However, propane gas heaters such as this Mr. Heater Big Buddy (click here to view it on amazon) are infrared heaters as well.\nThis model needs no immediate venting. So, you don’t need to install it and you can bring it with you anywhere you like.\nThis model is propane-based. Propane produces water vapor when burning. So, you might want to vent your room occasionally to get the humidity out.\nThere’s also a risk of carbon monoxide production if you use it in a very poorly ventilated space.\nSo, only use this one if you have a window or other types of vents available.\nConclusion There are electric, gas, and fuel-based infrared heaters. Only electric infrared heaters never need venting, since they don’t rely on a chemical reaction (which produces waste material) to heat.\nElectric infrared heaters usually produce about 1,500W of heat. That’s good enough for most living spaces, such as your home or an on-grid cabin.\nHowever, if you need portable heat for an RV or an off-grid cabin, portable propane heaters are far superior.\nThey are more cost-effective than electric heaters and they produce much more heat. All of that without relying on an electric grid.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/do-infrared-heaters-need-to-be-vented/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDo infrared heaters need venting?

Also, place your infrared heater facing into the room, or facing directly toward people. The technical efficiency of infrared heaters is always 100% since all electric energy ends as heat.\nAlso buy an infrared heater that fits your room’s size. Preferably, get a powerful model with a built-in thermostat. This way, the heater adapts itself to the room.\nAlso, keep your space heater at a comfortable temperature.\nCan you make infrared heat more efficient? Before getting into this article, let me describe three different types of efficiencies.\nTechnical efficiency - How much power does your heater consume and release?\nPerceived efficiency - How much heat do you actually get from your heater?\nCost efficiency - How much heat do you get for your money\u0026rsquo;s worth (return on investment)?\nIf we talk about technical efficiency, electric resistance heaters are always 100% efficient, as input power (electrical) always equals output power (heat).\nSo, the technical efficiency is already ideal, and it’s impossible to improve it further.\nIf we talk about cost-efficiency and perceived efficiency, you can make an infrared heater more efficient.\nYou have to adjust your room\u0026rsquo;s insulation, temperature settings, and placement of your infrared heater.\nHere’s how:\nImprove infrared heater efficiency through proper placement Placement is everything when it comes to improving your infrared heater’s perceived efficiency.\n“The closer your infrared heater is to you, the less power it will have to consume to keep you warm”\nYou can either set your infrared heater to heat the entire room (for an even heat distribution), or you can place it close to you (to heat only you - for a very high perceived efficiency).\nPlace the heater in a corner facing your room Infrared heaters increase the temperature of an area through infrared (heat) radiation. The radiation hits objects or people in your room and causes them to heat up.\nFor a maximum radiation spread, place your infrared heater in a corner and face into the room.\nThis way the heat distributes itself evenly within the room.\nPlace the heater facing the people in your room The closer you get to an infrared heater, the more heat you perceive.\nSo, just by moving closer to a heater, you will feel warmer without actually increasing the temperature settings of the heater.\nYou could also move the heater closer to you and reduce the temperature setting accordingly. This way you save money and energy while still feeling the same amount of heat.\nThis increases the perceived efficiency of your heater.\nPlace your heater facing away from (large) windows Obviously, you should never run an infrared heater facing toward a wide-open window.\nThe part of the radiation reaching the window is wasted.\nBut what if you place your infrared heater in a way that it faces a closed window? This could, for example, be the case when you face it toward yourself, but there\u0026rsquo;s a large window behind you.\nThe answer is that glass blocks and reflects infrared radiation. It lets visible light pass, but not infrared.\nHowever, from a physicist\u0026rsquo;s (or engineer\u0026rsquo;s) point of view, glass lets a distribution of wavelengths pass. The classic mathematical distributions assign values ≠0 to any input number.\nSo, I’d assume that glass does not reflect infrared radiation perfectly. A fraction of infrared will leave through the window.\nAnd that’s why you should avoid windows (even though they are not the heat sinks one could expect them to be).\nImprove infrared cost-efficiency through insulation Insulation will help you increase the efficiency of your space heater. While the heat your infrared heater produces is constant, the amount of heat leaving your room reduces.\nThat’s why insulation improves your infrared heater’s cost-efficiency.\nHere’s what you can do:\nClose the doors and windows Before turning your infrared heater on, close all the doors and windows of your room, as it will help you lock the heat inside and won\u0026rsquo;t let the cold enter.\nWhen the doors and windows are open, the space will become larger for the heater to heat, and it consumes more energy.\nSo, if you want your infrared heater to heat efficiently, close the doors!\nInsulate all gaps If there are gaps in your room window, walls, and doors, heat will leave, allowing the outside air to sneak into your room.\nTherefore, blocking the gaps below the door, cracks, or any other space through which your heat radiation can escape is essential.\nYou can use thermal curtains, bubble wraps, insulated glass units, fiberglass, spray foam, and foam tape to seal windows and cracks.\nAlso, you can use heavy fabric to block the below-door area, but it is a temporary solution.\nI recommend using an under-door drafts stopper. It is made of rubber, and you won\u0026rsquo;t have to remove it repeatedly as it is comfortable.\nIncrease cost-efficiency by reducing power consumption If you want to reduce the power cost and increase the efficiency of your infrared heater, the easiest thing you can do is to set your heater settings at a moderate temperature and place it closer to you.\nSetting your infrared heater at a high temperature will keep it running and consume more power to retain that temperature.\nSet your infrared heater at a comfortable temperature facing towards you. It will still heat you well enough.\nChoose the right infrared heater size A small heater in a large space will take more time and consume more energy to warm up the whole room.\nSmall heaters will consume power continuously without actually making you feel any warmer.\nLarger heaters with built-in thermostats will heat, and then cut off the heating when the desired temperature is reached.\nSo, you can’t really pick a too-large infrared heater. You can only pick too small heaters.\nIs your thermostat working fine? If your thermostat device is not working correctly, it is not be able to instruct your infrared heater when to start heating.\nYou can quick-check your thermostat by running your space heater in a very small room (such as a storage room).\nTurn your infrared heater on with full power and see if it turns off on its own after some time.\nIf it doesn’t turn off within a few minutes and it completely overheats the small room, then likely your thermostat has an issue.\nThis will cause your infrared heater to overconsume energy when you run it in your living room or bedroom as well.\nIn this case, I would recommend getting a new heater.\nWhat if your infrared heater is still not heating efficiently? If, after trying every single efficiency improvement idea in this article your infrared heater is not heating well, there could be an issue with your infrared heater itself.\nMy favorite one is the Dr. Infrared Heater Dr-968 (click to see my review) .\nAre infrared heaters more efficient than regular heaters? Yes, infrared heaters are more efficient than regular space heaters. It\u0026rsquo;s because of its working principle, as it emits infrared radiation to warm the object.\nInfrared radiation is directional and heats people and objects directly.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what makes infrared heaters more efficient than other types of space heaters.\nThe only prerequisite is that you use your infrared heater correctly.\nI hope the tips in this article helped you improve your infrared heater\u0026rsquo;s heating capabilities!\nI\u0026rsquo;d say insulation and placement make the biggest efficiency difference!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-make-an-infrared-heater-more-efficient/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIncreasing the efficiency of an infrared heater is easy, and you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a technician to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, I will give you some tips for increasing infrared heater efficiency and reducing energy costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Answer:  \u003cstrong\u003eYou can increase your infrared heater\u0026rsquo;s perceived efficiency by adequately insulating your room (windows, cracks, and gaps below the door).

In this article, we’re going to measure the temperature of my infrared heater’s heating elements.\nThen, we can check whether this temperature is night-safe (i.e. will it burn or melt anything?).\nAlso, I am going to recommend you a night-safe infrared heater.\nQuick answer: Yes, you can run a quality infrared heater overnight given it is made of fireproof material and has built-in overheat protection. The radius of up to 2 feet in front of a space heater has to be free of any objects, as within this radius high temperatures up to 750°F can occur. Place your infrared heater at a safe distance from your bed without any objects blocking the heat radiation.\nHere’s an infrared heater that you can use:\nRecommended infrared heater for overnight usage The best infrared heater for 24/7 usage is this Dr. Infrared heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt is superior to most other infrared heaters because it is made of real wood (which has a higher ignition temperature than plastic).\nThe Dr. Infrared heater is strong enough to heat any room to a comfortable temperature. You can run them safely overnight in your bedroom or living room.\nStill not sure? This one is my favorite infrared heater. So, I’ve dedicated an entire page to it. Read my full Dr. Infrared Heater review here.\nAnyways, let’s have a look at the experiment I did:\nHow hot does an Infrared Heating Element get? (Experiment) When you use an infrared heater overnight, it is important to know which temperatures occur in front of it.\nOnly by knowing these temperatures, we can know whether infrared heaters can be a safety hazard.\nTo find out, I placed a styrofoam block in front of my running infrared heater.\nBy varying the distance of the styrofoam block and measuring the styrofoam’s temperature using a laser thermometer, we can find out how infrared heat spreads!\nHere’s the result:\nThe display of my laster thermometer displayed values between 750°F and 900°F depending on where I pointed it.\nWhen I switched the measurement unit to Celsius, it showed “\u0026gt;500°C”.\nThat’s very hot.\nNote that this is the surface temperature of the heating elements.\nThe air in front of the heating elements is not that hot.\nAn average infrared heating element gets up to 870°F. Heating elements that consume more power will likely get even hotter.\nThe heating element under test consumes 400W of power. The temperature was measured when turned on along with a second 400W heating element, resulting in a total power consumption of 800W.\nI suspect that space heaters with higher power (e.g. 1,500W) do not necessarily get hotter. Instead, they use larger heating elements or more heating elements in parallel.\nInfrared heating element temperature measurement: It\u0026rsquo;s over 870°F!\nHow does the temperature of an infrared heater change with distance? An infrared heating element has a surface temperature of up to 870°F (465°C). As radiation spreads with increasing distance, the temperature of an infrared heating element measured from 5 inches is 327°F (164°C), and measured from 10 inches it’s only 176°F (80°C). Any distance above 15 inches from infrared heating elements is absolutely safe for humans, pets, and materials.\nHere’s a graph displaying the temperature change with increasing distance.\nThe temperature in front of my infrared heater. Measured using a Bosch laser thermometer and a styrofoam block.\nAs you can see, infrared heaters get very hot in close proximity. But within a radius of 15 inches, the temperature cools down quickly.\nAt 5 inches and closer my styrofoam block started smoking and melting!\nThat’s why I couldn’t measure the temperatures even closer to the heating elements.\nHere’s the same data in table format.\n**Distance (in inches)****Temperature (in °F)**0 inches870°F5 inches327°F10 inches176°F15 inches133°F20 inches101°F25 inches87°F30 inches79°F35 inches74°F40 inches72°F\nCan infrared heating elements melt or ignite something? Infrared heater cases are often made of plastic.\nIn the table below we can see that most plastic materials start melting in the mid-200°C-range.\n200°C is 392°F.\n**Plastic types****Melting Point Range (℃)**Acrylic220 - 250CAB - Cellulose Acetate Butyrate170 - 240HDPE - High-Density Polyethylene210 - 270LDPE - Low-Density Polyethylene180 - 240Nylon 6 or Polyamide230 - 290Polycarbonate280 - 320Polyester PBT240 - 275PET (Amorphous)260 - 280PET (semi-crystalline)260 - 280Polypropylene (Homopolymer)200 - 280Polystyrene170 - 280PVC - Polyvinyl chloride160 - 210TPE - Thermoplastic Elastomer260 - 320melting point data from plasticranger.com\nThis means: Yes, an infrared heater can potentially melt any plastic that is in very close proximity (\u0026lt;5 inches) to it.\nThe surface temperature of the heating element is well over 750°F, which is well above the 392°F. required to melt plastic.\nThat’s why I don’t recommend running plastic infrared heaters overnight.\nEven though they have built-in reflectors that reflect the heat outward, heat will accumulate with time.\nInstead, use solidly built wood-case infrared heaters, such as the one I recommended at the beginning of this article.\nWood won’t melt.\nThe spontaneous ignition temperature of the wood is over 1100°F (600°C). Spontaneous ignition is ignition by temperature without any (human) intervention such as kindling.\nSo, wood is infrared heater safe.\nDo infrared heating elements break down? Infrared heating elements are usually simple electric resistors made of carbon, metal wire, or ceramic.\nEven though they appear similar to fragile light bulbs (because of their glow), they are very different.\nInfrared heating elements usually consist of solidly built parts that don’t “burn out” as a lightbulb would.\nA thick metal wire or a piece of ceramic does not wear out or even break.\nSo, the heating element itself does not limit the time you can use your infrared heater.\nIt is very unlikely to break.\nDo infrared heaters overheat? Modern infrared heaters likely don’t overheat.\nThe first reason is their structure and design. Infrared heaters have a large opening to let the infrared radiation escape. This opening naturally prevents overheating.\nBut most modern infrared heaters have built-in overheat protection. The overheat protection in a space heater constantly monitors the temperature.\nWhen the temperature is too high, the safety mechanism cuts off the heating.\nSo, it’s very unlikely that an infrared radiator overheats.\nWell-built models (such as the Dr. Infrared heater I recommended earlier) won’t overheat when you run them overnight.\nAnd even if they do, they cut off the heating.\nOn top of that, you can even set a timer on the heater’s front panel to auto-shutoff the heating after the set time.\nDo infrared heater power cords overheat? The power cord that is attached to your infrared heater can usually handle the current your space heater draws.\nProblems arise as soon as you connect your space heater to an extension cord.\nCheap small gauge extension cords that are not designed for heavy-duty loads will overheat!\nThe reason is that these cheap extension cords have a too large electric resistance. Electrons have to “press through” this resistance. They bump into metal atoms inside the wire, which, in turn, wiggle around and cause overheating due to internal friction.\nAlways use a proper extension cord with your space heater.\nCheck this article for a heavy-duty extension cord recommendation:\nCan you use an extension cord with a space heater?\nWhere to place an infrared heater overnight? For running your infrared heater overnight, I recommend placing it at least 5 feet or more from your bed.\nAny closer than that will likely get uncomfortably hot at night.\nIdeally, for overnight heating, your infrared heater should stand on an elevated surface, such as a stool or a small pedestal.\nThis way you increase the amount of radiation that directly reaches you. Direct radiation increases the heat you feel.\nAnd, in turn, you can decrease your infrared heater’s heating setting to save some energy (and money).\nConclusion Yes, you can use an infrared heater overnight. However, make sure you use a quality space heater with built-in overheat protection.\nIdeally, the infrared heater should be of a material that’s hard to ignite such as solid wood or fireproof plastic.\nMake sure that no objects are within a close distance of your infrared heater, as the temperature rises exponentially, the closer you get to your infrared heater (as we’ve seen in the experiment).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-run-an-infrared-heater-overnight/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you run an infrared heater all night?

Usually, the window kit that comes with a window AC does not fit perfectly and leaves room for heat to enter your room.\nSo, let’s have a look at some improvements you can make to improve your window AC’s insulation (and, therefore, its cost-efficiency)!\nQuick answer: You can add insulation around a window AC by gluing styrofoam panels around the sides. To close all air gaps, use spray foam or foam tape. If available, close your outdoor shutters to reduce the amount of heat entering your room.\nIn this article, we’re going to check three different kinds of insulation:\nInsulation around the window AC (side panels, air gaps between window and window AC) Insulation inside the window AC Insulation outside the window AC (the window glass itself) Let’s have a look at all the different ways to improve your window ACs insulation!\nHow to insulate a Window AC for better efficiency Window ACs usually come with a window kit for installation. The purpose of the window kit is to cover the open area around your window AC.\nHowever, these window kits are usually made of cheap plastic. So, they don’t insulate well.\nAnd on top of that, they are one-size-fits-all (with moveable parts) to fit your window. Likely they don’t fit your window perfectly and (small) air gaps remain.\nHere are the steps to maximize your window AC’s insulation:\n#1 Add styrofoam panels around the window AC A lot of outdoor heat enters your room by penetrating the thin plastic window kit. So, that’s where we start insulating.\nThe most straightforward insulation is to just stick styrofoam panels to the window kit.\nStyrofoam is a very good insulator. And it is cheap.\nBefore sticking it to the window kit (around the window AC), you should measure the dimensions of the side panels of your window kit.\nThen, you can cut the styrofoam panels to this exact size.\nYou could even get a large-size styrofoam panel and cut out a rectangle matching the dimensions of your window AC in the middle of it.\nThen, you won’t have to deal with separate styrofoam panels. Instead, you have one large piece that fits your window AC.\nHowever, that’s only a design choice. Insulation-wise it does not really make a significant difference.\nTo glue the styrofoam panels to your window kit you can use either a specific styrofoam glue or any regular white glue you already have at home.\n( Styrofoam is not heavy, so you don’t need strong glue )\n#2 Insulate air gaps around the AC using spray foam Now that you’ve covered the side panels of your AC’s window kit with styrofoam, let’s close the remaining gaps.\nSpray foam is ideal for covering any holes and gaps around the window AC’s sides.\nSpray foam has three advantages that make it very well-suited for window AC insulation:\nIt insulates well You can fill very narrow gaps using the spray foam’s supplied spray tube Spray foam expands and fits any space perfectly without exerting pressure These advantages make it very well-suited for thick windows, or windows sitting in a thick frame.\nSpray foam is great for insulating volume.\nIf instead, your window and its frame are very thin, a layer of HVAC tape would also do the job.\n#3 Use foam tape for insulation Most window ACs come with accompanying foam tape. Foam tape is a kind of tape that has foam attached to the non-sticking side.\nIf you don’t have one already, get this weatherstrip tape(click here to view it on amazon).\nYou can use foam tape to insulate the sides around your window AC, as well as below the window.\nSince foam tape is designed to stick to plastic surfaces, it is also well-suited to insulate gaps anywhere in the side panels of the window kit.\nThe best advantage of foam tape when you compare it to the other insulation methods is that it’s very subtle.\nAnd it does not look like it’s do-it-yourself insulation such as spray foam or styrofoam panels.\nAdditionally, foam tape requires little installation work. It’s just taping something, with no skills involved.\n#4 Close outdoor shutters to minimize heat entering If you have shutters located on the outdoor side of your house, close them until they reach the window AC.\nShutters will block off a large part of the heat.\nSince they are located outdoors, they will block off the heat before it reaches the inside of your room.\nThis shutter insulation does not work for shutters located inside your room! In this case could even increase your room temperature, since they absorb sun rays. This is a process that converts light to heat.\nOn very hot days, just closing your shutters will reduce your window AC’s power consumption.\nAnd it requires no installation work.\n#5 Insulate internal ducts with HVAC tape HVAC tape (click here to see it on amazon) is a special metal-coated tape that is used for sealing air gaps in HVAC systems.\nAlso, HVAC tape is used to insulate hot (or cold) ducts.\nYou can use HVAC tape to close any cracks in your window AC’s case. Especially, if your window AC is old and worn out, closing cracks and gaps directly on the window AC will make a difference.\nNote that HVAC tape is not for closing gaps between your window and the window AC.\nIt is only for closing cracks in the window AC itself!\nYou can also open your window AC and add insulation to the internal ducts using the HVAC tape.\nHere’s how you can add insulation to your window AC ducts:\nLeave the window AC running for a few minutes Turn it off and feel which ducts are warm Insulate the hot ducts using HVAC tape #5 Add window insulation foil to your window Window insulation foil is an insulating foil that you can stick to your window. It lowers the amount of heat penetrating your window.\nSo, it’s a kind of insulation that does not directly affect your window AC, but rather the area surrounding it (the window itself).\nWindow insulation foil is not really necessary. But if you want to maximize your window AC’s efficiency, then you can consider it.\nWindow insulation foil usually diffuses the light, so your window won’t be clear after installing the insulating foil.\nThat’s why I don’t recommend it for rooms you spend a lot of time in. The enjoyment of having a clear window is worth more than the efficiency improvement you get.\nConclusion Of all the types of insulation, we looked at, sealing the gaps around the sides of your window AC will make the biggest efficiency difference.\nSo, closing the gaps using foam tape or spray foam should be your priority.\nThe other insulation methods are just a bonus for maximum efficiency!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-insulate-a-window-ac/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow can you insulate a window air conditioner?

Even though they are one of the most-efficient AC types, their running cost adds up over time.\nIn this article, I\u0026rsquo;m going to explain 3 essential things you should do to make your window AC more efficient.\nQuick Answer: You can make your window AC more efficient by insulating windows and gaps below your door. Also, clean the evaporator coil and air filter. To avoid efficiency-decreasing dirt accumulation, clean your window AC’s internals yearly. Additionally, use high-quality extension cords (instead of cheap ones) and run your AC on a moderate cooling setting.\nThe efficiency of a window AC defines how well it utilizes electric power to produce cold air.\nIn other words, if your window AC is not cooling efficiently, your unit consumes more power.\nLet’s have a look at some of the tips you can use to make a window AC more efficient.\nImprove window AC efficiency through insulation Your window AC\u0026rsquo;s efficiency can be increased by changing a few things in your room, and you won\u0026rsquo;t even need to touch your unit.\nAll you have to do is to insulate your room correctly, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you how you can do this easily.\nKeep your doors closed If you are using a window AC in your room, ensure every door of your space is closed before turning it on.\nThis will allow you to lock all the cooling inside your room and prevent heat from entering it.\nAlso, if the room doors are open, window AC tries to cool the air outside the room as well and consumes energy accordingly.\nIf you close your room doors, your window AC will not have to consume more power to cool down the area outside the room.\nAlso, your room will remain cold even after turning off your window AC unit.\nInsulate the Window AC setup As window ACs are installed on the windows and walls, there is a high possibility of gaps in the Window AC setup.\nThese gaps can ruin your room\u0026rsquo;s cooling, allowing the outer heat to enter and the inner cool to leave.\nThat is why it is important to properly seal the gaps and insulate the window AC setup to save cooling and bills.\nIf your unit is set up on a window, make sure to seal the gaps between the frames of the lower and upper sash.\nThere should be no gaps or cracks around the panels (side panels).\nYou can also insulate the window AC setup by:\nUsing thermal curtains Using Bubble wrap to seal the opening in your window Doing removable magnetic insulation Using fiberglass Spray foam insulation Using foam tape (to air-seal the window) Block the gap below the door I\u0026rsquo;ve already discussed how hot air can ruin your room\u0026rsquo;s cooling if it makes its way into your room. Therefore, you should block the gap below the door to prevent this from happening.\nAny heavy or thick fabric can block the gap below your door. It may, however, cause problems when opening and closing the door.\nI\u0026rsquo;d recommend using an under-door draft stopper (usually made of rubber) to block the below-door area.\nThe best thing about the draft stopper is that you won\u0026rsquo;t need to remove it repeatedly as you open or close the door.\nFor more window AC insulation tips, check out: How to insulate a Window AC (for efficiency)\nImprove window AC efficiency through maintenance Maintenance of a window air conditioner is essential as it helps keep it fresh and increases its life and efficiency.\nWhile maintaining your window air conditioner, you must clean its filter and coil and schedule maintenance once a year.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s start with the maintenance of your window AC unit.\nClean the Coils The function of the coils is to move the hot air out of the space and let the cool air in through the window AC unit.\nThis process attracts dirt and dust. If there is dirt, the unit will have to work more, reducing the AC\u0026rsquo;s lifespan and increasing energy bills.\nTo allow it to work efficiently, clean the coils using a brush and a cloth (you can also use a handheld vacuum cleaner).\nHow to properly clean the coil? The first thing you should do is turn off the window air conditioner. Remove the front panel and clean the unit\u0026rsquo;s fins using a soft brush or a cloth. Clean the unit\u0026rsquo;s coil using a coil cleaner ( it can be foam or water solution). You can also use soapy water instead of the coil cleaner, but make sure to dry out the parts before you turn on the unit.\nClean the filter The filter is like a superhero of a window AC, as it stops dust particles from entering the window AC unit and keeps it clean.\nThese dust particles accumulate on the filter, making it clogged after some time (If not cleaned frequently)\nWhen the filter is clogged, your window AC consumes more power to get the air from the filter.\nCleaning the filters is necessary because it keeps the air quality fresh and helps make the window AC work more efficiently.\nEven though it is easy to clean the filters, we tend to forget them more easily. You should clean the filter dust buildup at least every week, and if you are not using it regularly, then at least once or twice a month.\nAlso, you can use soapy water and rinse it with water.\nHow to clean your window AC filter? First, check the user manual of your window AC unit and remove the front panel accordingly. You will see the filter; press it a little until it comes out.\nI recommend dry-brushing your AC filter, since water enhances mold and bacteria growth.\nAt least in my personal experience, air filters tend to stink after rinsing them with water. So, I rather dry brush all the dust off.\nThe filter should not be damaged as it will let the dust go through, damaging the unit. Replace it if it is damaged.\nIf you want to avoid any dust inside the unit during off-seasons, you can cover it using the AC covers. It will be helpful to prevent debris and dust from building up in the unit.\nCovers avoid not only dust but also rust.\nPerform a yearly AC maintenance If you are using your window AC without servicing it for a long time, then it will likely consume more energy.\nNot only will it consume more energy, but it will also provide poor cooling.\nWhen a window AC keeps running without thorough maintenance, the dust particles will settle down in your unit.\nAs a result, the coil and filter will get choked, and your the AC unit’s internal heat transfers (to remove the heat from your room) won’t work efficiently.\nAnd you end up with repair costs and energy costs.\nSo, make sure to schedule complete maintenance of your window AC unit once a year (or at least every two years).\nReduce your window AC\u0026rsquo;s power consumption You can make your window AC more efficient by decreasing the power consumption of your unit.\nThe power consumption of window AC is inversely proportional to its efficiency.\nPower consumption = BTU (Cooling Capacity) / Efficiency\nIf we somehow manage to reduce the power consumption of our window AC, the efficiency will increase.\nBelow are some of the methods you can use to reduce the power consumption of your window AC unit.\nUse a heavy-duty extension cord If you use an extension cord to supply the power to your window AC unit, ensure it\u0026rsquo;s not worn out and is low-quality.\nIf you use a low-quality and worn-out extension cord, it consumes more power to power your window AC unit.\nAlso, it can get overheated after some time, causing damage to your unit or any electrical hazard.\nSo, make sure to get an extension cord that can withstand more current than your window AC draws.\nIt will help you save bills and get the best performance out of your window AC.\nFor example, if your window AC draws 19A current, your extension cord must be a heavy-duty extension that can withstand 20A current.\nAlso, do not use long extensions and power cords because they increase total power consumption.\nRun your AC at moderate cooling settings The best and easiest thing you can do to reduce power consumption is to set your AC settings to moderate cooling.\nThe logic is simple if you set your window AC to its extreme settings, it will keep running to decrease the room\u0026rsquo;s temperature. (According to the cooling settings)\nAs a result, your power consumption will increase, and efficiency will decrease.\nSo, Setting your window AC temperature at a moderate temperature is ideal for energy saving and attaining a comfortable temperature.\nWhat to do if your window AC is still not cooling enough? Even after trying all these hacks mentioned in this article, you still struggle to improve your AC\u0026rsquo;s efficiency and reduce energy bills. It\u0026rsquo;s time to replace your window AC unit.\nThere could be two main reasons your window AC is still not cooling enough after trying these hacks:\nYour window AC is very old. Your unit has been through several repairs. So, if your AC falls on this list, then it\u0026rsquo;s to replace your unit with a new and more powerful one.\nI will highlight some signs if you\u0026rsquo;re still unsure whether you should replace your AC. If your AC shows these signs, then you must replace it.\nThe window air conditioner is older than ten years. The unit is making a lot of grinding or scratching noises. When turned on: it smells smoky/burning. It needs a lot of repairs from time to time to function. I\u0026rsquo;ve recommended a few best window AC in a separate article. If you want to buy a new one, you should check this one: Best Air Conditioner for Small rooms\nConclusion If the efficiency of a window AC is less, it consumes more power to perform well. The higher consumption of power increases energy bills.\nWith a few simple hacks, you can improve the efficiency of your window AC and cut down on your energy bills.\nInsulate your room and window AC setup properly. Clean the coils and filters of your unit frequently. Also, Keep your settings at moderate cooling.\nIf these hacks don\u0026rsquo;t work for you, your AC may need a repair, or it\u0026rsquo;s time to replace your window AC for good.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-make-a-window-ac-more-efficient/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWindow ACs are power-hungry!

Candles produce very little carbon monoxide. That’s not enough to cause poisoning unless you light many candles in a small, unventilated space, which would increase carbon monoxide emissions.\nBut that doesn’t mean lighting candles is 100% safe. Since carbon monoxide is undetectable by all five senses, it can be difficult to establish when the CO from candles is nearing dangerous levels.\nLet’s learn more about the relationship between candles and carbon monoxide and other gases.\nCandles Produce CO Candle wax, regardless of type, is made of hydrogen and carbon. When you burn a candle, the hydrogen and carbon mix with the oxygen in your room to make carbon dioxide (co2) and water vapor. The candle ends up as these two gases in the air.\nUnfortunately, candles don’t burn perfectly or completely.\nEven with enough oxygen in the room, 0.1% of the chemical reactions will burn with too little oxygen, which is what we call incomplete combustion.\nThat 0.1% causes carbon monoxide production. This happens with any candle, not just petroleum-based ones.\nHowever, if the room is small or unventilated, there’s less oxygen there to enable sufficient combustion of the candle.\nSo instead of producing carbon dioxide and water vapor, the candle will produce more carbon monoxide.\nThat’s because carbon monoxide is caused by the reaction of carbon and oxygen, where there isn’t enough oxygen for the reaction to form carbon dioxide.\nHow Much Carbon Monoxide Can Humans Tolerate? Carbon monoxide concentration is measured in parts per million (ppm). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends staying below 9 ppm for homes or 35 ppm averaged during an 8-hour timeline.\nAs the concentration rises above 10 ppm, you will start experiencing problems such as headaches, nausea, flu-like symptoms, fatigue, and vomiting with time.\nCarbon monoxide concentration of 100 ppm and above will lead to confusion, intense headaches, brain damage, and eventually a coma and death over a long exposure.\nBut that’s not all. A concentration of 100 ppm will cause a headache in about an hour. The same concentration will lead to unconsciousness and death in about 4-6 hours, so the length of exposure matters.\nThankfully, candles, even scented candles, produce less than 2 ppm of carbon monoxide in a typical airy room. Of course, this concentration will go significantly higher if the candle is burning in a small, unventilated room, such as a bathroom.\nMany Candles Increase the Risk of CO Poisoning While one or two candles in an airy room may not cause significant problems, burning too many candles at once is unsafe. The more candles you have in a room, the higher the carbon monoxide concentration is.\nFor instance, lighting 7-8 candles in a bedroom will make the C0 concentration go up to 7-9 ppm. This is still safe for a short time, but in the long run, the carbon monoxide will start to take effect in the body.\nOn the other hand, lighting this number of candles in a small unventilated room such as a bathroom, which is very common, will increase the concentration significantly because there is less oxygen in there.\nIf you must have a candle-lit bath, open the bathroom window fully so oxygen can flow in. Try also to limit your time in that bathroom to avoid prolonged exposure.\nDo Scented Candles Produce More Carbon Monoxide? No, scented candles do not produce more carbon monoxide than unscented ones. The fragrance and dyes in candles play no role in carbon monoxide production. However, they can contribute to the emission of other harmful substances.\nFor instance, petroleum-based wax releases carcinogenic toxins such as benzene, formaldehyde, toluene, and acetaldehyde that present as soot in the air.\nThese are the same toxins produced by diesel fuel. And depending on what type of dyes and fragrances are added to the candle, the pollution may be worse.\nA good solution to this is to use beeswax or soy wax candles. They may be a little more expensive, but they are non-toxic and long-lasting.\nHow to Reduce the Risk of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning from Candles The first step to reducing the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning from candles is to ventilate the room.\nLeave a window open when burning several candles, especially if the room is not so big or airy.\nThis alone will reduce the risk significantly because the carbon monoxide can leave the room, and more oxygen is getting in.\nOther steps you can take include;\nBurn a few candles at a time Keep the number of candles you burn simultaneously to a minimum. One candle may not produce enough carbon monoxide to cause poisoning, but several of them will. And if a candle is big and comes with several wicks, count each wick as a separate candle.\nBurn candles for a short while Do not burn candles for more than 4 hours.\nMost candle manufacturers write that on the package because prolonged exposure to the by-products of burning a candle is unsafe.\nIn other words, do not leave a candle on when going to sleep. Besides the risk of prolonged carbon monoxide exposure and other gases, you also risk burning the house down.\nInstall a CO detector A carbon monoxide detector looks and works the same way a smoke detector does. Install a detector in every room where you use candles.\nOnce the carbon monoxide concentration is 100 ppm, the detector will go off and alert you of danger so you can extinguish the candles and leave the house.\nStay alert While a CO detector works really well, 100 ppm is high for some people. For instance, carbon monoxide will affect you much earlier if you have asthma, heart issues, and other respiratory problems.\nI recommend listening to your body closely when you have candles on. If you feel a headache, nausea, breathlessness, or sense the air is getting too stuffy, extinguish the candles immediately.\nNote however that candles may not be the only source of carbon monoxide in your house.\nAnything that burns fuel, including your cooker, and gas or fuel-based space heaters could cause CO too.\nFinal Thoughts Candles of all kinds produce trace amounts of carbon monoxide and can cause CO poisoning. However, you can prevent this by allowing enough ventilation inside the room and burning only a few candles at a time.\nProvided you take the necessary precautions when burning candles, you should be able to enjoy your colored and scented candles in the house and even the bathroom.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-candles-cause-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eQuick answer: \u003cstrong\u003eYes, candles can cause carbon monoxide poisoning, but it’s highly unlikely.

Sure! But you have to make sure you use a proper power source!\nQuick answer: Yes, you can use an oil-filled radiator in an RV. You can run any oil-filled radiator off shore power, off a generator, or off the batteries using an inverter. However, electric heating is not always the most cost-effective form of heating when you are off-grid.\nIn this article, we’re going to check all you need to know about oil-filled radiators. And in the end, we’ll see whether there are better heating options for your RV!\nRecommended oil-filled radiator for RVs You can run any oil-filled radiator in an RV. So, I would recommend you a model that is just as well-suited for indoor usage.\nMy favorite oil-filled radiator is this Pelonis oil-filled radiator (click here to see my review).\nBut, honestly, you can get just about any oil-filled radiator you like. All heaters are the same.\nYou could also get a smaller-sized 800W oil-filled radiator. Especially, if you don’t have the space.\nBut I found that they don’t provide enough heat for most RV sizes and in the end, you’ll opt for a stronger heater anyways.\nHow much power does an oil-filled radiator draw? Most oil-filled radiators draw 1,500W of power. That’s just enough to keep a regularly-sized RV heated.\nIn an average household, running a 1,500W device for an hour would cost 21 cents, assuming an average electricity cost of 14 cents per kWh.\nThat’s the latest published US-official electricity rate. However, in reality, I’d suspect the cost increased significantly in the meantime.\nSo, I’d estimate the real cost in the upcoming months to be closer to 35 cents per hour of running a 1,500W space heater (on full power).\nIn an RV, you usually don’t need to blast your space heater on full power, except during wintertime. So, the average power consumption of a space heater would be closer to 1,000W, reducing the hourly cost to 20 cents.\nCan RVs provide enough electricity for an oil-filled radiator? To run an oil-filled radiator, you will need a power source that can provide at least 1,500W of power.\nRealistically, it should provide at least 2,000W of power since you are using other devices in simultaneously.\nRVs have the following energy sources:\nRV shore power Shore power is the power coming directly from the area\u0026rsquo;s electric grid. So, it’s almost the same as using your home’s wall outlet.\nShore power should always be capable of running a 1,500W space heater.\nRV batteries You can even run a space heater off car batteries or an RV battery pack. However, this is very costly, since you will need large batteries and an inverter.\nAdditionally, an oil-filled radiator will drain an average battery within 3 hours. After that, you’re left in the cold with an empty RV battery.\nSo, that’s not really an option.\nGenerator If your RV power source is a generator, then you can power your oil-filled radiator with it.\nThe only requirement is that your generator produces more than 2,000W of power.\nBut that’s the case for almost all generators.\nSolar Mobile solar panels won’t produce enough power to run a space heater.\n“To run a space heater continuously, you need 20 solar panels” Can you run a space heater off solar panels?\nCan you run a space heater off solar panels?\nHowever, if you use a solar-powered battery, you will be able to generate enough electric energy for 1 or 2 hours of heating per solar panel.\nSolar panels absorb the most energy from the sun when the weather is clear and the sunshine is perpendicular to the earth.\nUnfortunately, this is usually the case during summer. That’s the main disadvantage of powering a space heater with off-grid solar panels.\nYou can only reasonably use solar panels if your RV has a fixed place and your solar panels are connected to the neighborhood\u0026rsquo;s electric grid and employ net metering.\nWith net metering, you feed energy into the grid instead of using it to charge your batteries.\nWhatever amount of energy you generate compensates for the electricity you use. And you will only have to pay the difference.\nBut usually, most people move their RV around so this is not really an option.\nHow to reduce power usage of an oil-filled radiator Power is limited in an RV.\nIf you are off-grid a lower power consumption causes your batteries to last longer.\nSo here are a few things you can do to reduce your oil-filled radiators\u0026rsquo; power consumption.\nDecrease the temperature setting The most straightforward thing to do is to decrease the temperature of your oil-filled radiator.\nLower temperature means lower power consumption.\nUse a heavy-duty extension cord If you’re powering your oil-filled radiator directly off a generator (or any other power source placed outdoors) and you use an extension cord, make sure you use a heavy-duty one.\nThe right extension cord makes a significant difference in the heating efficiency.\nA thin, cheap extension cord has a higher electrical resistance and, therefore, heats up quickly.\nIf your extension cord is partially outdoors, the hot extension cord will radiate a part of the heat energy outdoors. That’s obviously of no use.\nCheck this article to see which extension cord you can use: Can you use an extension cord with a space heater?\nInsulate your RV This one is actually my favorite tip!\nInsulation is always a one-off expense. And after adding insulation it pays off for years!\nHave a look at your RV and see where it lacks insulation. Maybe the walls are too thin? Or there are gaps in the walls where cold air can come in.\nFix your insulation using styrofoam (for covering large areas). Close the gaps using an insulating foam spray.\nThis will make a big difference. And not only will insulation prevent the heat from escaping in the cold seasons, but it will also prevent the heat from entering your RV in summer!\nAre oil-filled radiators safe in an RV? Yes, oil-filled radiators are the safest space heaters and they are completely RV-safe.\nIn contrast to other space heaters, oil-filled radiators don’t have an exposed heating element.\nInstead, the heating element is embedded in the large metal body.\nThe oil inside the metal body then distributes the heat from the heating element to the metal surface.\nThis heat distribution is what makes an oil-filled radiator so exceptionally safe.\nConclusion For off-grid heating in an RV, oil-filled radiators are not the best type of space heater.\nOil-filled radiators need a lot of electricity. So, you will have to either get a large battery or power them off shore energy only.\nInstead, my suggestion for off-grid heating would be to use an off-grid heat source, such as propane.\nI’ve written an article about propane heaters for RVs already, so have a look at that!\nPropane heaters are independent of any electric grid or batteries. They work reliably when it’s cold, even when you have an electricity outage.\nAnd on top of that, propane costs less than half of what electric heat would cost!\nThat’s why I would prefer a propane heater over an electric heater anytime!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-use-an-oil-filled-radiator-in-an-rv/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you use an oil-filled radiator in an RV?

Or will it take damage from the humidity, or even be a safety threat?\nIn this article, we’re going to check whether and how to use oil-filled radiators in bathrooms, along with the necessary safety precautions.\nQuick Answer: Yes, you can use an oil-filled radiator in a bathroom. The large metal heating body is completely safe, even when water is splashed on it. Only the front panel of an oil-filled radiator contains sensitive electronics. So, avoid exposing it to water. An electric shock from an oil-filled radiator by accident is almost impossible unless you really try. Also, oil-filled radiators need no ventilation.\nIf you are looking for a safe bathroom radiator, I recommend having a look at this Pelonis oil-filled radiator (click to see my review).\nBut actually, you can use any oil-filled radiator. They are all very similar.\nAre oil-filled radiators safe in bathrooms? Oil-filled radiators are the safest space heaters for humid and closed areas like bathrooms.\nUnlike other space heaters, there is no burning process involved, and the heating element and circuit are covered within the large metal body and below the front panel.\nLet’s have a look at all the different reasons why oil-filled radiator heaters are safe for heating your bathroom.\n#1 Oil-filled radiators are fully enclosed systems Oil-filled radiators have channels inside metal fins or columns or sometimes a single flat panel.\nIn the channels, thermal oil circulates, absorbing the heat from the heating element, and warming up the metallic surface.\nThe best thing is that the high-power heating components are enclosed inside this metallic body and are not exposed to water sprinkles.\nSo, oil-filled radiators are safe as there is no water damage and short circuit risk.\nHowever, it is not like a lot of water will not damage it.\nObviously, if you accidentally pour a glass of water at your oil-filled radiator, water will enter into it, and you know the consequences (short circuit or any electrical hazard)\nEspecially the front panel, which contains sensitive electronics (and maybe a thermostat), is prone to water damage.\nEven though these electronic components are also embedded in a casing, they are not waterproof.\nSo, try to keep your oil-filled radiator away from water. Even if the risk of damage is low.\n#2 Oil-filled radiators reduce the relative humidity In oil-filled radiators, a heating element heats the oil, which transports the heat to the large metal surface area.\nWhen your bathroom’s temperature increases, the relative humidity decreases, because hot air has a much higher water-holding capacity than cold air.\nSo, water won\u0026rsquo;t be able to settle on your (hot) oil-filled radiator and damage any parts.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;d recommend not leaving your oil-filled radiator in the bathroom after use. Then, humidity doesn\u0026rsquo;t build up on the heater when the bathroom is cool again.\nWater-holding capacity of air with increasing temperature: Hot air can holt a lot more water than cold air.\n#3 Oil-filled radiators do not need ventilation Fuel or gas-burning space heaters always need ventilation, since they burn the oxygen in a room.\nLuckily, that\u0026rsquo;s not the case for oil-filled radiators.\nIn an oil-filled radiator, there is no chemical fuel-burning process such as in fuel or gas-based heaters.\nTherefore, they do not produce carbon monoxide or other toxic gases. This makes the radiators ideal for small rooms or rooms with poor ventilation.\nSafety tips for using oil-filled radiators in bathrooms No doubt, it\u0026rsquo;s safe to use oil-filled radiators in bathrooms, but still, radiator heaters are electrical devices, and I\u0026rsquo;d recommend not messing with them and using them carefully.\nI will highlight some safety precautions for using your heater in the bathroom to enjoy your warm bath safely.\n#1 Place your oil-filled radiator in a corner exposed to as little water as possible When setting an oil-filled radiator in a bathroom, make sure to put it in a place where it\u0026rsquo;s not exposed to too much water.\nWater exposure could damage your oil-filled radiator.\nYes, I\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about how safe oil-filled radiators are with water sprinkles throughout this article. But still, due to the constant exposition of water sprinkles, water would manage to make its way into the heater and may cause hazards.\nThe best practice is to find a place in your bathroom that remains dry or with as little water as possible.\n#2 Connect the power cord tightly Oil-filled radiators run on electricity, so you need to plug them into a wall outlet to power them. In this case, there is a risk of electric shock or short circuits if the cord is not tightly connected.\nWhen you don\u0026rsquo;t connect the cord firmly, water will find its way through small gaps between the outlet and the power plug.\nSo, make sure to insert the plug of your radiator completely, leaving no space for water.\nYou should also check your power cord for scratches and damage. If the power cord is faulty, replace or tape it.\n#3 Use a secure wall outlet Before placing your oil-filled radiator heater, make sure the corner you choose for your oil-filled radiator has a secure outlet to power your oil-filled radiator.\nWhen discussing secure wall outlets, GFCI outlets are best to ensure the safety of your oil-filled radiator and yours.\nAs the name suggests, a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) interrupts the power if it notices any ground fault.\nSo, when there is even a slight current fluctuation (which can be caused by contact with water, short circuit, appliance damage, etc.), the GFCI will stop the power supply immediately, preventing any severe hazard.\nI\u0026rsquo;d not recommend setting up your oil-filled radiator or any space heater in your bathroom if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a GFCI outlet installed.\nWhat are the safest heaters for bathrooms? Oil-filled radiators are the safest type of electric space heater for bathrooms.\nBut central heating or underfloor heating is always safer for heating your bathroom, just like your room, without worrying about safety precautions.\nIn these heating systems, the heat is transferred to the area (in our case, the area is the bathroom) through the air (fans) via ducts, and water or steam passes through pipes while the heat source is placed somewhere else in the building (usually, central point).\nSo, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to place your heater in the bathroom and deal with electrical wall outlets.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-use-an-oil-filled-radiator-in-a-bathroom/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you use an oil-filled radiator in a bathroom?

In this article, I am listing all of the possible reasons!\nI’ll tell you exactly how to test each cause and how to fix it.\nThe list is sorted by issue frequency. So, the most common reasons are listed first.\nQuick answer: To fix a window air conditioner not cooling, ensure that all airways are free. Clean the evaporator coil. Ensure that the power supply is OK and that there is no issue with the power cord. Also, properly insulate the window setup of your window AC. If nothing helps, get a new window AC.\nReasons and fixes for a window air conditioner not cooling Let’s have a look at the complete list of causes and fixes!\nClean clogged air filters The most common reason for a window AC not cooling is that it can’t blow any air! And air movement is very important in an air conditioner.\nThe air is responsible for transporting the cold into your room.\nSo, if a window AC is clogged internally, it can’t blow out cold air at all. Or if it’s only slightly clogged, the window AC might look and sound like it’s working, but it won’t put out enough cold air to really make a difference.\nHow to check: Checking whether your air filters are clogged is very easy. Most window ACs open right on the front panel.\nThere, you can take out the air filter (no tools required) and see whether they are dusty.\nIf your air filters are not dusty, you can further open the window AC (tools required) and see whether the internals are filled with dust.\nHow to fix: Remove all the dust you find in your window AC using a dry brush. Never wet air filters!\nI see so many people do this (in YouTube videos)\u0026hellip; They wet-clean their filters and then slide them right back into the AC.\nNever do this.\nInstead, dry brush the air filters using this air conditioner brush set (click here to view it on amazon).\n( Or just use any regular brush you have at home already - old toothbrushes work perfectly well )\nThe reason you want to dry-brush your window air conditioner is that this takes off most of the dust, mites and bacteria without enhancing their growth.\nWater and dust combined are a perfect living environment for bacteria and mold.\nSo, if you don’t want your air conditioner to stink after cleaning it, don’t use water to clean the air filters!\nEnsure the wall outlet is working If your window air conditioner is not only not cooling, but also not even turning on, it could be that an element of the wall outlet that your window AC is connected to is broken.\nLuckily, this is easy to check.\nHow to test: Grab another device and plug it into the wall outlet. Does it turn on?\nIf it turns on, then your wall outlet is fine.\nIf it doesn’t turn on, then test whether your window AC turns on when connected to another wall outlet (which you know is working). In case your window AC turns on, then you found the reason.\nElse, the fault is likely in your window AC’s electronic power element.\nHow to fix: If you found your wall outlet to not supply any power, check the fuses or circuit breakers in your electric service box.\nIf you find a fuse blown, exchange the fuse with a new one. In case you find a circuit breaker tripped, just switch it back to the original position.\nHowever, if you found your window air conditioner still not working, even after connecting it to a working wall outlet, the fault is likely in the window AC’s power module.\nRepairing the power module requires good electronics knowledge. You will have to find the broken part (a blown capacitor or burned resistor) and replace it with a matching part.\nIf you know how to do it, go ahead.\nElse, better let a professional fix it. Or, actually, it could be even cheaper to just get a new window AC.\nEnsure the extension cord is OK When using a window air conditioner with an extension cord, you should always make sure that your extension cord has the proper gauge to be able to handle the window AC’s current requirement.\nIf you have a cheap extension cord and you don’t know for sure whether it is suitable for your window AC, you can check out my guide on extension cords for ACs.\nHow to test: The best way to check an extension cord is using an electric measurement device such as a multimeter. With a power multimeter, you can check whether the input power reaches the other end of the extension cord.\nAlso, you can check whether the cord is broken and if there’s a connection from one end to the other.\nHow to fix: If you detect any issue with your extension cord. Or even if you are not sure about the extension cord you have, you should get a heavy-duty extension cord.\nWindow ACs draw a lot of current. And most regular extension cords are not able to handle it.\nEither they overheat or they increase your window AC’s electricity consumption or both.\nClean the evaporator coil A window ACs evaporator coil should never be clogged or dirty! The evaporator coil carries heat from your room’s air to the refrigerant (which in turn evaporates and absorbs the heat - hence the name).\nIf your evaporator coil is dirty, then your window AC won’t cool your room, even if it’s running.\nHow to test: Open your window AC’s side (or front, or wherever the coil is located - cross-check with your manual).\nAfter you locate your evaporator coil, you should be able to see whether it’s dirty.\nHow to fix: Use an air conditioner coil cleaning foam (click here to view it on amazon) to dissolve and brush off all of the dirt.\nYou can use the special brushes included with an AC brush kit. But you can just as well use any other old brush you have lying around.\nInsulate the window setup properly A window air conditioner always needs to be well-insulated in order to function properly. There should be no gaps around it!\nIf there are any air gaps or improperly insulated spots around your window AC, heat from outdoors will enter your room. And this will annihilate your window ACs cooling (at least partly).\nSo, a proper window setup always goes along with proper insulation.\nHow to check: The easiest way to inspect your window setup’s insulation is visually. Just inspect the area around the window AC.\nCan air leak into your room anywhere?\nHow to fix: If you find poorly insulated spots, then you have two options.\nMost window ACs come with an insulation kit. Usually, this kit is good enough. Ask yourself whether the gaps in your setup are the kit’s fault, or whether they are caused by careless installation.\nIf you conclude that the gaps are your fault, reinstall the window AC properly and carefully. Work precisely and close any gaps. If the leaks are due to the kit not properly fitting your window, then you should insulate the gaps around your window AC using an insulation foam.\nUsually, when you get a window or portable AC, you also get a small roll of insulation foam.\nGet that and install it. If you don’t have it, just buy and install your own insulation material. This is the insulation foam roll I got with my (portable) AC:\nDrain water Window ACs absorb water from your room’s air. The water, in turn, has to go somewhere.\nNow, this differs from model to model, but usually, window ACs accumulate water in the bottom part of the outside component.\nYour AC might have a sensor detecting an overflow which causes a reduction in cooling. Or the overflowing water pan might inhibit the cooling in some other way.\nNormally, all of the accumulated water should evaporate (through the condenser’s heat). But on very humid days, new water accumulates faster than it can evaporate.\nHow to test: Go around the house to the outside part of your AC and check where the water accumulates.\nHow to fix: Attach a drain hose to drain the water. Alternatively, you can place some gauze (acting as a wick) in the back of the AC.\nSet the AC to cooling mode Some window ACs can switch between a heating and cooling mode. In case your window unit is set to heating mode, it won’t cool your room.\nHow to test: Check the front panel display whether there is a heating or cooling setting available. Also, check your remote for an option. If you don’t find anything, look it up in the manual or online for your specific window AC unit.\nHow to fix: If your window AC is set to heating mode, simply switch it back to cooling. It should start blowing cold air immediately.\nFix the broken thermostat Window ACs have a built-in thermostat that measures the current room temperature. Based on the room temperature, the thermostat calculates the cooling power necessary to get your room to your desired temperature.\nThen, it commands the compressor.\nIf your window AC’s built-in thermostat is broken, either mechanically through impact (while cleaning, or the unit falling down), or electrically (through a blown capacitor, or a broken sensor), your window AC won’t cool.\nHow to test: Check the temperature display on your window AC. Which current temperature does it display?\nIf the displayed room temperature is off, the thermostat’s thermometer is broken.\nElse, open your window AC, locate the electronic circuitry and look for broken parts.\nIt could be that the thermostat is not a separate component but integrated with other electronic components on one circuit board.\nIn this case, you will have to check the entire electronics and look for faulty parts.\nHow to fix: Replace damaged parts with matching replacement parts. You can find replacements online.\nTo do this, you should be familiar with electronics and ideally know how to replace soldered parts.\nWindow AC still not cooling? If you still can’t figure out why your window AC is not cooling, or your electronic skills do not suffice to fix it, then I’d say just order a new unit online.\nWindow ACs are the most cost-effective and affordable kind of air conditioning system. And you can find good ones for not too much money.\nI recommend this 12,000 BTU Midea AC (click here to view it on amazon). This model is strong enough to cool rooms up to 300 square feet.\nIf that’s too much for you, just choose a smaller BTU option of the same model.\nBut honestly, any window AC will do the job!\nSo, just pick one you like.\nAttribution: title image by jasoneppink\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-window-air-conditioner-not-cooling/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour window air conditioner is not cooling?

I\u0026rsquo;m going to share some of the potential causes of why your oil-filled radiator is not getting hot so that you can check and fix those problems and get your heater running again\nQuick Answer: Oil-filled radiators stop heating because of a broken thermostat. Also, the thermostat can cut off the heating if the room is already warm. Furthermore, oil-filled radiators will not start and get hot if the power supply and extension cord are faulty.\nWhy is my Oil-filled radiator not getting hot? Here is the full list of causes and fixes for your oil-filled radiator not heating!\n#1 Broken Thermostat Thermostats measure your room\u0026rsquo;s temperature. And based on the temperature, they set the heating element\u0026rsquo;s input power.\nA broken thermostat either does not measure the temperature of your room properly. Or it miscalculates the heating power of the heater.\nHow to check: If your oil-filled radiator has a room temperature display, check it and see if it shows a plausible value.\nIf the current room temperature reading is off, then it\u0026rsquo;s likely that your thermostat\u0026rsquo;s built-in thermometer is broken.\nUnfortunately, testing whether a thermostat is broken without such a temperature display is not straightforward.\nHow to fix: To fix the thermostat, you will need a good understanding of electronics. Usually, you will have to replace either individual electronic parts on it, or the entire thing.\nIf you don’t know how to do it, just buy a new oil-filled radiator. They are inexpensive and it will save you a ton of troubleshooting time.\nFor replacing the entire thermostat, first, make sure you\u0026rsquo;re buying the right one for your oil-filled heater.\nIdeally, you should take a picture of the old thermostat installed, then remove it, and wire up your new thermostat according to the picture you took earlier.\n#2 Room is warm enough already The built-in thermostat activates the heating only if your room is colder than the temperature you set on the heater.\nSo, if your room is warm enough already, then the thermostat will not allow the oil-filled radiator to heat up until the room is cold again.\nHow to check: Check your heat settings on the heater\u0026rsquo;s front panel (if there is one) and the temperature of your room. If your room is warm already, then you\u0026rsquo;ve found the reason.\nAlternatively, you could try running your oil-filled radiator outdoors (in the cold), and see whether it turns on there. If it works outdoors, but not indoors, that\u0026rsquo;s a sign of your room being warm enough.\nHow to fix: Increase the heating setting.\n#3 Thermostat is set to a too-low temperature It\u0026rsquo;s not always the case that your oil-filled radiator is at fault when it\u0026rsquo;s not getting hot. Your heater may not get hot if you\u0026rsquo;ve set your heater at a very low heat setting.\nThis issue is related to the previous one. If you set your heater at a very low setting and your room temperature is already above your desired temperature, your heater will not get hot.\nHow to check: Check your settings on the front panel of your oil-filled radiator; if it\u0026rsquo;s very low, you\u0026rsquo;ve found the problem.\nHow to fix: You need to change the setting of your oil-filled radiator from low to high enough. You can start from 5 degrees and if it does not heat enough, then increase it by 5 again.\nOr just set it to full power and see if your oil-filled radiator finally turns on.\n#4 Faulty Power supply or Extension Cord A power supply provides power to the oil-filled radiator to allow it to heat up and increase the temperature of the surroundings.\nIf there is an issue in the power supply, the heater will not get the desired power to work; hence it will not heat up.\nApart from power supply issues, there is a possibility that the extension cord you\u0026rsquo;re using with your space heater is faulty and not providing current to your heater.\nHow to check:\nEnsure it is adequately plugged (it might have loosened). Check for damage, bite, or sparks. You can plug your power cord into other outlets to ensure the power supply outlet is not faulty, You can use a multimeter to check the power supply and extension cord (Set the knob to voltage or current, connect in parallel to the connections in case of voltage, and series to the circuit in case of current. Check if the multimeter is giving a correct reading or not). How to fix:\nIn case of a faulty outlet, you need to replace the socket or get one that can withstand the load of the heater, If the power cord is damaged, you can use tape to fix it temporarily. However, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend buying a new extension cord with a good current handling capacity (ampere rating) #5 Overheat-protection triggered through blocked airways It could be that your oil-filled radiator has a built-in auto shut-off feature that triggers upon sensing blocked airways.\nThis feature cuts off the heat, if anything, covers the radiator part of the heater to ensure safety and prevent hazards.\nHow to check: You need to check if something is covering the radiator part of the heater, i.e., a piece of cloth or a curtain.\nHow to fix: Remove anything that traps heat from your oil-filled radiator\u0026rsquo;s surroundings. Your radiator should always keep distance from the curtains.\nIf you put a blanket over your oil-filled radiator to warm you up better, or you run your radiator under a desk, place your oil-filled radiator in an open space (in the center of your room) and try running it there.\n#6 Tip-over protection active The oil-filled radiator has a tip-over protection feature that prevents it from turning on when it is not on level ground.\nHow to check: If your oil-filled heater is tilted, not standing firmly on the ground, or lying on its side, tip-over protection will protect it from turning on.\nYou can try tilting your oil-filled radiator (while it\u0026rsquo;s turned on) back and forth and see whether you hear any clicking sound (that\u0026rsquo;s the tip-over protection).\nHow to fix: Place your heater on solid ground. Try to install your heater on even ground or a hard surface.\nIf it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t turn on, try shaking the heater and see whether that triggers the tip-over protection and turns on the heater.\nIn case your heater only turns on after shaking, that\u0026rsquo;s a sign that the tip-over protection is \u0026ldquo;stuck\u0026rdquo;. In this case, you should get a new heater.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re done checking everything from my list, and your space heater is not heating up, and it\u0026rsquo;s already too old to get repaired, again and again, it\u0026rsquo;s time to buy a new one.\nHere’s my favorite one: My recommended Oil-Filled Radiator\nMaintenance tips for oil-filled radiators In cold regions, specifically, oil-filled radiators are necessary, but these radiators need maintenance; otherwise, they can lead to dangerous accidents or be worn out early.\nTo avoid mishaps and a longer life span for your oil-filled radiator heater, I will give you a few tips.\nNever choose to put your radiator near windows or curtains; simply put it at least 3 feet away from anything; it could be clothes or furniture. Avoid putting the power cords or extensions under mats or carpets in your room You can leave it on overnight, but make sure to turn it off if you are going out for a day or more. Do not use it in the bathroom; simply put it away from water or liquid. Never wrap the power cords right after turning the radiator off. Make sure to service your oil-filled radiator to avoid rusting and clean it. Clean the radiator while it\u0026rsquo;s cool with a dry, clean and soft cloth. It will be ideal to use a vacuum or dryer to clean it. (as it will be able to reach where you cannot). Clean the tubes, pipes, inlets, and outlets to avoid obstruction. The radiator should be balanced, not tiled or lying on the side. Always put your oil-filled radiator in a good-ventilated room or space. Are oil-filled heaters hot to the touch? Usually, the thing which gets too hot to touch in a heater is the heating element.\nThe heating element sits inside the heater\u0026rsquo;s metal body. So, it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to touch it directly.\nSo, the metal surface gets hot, but not extremely hot. Mostly, you can easily touch it for a few seconds.\nHow long does it take for an oil-filled radiator to heat up? The time an oil-filled radiator takes depends on the size of your oil-filled radiator and the space in which you are using it.\nLike, it will take more than 30 minutes to heat up the room properly if you use a small radiator in a large space.\nHowever, a working radiator takes 5-10 minutes to warm up. The heat has to move from the heating element embedded in the oil-filled radiator to the metal surface.\nTo get an accurate answer to how long it takes for an oil-filled radiator to heat up, I experimented with my own heater!\nHere are the highlights of how I experimented with my oil-filled heater:\nI checked the initial temperature of the radiator area using a laser thermometer when the heater was not turned on. It was 56°F. I switched on my space heater on full power. In 5 minutes, the temperature of the radiator area increased from 56°F to approximately 180°F. I also noticed that the bottom part heated up faster than the top part (likely because the heating element is located in the lower part). So, after running your heater for 5 minutes, it should be hot to the touch!\nThe temperature immediately after turning it on:\nTemperature after 5 minutes of running:\nSo, if your oil-filled heater is not getting hot like mine, there must be an issue. I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned every possible issue in this article, along with troubleshooting and fixing guides.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/oil-filled-radiator-not-getting-hot/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour oil-filled radiator doesn’t get hot?

While it is possible, it is not efficient and can cause damage to your stove. A coal stove needs a grate at the bottom in order to allow air from below the fire to burn efficiently. Without this grate, wood stoves won\u0026rsquo;t be able to burn coal properly.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about burning coal in a wood stove, you should first understand the risks and cons.\nThis article will explore the pros and cons of burning coal in a wood stove and help you decide based on your specific needs.\nWhy Can’t You Use Coal In A Wood Burning Stove? A wood-burning stove cannot use coal as fuel because it is not designed to do so. The two materials are burned at different temperatures, with coal requiring a much higher temperature to ignite. In addition, the wood-burning stove does not have a grate that would be necessary to hold the coal in place while it burns.\nIf you try to burn coal in a wood stove, you run the risk of damaging your stove and possibly even injuring yourself. Not to mention, coal is notorious for generating harmful emissions that can contribute to environmental damage.\nBefore trying to burn any type of fuel in your wood-burning stove, be sure to consult the manufacturer’s instruction booklet or call a qualified appliance technician.\nCoal produces a lot of ash and soot when burned, which can clog up your stove and chimney.\nBenefits of Burning Coal in a Wood Stove Coal is abundant and inexpensive, making it an affordable option to heat your home compared to other alternatives. (It may be more expensive than wood, depending on where you live).\nThe main advantage of burning coal instead of firewood to heat your home is that coal burns more efficiently and provides more heat per unit of weight than firewood (approximately two times more BTU/hr).\nThe reason is that coal is a purely carbon-based substance just like wood but without any water.\nThe absence of water is what makes it lighter and hotter than wood.\nHowever, it will only be feasible to use coal in a wood stove, comparing the disadvantages to the advantages.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s talk about some of them.\nDisadvantages of Burning Coal in a Wood Stove Here\u0026rsquo;s why you should not burn coal in a wood stove:\n#1 Damage to Wood Stove Although a wood stove base can withstand the temperatures of burning firewood, it can\u0026rsquo;t do the same with coal.\nThe high temperatures of coal burning will warp the metal components and eventually cause the base to crack - In other words, permanent damage to your wood stove.\nIf you want to burn coal to heat your home, opt for a coal stove or multifuel stove that\u0026rsquo;s specifically designed for this purpose. These stoves are built with thicker walls and materials that can withstand the high temperatures of burning coal.\n#2 Inefficient Combustion Coal is a very inefficient fuel when burned in a wood stove. Although coal produces more heat than firewood, the heat is not sustainable to get the stove going.\nThis means you\u0026rsquo;ll have to use more coal than if you were using an option like wood, which will ultimately cost you more money overall.\nAlso read: 13 Ways to Improve Wood Stove Efficiency\n#3 Chimney Blockage If you\u0026rsquo;re not careful, spending time burning coal in a wood stove can result in blockages to your chimney.\nAs ash and soot accumulate over time, the flue will become clogged up and eventually collapse, leading to significant damage to your home\n#4 Carbon Monoxide Emissions When coal is burned inefficiently, it can produce harmful amounts of carbon monoxide.\nThis gas is poisonous and can cause health problems if exposure is prolonged, so avoid using coal in your wood stove if you\u0026rsquo;re worried about exposure.\nCan I Burn Coal In a Multi-Fuel Stove? Yes, you can burn coal in a multi-fuel stove. However, avoid burning standard house coal as it can clog your stove and produce harmful carbon monoxide emissions. Instead, opt for more expensive coal types that are specifically designed to be burned in wood stoves.\nIs Coal Pollution Harmful? Coal pollution is harmful because it can release toxic gases like carbon monoxide, which are poisonous and can cause respiratory problems.\nAdditionally, coal mining has proven to be one of the leading sources of climate change emissions.\nSo, whether you\u0026rsquo;re concerned about the environment or your own safety, burning coal in a wood stove isn\u0026rsquo;t worth the risk.\nHow to Convert a Wood Stove to Coal? You can convert your wood stove to use coal as a burning fuel by following steps:\nFirst of all, The ash pan must be taken out and the stove must be cleaned completely with a wire brush, shop vac, steel wool, etc. There should be no wood particles left in the firebox. Light the coal to remove excess moisture before putting it into the wood stove. Arrange the coals in a single layer across the bottom of your stove’s firebox. Make sure no voids are there to trap the smoke. Avoid coal stacking over each other. Close all doors and vents before starting your first burn cycle. Start off with a small and hot fire. Slowly open the doors and vents, ensuring the coal is burning. Can You Mix Coal and Wood In a Stove? Just like you can\u0026rsquo;t burn coal in a wood stove without a grate, you also can\u0026rsquo;t mix coal and wood in a wood stove. This is because coal can might reach much higher temperatures than wood, and will eventually damage the stove base.\nCoal produces more heat than wood, so mixing the two could result in a fire that is too hot.\nAdditionally, coal produces more fumes than wood, so mixing the two could create excessive smoke.\nConclusion By now, you should have understood that burning coal in a wood stove is not the best option for energy production. Not only is it an environmentally hazardous practice, but also it can be dangerous if done incorrectly.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re still determined to use coal as your primary source of heat, make sure to follow proper safety guidelines and don’t do so without proper ventilation.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-burn-coal-in-a-wood-stove/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCoal has been used to heat homes and workplaces for centuries, but is it possible to burn coal in a wood stove?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick answer: \u003cstrong\u003eIt is not recommended to burn coal in a wood stove.

Perceived efficiency - How much heat does actually reach you? Cost efficiency - How much heat do you get for your money’s worth? In this article, we are going to cover all three different kinds of efficiencies. For each efficiency type, I am going to give you straight-to-the-point advice on how to optimize your oil-filled radiator!\nQuick answer: Technically, oil-filled radiators are 100% efficient. You can improve its perceived efficiency (the amount of heat reaching you) through proper placement within your room. You can improve the cost-efficiency of your heater by lowering your central heating settings and supplying heat using the oil-filled radiator only in the room you are in.\nLet’s have a look at all the steps you can take:\nCan you improve the technical efficiency of an oil-filled radiator? Most electric space heaters (including oil-filled radiators) consume about 1,500W of power.\nAccording to the thermodynamic law of entropy, all energy eventually ends up as heat.\nThis means that all of the consumed 1,500W of electric power will be converted to heating power.\nThis means any oil-filled radiator is 100% efficient all of the time. And there is no room for optimization.\nAt least from a technical perspective.\nThe reason is that all a physicist looks at is the input power and the output power. And the power you put into a heater is equal to the heating power that comes out of it.\nThere is no way to improve the technical efficiency of an oil-filled radiator since it is already 100% efficient.\nHowever, as humans, we usually don’t really care for technical efficiency, but rather for how well a heater keeps you warm and how much you pay for it.\nThat’s why we additionally look at perceived efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the next sections.\nHow to improve an oil-filled radiator\u0026rsquo;s perceived efficiency Perceived efficiency is not something we measure technically. Rather it’s just a look at how warm a heater can make you feel.\nThe general approach to improving an oil-filled radiator’s perceived efficiency is to find ways to direct the heat toward you.\nSince oil-filled radiators distribute the heat evenly in all directions, this is not at all simple.\nWith other heaters, such as infrared heaters, which radiate heat in one direction only, a simple change in the heater’s placement can have a big positive impact on perceived efficiency.\nAnyways, let’s have a look at what you can do:\nUse a fan to distribute the heat Oil-filled radiators distribute the heat evenly across the room. However, it might be (depending on your room’s structure and the heater’s placement) that the heat is trapped in a corner of the room.\nOr the heat rises to the ceiling without reaching you.\nYou can use a fan to blow the heat toward you. This can be any type of fan. But since oil-filled radiators stand on the floor, I’d recommend a floor fan, such as this Lasko fan (click here to view it on amazon).\nI am using my own floor fan all the time. The best thing about them is that you can use them in wintertime, to distribute heat in your house, but even more so in summer to cool down your house.\nSo, a floor fan is a great thing to have for venting and distributing heat.\nPlace a floor fan behind your oil-filled radiator to blow the heat into your room\nTouch the oil-filled radiator Air is an insulator. That’s why you feel warm wearing thick jackets. The thick material traps lots of air. The air pockets prevent the heat from leaving your body.\nBecause air is an insulator (that prevents the heat from leaving your oil-filled radiator) heating the entire air in your room is generally not very efficient.\nBut as soon as you touch your oil-filled radiator’s metal body, you notice it’s very hot!\nHeat by touch is also called conductive heat.\nIn general, conductive heat makes you feel very warm. While convection (heat transported by air) heat needs a lot of energy to even reach you.\nTo make use of conductive heat, you can place your oil-filled radiator in a way that you constantly touch it. Or at least, very close to you.\nOf course, this does not work for all settings.\nBut I’ve found placing my oil-filled radiator under your desk while working very practical. You can put your feet against the heater. And additionally, the desk traps all the heat.\nAlso, you can place an oil-filled radiator next to your sofa or bed and then throw a large blanket over you and the heater. The blanket traps the entire heat and you will feel a lot warmer.\nDon’t worry about the risk of fire. When you are so close to your heater, you can run it on low settings and it still provides more than enough heat.\nI like to put my feet against my oil-filled radiator. Feels extra warm!\nPlace it in the right spot Even though the placement of oil-filled radiators does not matter as much as with other heater types (such as infrared or gas heaters), it will still make a difference.\nIn general, place your oil-filled radiator as close to you as possible.\nThen, in addition to the warm air coming from the heater, you will also feel the infrared radiation coming from it.\n( Yes, even though oil-filled radiators are not infrared heaters, some of the heat will come off the heater as infrared rays )\nAlso, when you have a tilted ceiling, you can place your oil-filled radiator below it. The tilt in the ceiling helps distribute the heat more evenly in the room.\nUse it in smaller spaces Oil-filled radiators don’t have that much power. Even though 1,500W are close to the limit of what most US household circuits can supply, it’s still only a third of the heat coming off an average propane heater.\nTo heat large rooms (over 350 sq. ft) in the cold season you will need either two oil-filled radiators, or another heat source.\nAlternatively, use your oil-filled radiator in smaller rooms (300 sq. ft. and smaller). Oil-filled radiators are much more suitable for these small to moderate room sizes.\nThe reason is that smaller rooms contain less air to heat. This means that they heat up more quickly.\nSet higher temperature settings It might be that your oil-filled radiator does not heat efficiently because of the built-in heating element not receiving enough power.\nAlso, I find that an oil-filled radiator set to high settings radiates a lot more heat than an oil-filled radiator on lower settings.\nOf course, higher settings increase your heater’s electricity consumption.\nBut in this section, we are only talking about perceived efficiency. And it seems that an oil-filled radiator only really starts radiating heat above a certain setting.\nBelow that setting, the large metal heating body gets warm or even hot, but the heat does not radiate.\nThis is obviously not a technical fact. Any heating setting will provide heating power proportional to it.\nHow to increase an oil-filled radiator\u0026rsquo;s cost-effectiveness In this section, we’re going to cover some ways to improve your oil-filled radiator’s cost-effectiveness.\nCost-effectiveness is the amount of heat your get per dollar spent.\nSince there are only two variables in this equation (heat \u0026amp; dollars spent), you can only do two things about improving cost-effectiveness:\nReduce your electricity rate Increase the heat you get out of your heater You can do something about the electricity rates in some places in the world (not everywhere). But you can’t really increase the heat your heater supplies (without increasing electricity consumption).\nLet’s have a look at my two suggestions:\nSwitch electricity providers (if possible in your location) The Cost-effectiveness of oil-filled radiators is tightly coupled to the electricity rate you are paying.\nIf your electricity rate decreases, your cost-effectiveness increases.\nThe easiest way to increase your oil-filled radiator’s cost-effectiveness is to switch electricity service providers to lower your electricity rate.\nNow, this would not only improve the cost-effectiveness of your oil-filled radiator, but it would positively affect all the electric devices in your home.\nUnfortunately, in the US this works only in the 13 so-called “deregulated states”, where you are free to choose your electricity provider.\nReduce central heating temperature and supply heat using the oil-filled radiator In my article “Do space heaters save money?” I found out how it’s possible to reduce your utility costs using electric space heaters.\nThe result is:\nYou have to reduce your central heating temperature by 8°F and supply heat in the room you are using with your oil-filled radiator.\nThis will cut your yearly energy expenses by $324.\nThis is not really a tip to increase the oil-filled radiator\u0026rsquo;s cost-effectiveness, but instead, you use your oil-filled radiator to increase your entire home’s cost-effectiveness.\nWhat’s a more efficient heater than an oil-filled radiator? Based on the heating power produced and the running cost, there’s not much you can do to improve your heating efficiency. At least, as long as you stick to electric space heaters.\nElectricity is very important since it is such a “high-level” form of energy, which can be used for so many different applications (computing, manufacturing, construction, etc.). Using it for heating is oftentimes a waste.\nWhen you look at the cost-effectiveness of different heaters, you will find that electricity is quite expensive.\nIn contrast, heat from wood or propane costs less than a third of what you would pay for the same amount of heat using electric heating.\nIf you have the option I highly recommend switching to a wood-burning stove or gas heating.\nIt doesn’t matter whether you upgrade your home’s central heating to use wood or gas or you just get a portable propane heater.\nConclusion Oil-filled radiators are already 100% efficient technically. However, you can increase the perceived efficiency by placing your oil-filled radiator correctly.\nIdeally, your oil-filled radiator should stand close to you.\nAnd, if possible you should trap its heat by using it in a small room or by using it below your desk, where you are working, or next to your sofa with a blanket thrown over it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-improve-oil-filled-radiator-efficiency/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow can you improve the heating and cost-efficiency of an oil-filled radiator?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three different efficiencies that we want to optimize for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTechnical efficiency - How much electricity is converted to heat?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePerceived efficiency - How much heat does actually reach you?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCost efficiency - How much heat do you get for your money’s worth?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we are going to cover all three different kinds of efficiencies.

Also, a lack of insulation, or using undersized heaters in large rooms can increase gas consumption.\nWhy is my propane heater using so much gas? The propane heater is famous for its effective performance when heating your house or room, as it\u0026rsquo;s a more economical option to heat the room without electricity.\nBut when it starts consuming more propane than usual, it\u0026rsquo;s time to troubleshoot your propane gas heater.\nObviously, You don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend your valuable money on propane gas refills.\nWithout further ado, let\u0026rsquo;s dive into this article and see how you can fix your propane heater.\n#1 Gas leakage (in the heater, hose, or tank) One of the significant reasons propane heaters use too much gas is leakage.\nAlthough you should do the leakage test every time you use the heater or at least every new season when you start it again, if it\u0026rsquo;s using too much gas, you should immediately check for leakage.\nPropane gas smells like a rotten egg or a dead animal. If you notice that smell, there is undoubtedly a gas leakage somewhere in the tank, hose, or heater.\n( Actually, pure propane gas does not have a smell. But gas companies add the smell so it’s easy to detect leakages )\nHeater Leakage How to check: The smell of the propane gas is one way of checking the leakage area; simply try to find the area by using your smelling sense. When you find the area, apply soapy water or a leakage-detecting solution and turn on the gas supply valve. If you notice the formation of bubbles, then it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a leakage.\nHow to fix: Heaters usually leak when they\u0026rsquo;re old and worn out.Heaters mostly leak after many years of use, so It is best to replace them instead of fixing them because they might also start leaking from other places.\nIf you want to buy a new propane heater, I highly recommend checking out the Mr. Heater Buddy heaters. Here’s a review: Best Propane Heater\nHose Leakage How to check: The process is the same as checking the heater leakage.Apply a soapy mixture or leakage-detecting solution on the hose. If there is a hose leakage, you will see bubbles.\nHow to fix: For quick fixing, you can use duct tape or electrical tape, but the hose has 300PSI of pressure, which these tapes usually can\u0026rsquo;t withstand. The best way is to replace the hose; you can do the replacement by following simple steps:\nTurn off your heater and tighten the valve using a wrench. Get a replacement for your hose and attach it using thread or Teflon tape to ensure proper fitting. Attach it and check the leakage from the hose again. (With the same procedure I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned above) Tank Leakage Tank leakage is also the most common problem in which propane heaters consume more gas than they should. The main reason for tank leakage is rust or corrosion and accidents.\nHow to check: You can check the tank leakage by thoroughly smelling the tank, as there will be a propane gas smell in case of leakage. You can also use a soapy liquid or a leakage-detecting solution and notice if there is any bubble formation.\nHow to fix: You can fix your propane gas tank with minimal effort. Simply find the leakage area, clean the surface, and spread the epoxy over it. If you can do welding, then it\u0026rsquo;s the best solution for the long term.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t recommend messing with your old gas tank because once the corrosion makes its way to the tank, it leaks again and again.\nThe best solution is to replace the tank!\nI hooked up a small 1-pounder bottle with my propane heater. If there\u0026rsquo;s a leak in the connection, you can usually hear a hissing sound.\n#2 The hose is not connected correctly Sometimes we try to find a problem but ignore the small causes.\nSo, just make sure that your connections are tight or not if your propane heater is using too much gas.\nHow to check: Check the plastic fitting attached to the hose and propane tank. There should be nuts on the other end of your house. If nuts are loose, you\u0026rsquo;ve found your problem!\nHow to fix: Check both ends of the hose and tighten the nut and plastic fitting to ensure no leakage. You will need a wrench to tighten the hose nut, and the plastic fitting can be tightened with your bare hands.\n#3 Outside Weather is too Cold Propane heaters can be used in all weather and won\u0026rsquo;t affect performance. But, in freezing weather, the heater consumes more gas to heat the room adequately.\nAlso, when the temperature goes too low, it becomes difficult for the propane gas to reach the burner.\nHow to fix: Properly insulate your room so that your heater can consume less gas to increase the room temperature. Keep your door and window closed so that no outside air enters the room.\n#4 The room is not insulated enough to store heat As mentioned above, the insulated room tends to remain warm for a long-time, and your heater doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to put extra effort into heating the room. As a result, there will be less propane usage.\nAny crack or gap in the wall, door, or window will also be the reason for poor insulation.\nHow to fix:\nBefore using your heater, keep your door and window closed and ensure no escaping. Make sure there are no gaps or cracks in the wall; use duct tape for more proper insulation. Use curtains in front of the windows to keep the heat isolated in the room. #5 Too-Large Room If you have a small heater, the heat it produces is barely perceptible. So it uses up gas. And you don\u0026rsquo;t get much out of it.\nHeaters should always fit the room size.\nHow to test: Check your heater\u0026rsquo;s BTU rating.\nHow to fix: Get a heater that fits your room size. A rule of thumb is that you should get a heater with at least 20 BTU of heating power per square foot of room area.\nRefer to the table below to know the heater size suitable for your room.\n**Heating Capacity (in BTU)****Room Area (in square feet)**5000 BTU100-150 square feet6,000 BTU150-250 square feet7,000 BTU250-300 square feet8,000 BTU300-350 square feet9,000 BTU350-400 square feet10,000 BTU400-450 square feet12,000 BTU450-550 square feet14,000 BTU550-700 square feet18,000 BTU700-1,000 square feet21,000 BTU1,000-1,200 square feet23,000 BTU1,200-1,400 square feet24,000 BTU1,400-1,500 square feet30,000 BTU1,500-2,000 square feet34,000 BTU2,000-2,500 square feet\nThese ratings are recommended by Energy Star Organization\n#6 Malfunctioning Thermostat When a malfunction occurs in a thermostat, the heat cycle gets affected because it senses the room temperature and the heat settings and instructs the gas heater to work accordingly.\nIf a thermostat is not working fine, it fails to detect the temperature, and your heater keeps running.\nHow to Fix: Modern thermostats come with a battery or cells; try replacing them. If the issue persists, then it\u0026rsquo;s time to replace the thermostat. For replacing the thermostat, first, make sure you\u0026rsquo;re buying the right one for your propane heater. Make connections according to the manual.\n#7 Heat Settings are too high Sometimes we set our heat settings greater than we need to heat the room quickly and then need to remember to lower the settings.\nThis is also one of the most common issues behind the high gas consumption in propane heaters.\nHow to Check: The check is simple; all you have to do is to check your heat adjusting knob; if it is set to maximum or higher than your requirements\nHow to Fix: Keep your heat settings automatic so your heater won\u0026rsquo;t stay lit. If you want to set the heat according to your requirements, then make sure not to set it too high.\n#8 The propane heater is not getting enough oxygen The Propane heater only burns at its most efficient point (Ideal burn) if it\u0026rsquo;s getting enough oxygen. When gas is burned, it takes oxygen from the air and reaches it to burn efficiently.\nHow to Check: Firstly, check if there is dust in the oxygen supply. Secondly, adjust or manipulate oxygen valves and observe the quality of the burn.\nFixing: I recommend cleaning the tube using a stick or wire and poking the dust out to unblock the blocked tube, and setting up the oxygen valve at the proper setting (By adjusting it at the right position)\nHow to Calculate the Propane Usage of my Propane Heater? You can find out if your propane tank or heater leaks by just cross-checking with mathematics.\nTheoretically, you can calculate how much propane your heater should use up. And then you can compare it to your actual real-life propane consumption.\nYou can calculate the propane usage of your propane heater by this formula:\nPropane Usage In an Hour = Heating Capacity (In BTU) / (BTU/Gallon × Efficiency (%) / 100)\nHere:\nBTU/ Gallon for propane is 91,500\nIf we assume the burning efficiency to be 90% (so, we already account for suboptimal conditions), then you can calculate propane usage by substituting heating capacity.\nI know it\u0026rsquo;s getting technical, so I\u0026rsquo;ve done the calculation part myself.\n**Heating Capacity (in BTU)****Hourly gas consumption ( in Gallons)****Monthly gas consumption (in Gallons)**5000 BTU0.06 Gallons 21.6 Gallons 10,000 BTU 0.12 Gallons 43.2 Gallons 15,000 BTU0.18 Gallons64.8 Gallons 20,000 BTU0.24 Gallons86.4 Gallons25,000 BTU0.30 Gallons108 Gallons30,000 BTU0.36 Gallons129.6 Gallons40,000 BTU0.49 Gallons176.4 Gallons\nHow can I make my propane heater more efficient? To make your heater more efficient, you should maintain it properly. You need to clean the heater and ensure no damage occurs.\nReplace or clear out the filters of the heaters timely to avoid dust which causes less oxygen reachable to the heater.\nAlso, you should adjust your heater settings to low temperatures to avoid unnecessary gas consumption.\nHow can I reduce my propane usage? Follow a few simple and easy techniques to ensure you do not have to use a lot of propane gas:\nMake sure to clean the heater before using it the first time in a while (in case of seasonal use) The rooms and the space should be properly sealed/ isolated. Check the leakages and damages. Choose the heater size (or settings) according to the space that you want to heat (We’ve added a table above in this article) Now that you’ve read this detailed guide article, you should be able to optimize your propane gas heater for lower gas consumption.

While a small heater can run for many weeks, a very strong industrial-grade heater will only last one day.\nQuick answer: A 100lb propane tank lasts anywhere between 13 hours to 576 hours depending on the heating power. On an average household 9,000 BTU heater, it will last for 192 hours of heating. On a (very) strong industrial-grade torpedo heater it will last 13 hours only.\nLet’s have a look at where these numbers come from. Additionally, I prepared a long table with all heater sizes (in BTU) where you can look up your heater’s heating duration on a 100lb propane tank.\nWhat’s the maximum fill level of a 100lb propane tank? Propane tanks are never filled to 100% of their capacity. The reason is that varying temperature causes propane to expand and shrink a lot.\nTemperature changes affect the volume of propane gas about 17 times as much as water vapor.\nThis causes a propane tank filled to 80% in spring to be at 85% (or higher) in the summer, given that none of the propane was used up.\nThe entrapped propane gas in a propane tank can’t change its volume. The volume is fixed to the tank’s volume.\nBecause the propane can’t expand inside the tank, the internal pressure increases with increasing temperature.\nTo prevent an explosion due to too high pressure, propane tanks are filled only to 80%. The 80%-rule is a safety measure.\nThe remaining 20% of the volume inside a propane tank is air. Air compresses very well (that’s why it\u0026rsquo;s used in suspension parts). So, you can think of the remaining 20% of air as suspension for high-pressure propane.\nTherefore:\nA 100lb propane tank contains up to 80lb of propane.\nHow much energy is in a 100lb propane tank? One pound of propane contains 21,594 BTU of heat energy ( source).\nA 100lb propane tank filled to 80% capacity (maximum) contains\n100 lb × 21,594 BTU per lb × 80% = 1,727,520 BTU\nof heat energy.\nHow much energy do different propane heaters use? There are many different propane heater sizes. Accordingly, they all release different rates of heat energy.\nFor example, a small-sized propane heater consumes 3,000 BTU of heat per hour (denoted in BTU/h).\nA moderately sized propane heater such as the Mr. Heater Buddy and Big Buddy heaters (which I always recommend, click to see my review) consume around 9,000 BTU to 18,000 BTU of heat per hour.\nTank top heaters consume an average of 30,000 BTU to 45,000 BTU per hour.\nLarge patio heaters are usually 45,000 BTU/h.\nIndustrial-grade torpedo heaters consume up to 125,000 BTU/h.\nBecause no two propane heaters are equal, I have prepared a long table of all possible BTU ratings and their respective tank capacity (in hours) below.\n**Heating power (in BTU/h)****Tank capacity (in hours)**3,000 BTU/h576 hours6,000 BTU/h288 hours9,000 BTU/h192 hours12,000 BTU/h144 hours15,000 BTU/h115 hours18,000 BTU/h96 hours21,000 BTU/h82 hours24,000 BTU/h72 hours27,000 BTU/h64 hours30,000 BTU/h58 hours33,000 BTU/h52 hours36,000 BTU/h48 hours39,000 BTU/h44 hours42,000 BTU/h41 hours45,000 BTU/h38 hours48,000 BTU/h36 hours51,000 BTU/h34 hours54,000 BTU/h32 hours57,000 BTU/h30 hours60,000 BTU/h29 hours70,000 BTU/h25 hours80,000 BTU/h22 hours90,000 BTU/h19 hours100,000 BTU/h17 hours110,000 BTU/h16 hours120,000 BTU/h14 hours130,000 BTU/h13 hours\nAs you can see, the smallest heater lasts for at least 576 hours on a 100lb propane tank. Meanwhile, the largest heater would only last for 13 hours.\nAn average indoor propane heater of 9,000 BTU/h lasts 192 hours on a 100lb propane tank. These are the kinds of heaters used in RVs, cabins, garages, or in your living space.\nHow long will a 100lb propane tank last for regular everyday usage? The table above shows the number of hours you can run your heater continuously on a 100lb propane tank.\nHowever, you likely won’t run a heater for 24 hours a day continuously.\nSo, a more realistic approach would be to assume 4 hours to 8 hours of continuous heating a day. This, of course, depends on the weather.\nFor the table, I assume a heater running on 9,000 BTU/h, which is enough to keep a (very) large living space or a large uninsulated cabin or RV heated:\n**Daily heating duration (in hours)****How long does a 100lb propane tank last? (with a 9,000 BTU/h heater)**2 hours96 days4 hours48 days6 hours32 days8 hours24 days10 hours19 days12 hours16 days24 hours8 days\nAs you can see, your daily heating duration impacts the propane tank’s longevity a lot.\nHow to increase a propane tank’s durability You can look up the heating duration of your 100lb propane tank in the table above. All you need to know is your heater’s BTU rating.\nBut how can you increase the time your propane tank lasts?\nHere are a few quick and simple tips:\nThe greatest direct impact on a propane tank’s durability is the amount of gas your heater draws from it.\nSo, the simplest way to increase your propane tank’s durability is to turn down the heating setting.\nOutputting half of the heat doubles the heating duration you get out of your tank.\nAlso, you should check your propane tank, your heater, and the gas hose for leaks. Leaking gas is gas that you can’t use for heating.\nAnd if you are unlucky, a leakage will drain gas even if the heater is not running!\nYou can check this by connecting your heater to the propane tank, and then listening for a hissing sound (without the heater turned on).\nConclusion A 100lb tank lasts for 192 hours on a strong 9,000 BTU/h indoor heater. That’s 8 days of continuous heating (which is usually way more than you need).\nYou can expect a 100lb propane tank to last you for 3-4 weeks of usage when you heat it for 8 hours a day.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-long-does-a-100lb-propane-tank-last/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow long a 100lb propane tank lasts depends entirely on the propane heater that you connect to it.

But what if your house or RV doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a chimney?\nQuick answer: Yes, you can run a wood stove pipe through a window by using a pre-made window plate kit or making one yourself using double-walled metal pipes and a metal sheet to cover the window space. Ensure the pipe is angled upwards and lifted above the roof to increase efficiency.\nGetting the proper materials and a safe installation plan is vital. Let’s look at the steps.\nHow to Run a Wood Stove Pipe through a Window There are two ways to run a wood stove pipe through a window:\neither you buy a pre-constructed window plate kit (a bit expensive) or you build your own window kit (more fun, better quality and you save money) Buy a pre-made wood stove pipe kit The easiest way to run a wood stove pipe through the window is to get a ready-made window plate kit because it comes with all the necessary parts.\nThis specific window plate kit from Cylinder Stoves comes with a galvanized 5\u0026quot; wall plate that goes directly on your window (opened), and it already has a hole cut into it for the pipe. It also includes one 5\u0026quot; elbow for the stove and a 6\u0026quot; elbow for the top of the stove pipe.\nBuild your own window setup That said, you can make all this for yourself using a triple-walled pipe and a sheet metal for the window. You can also buy the elbows or connectors to ensure the pipes join together securely.\nYou will also need a step ladder, jigsaw, drill, safety glasses, construction adhesive, and a screw tip attachment.\nHow to install a wood stove pipe window kit If you have your materials ready, here is the step-by-step process of making a wood stove chimney through a window. These steps assume you have the window kit above so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to drill a hole or measure a metal sheet.\nOpen the window just enough to easily fit the metal sheet. Again, a pre-made kit takes the guesswork out of how much room you need on the window; otherwise, you have to make that decision yourself. Attach one elbow temporarily onto the end of the long chimney pipe and fit the other end of the pipe onto the stove\u0026rsquo;s exhaust opening at the back or top. Some kits require a pipe joint to join the two parts, but others do not. Use sheet metal screws and sealant to secure that first connection and make it airtight. Run the pipe out the window, ensuring it\u0026rsquo;s angled upward at a 45-degree angle. Place the metal sheet in the window space while inserting the pipe through the hole. Use duct tape to seal the seams between the window and the metal sheet to keep cold air from getting into the house. Attach the second part of the pipe to the outside elbow, allowing it to go up above your roof. Sometimes you may need to use two connected pipes depending on your roof\u0026rsquo;s height. Ensure you have sealed all the connections using a self-tapping screw and sealant/adhesive. Anchor the outside chimney pipe securely at a safe distance from the wall (12-24 inches). At the top end of the stove pipe, add a chimney cap to keep the wind from blowing fumes back into the pipe. Add a metal sheet on the wall just behind the stove to protect your wall from direct stove heat. Is Running a Wood Stove Pipe through a Window Safe? When done right, running a wood stove pipe through a window is usually safe. But with U.S. Fire Administration terming wood stoves as the most common cause of residential fires, you have to take every precaution to ensure the wooden stove doesn\u0026rsquo;t cause a fire or blow carbon monoxide fumes into your home.\nSome preventive measures here include;\nKeeping the wooden stove 12-36 inches away from the window. This will protect the window panes from cracking due to heat and also ensure your curtains or walls are not too close to the fire. Only use double or triple-walled pipes and seal them well when running the stove pipe through a window. Have a non-flammable platform, such as bricks below the stove\u0026rsquo;s legs to protect the floor. Have proper ventilation in your home, and only use seasoned wood to make a fire. Place a metal sheet on the wall behind the wood stove to keep heat away from the walls. Clean the wood stove and the stove pipes regularly when in use. You can use a long brush to get the creosote off the pipes every couple of weeks. Have carbon monoxide detectors and a fire extinguisher nearby just in case. Where Else Can You install your Wood Stove Pipe? While running a wood stove pipe through a window is the easiest choice if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a chimney, there are other ways. You have a few options for venting your wood stove if you have the right tools and know-how.\nRoof Running a wood stove pipe through the roof is really the best way to vent the stove because the pipe goes straight up without any bends or angles. However, it can be a bit costly since you have to go through the ceiling and roof. You will require a ceiling collar, roof flashing, and of course a hole where the pipe will go through. Ensure the stove pipe extends 3 feet above the roof and has a chimney cap for efficiency.\nWall Venting through the roof is similar to doing it through a window. It may require a horizontal pipe going from the stove to the wall. You must also drill a hole through the wall and insulate the pipe to reduce fire hazards.\nI recommend hiring a professional to cut the hole and help with the installation to save yourself the trouble. But you can, of course, also do it yourself.\nThe window plate kit will also work with wall venting, and you can follow all the steps of running a stove pipe through a window. More importantly, ensure you place a metal sheet between the stove and the wall, and don\u0026rsquo;t place the stove too close to the wall.\nConclusion A wood stove is the most cost-effective method to heat a house in winter without electricity. But if your house doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a chimney to vent it, running the stove pipes through a window is a great option.\nChoose a venting kit with few bends for safe and efficient operation and clean the pipes regularly. Straight, clean chimneys have a better draft which encourages the fire to burn better.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-run-wood-stove-pipe-through-window/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you run a wood stove pipe through a window?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wood stove pipe connects the chimney to the stove, and it\u0026rsquo;s meant to exhaust fumes out of your home.

Whether you can run two portable ACs depends on several factors, such as the power consumption of both air conditioners, the ampere rating of the circuit, and the outlet voltage in your region.\nYou can run two portable air conditioners at the same time if the amount of current they draw from the circuit is less than the ampere rating of the circuit.\nIn this article, we’re going to check whether your home’s circuit can support two portable air conditioners. All you need is the power rating of your portable AC.\nIdeally, you should also know your home’s circuit current rating (15A, or 20A). If you don’t know which one you have, then just assume 15A. Better safe than sorry.\nIf the ampere rating of both portable air conditioners exceeds the circuit\u0026rsquo;s rating, the breaker will trip and cut off the electrical supply.\nYour air conditioners\u0026rsquo; current is determined by their wattage (Power consumption) and outlet voltage.\nI = P ÷ V\nElectric power formula to answer: How much current does a device draw?\nHere:\nI denotes Current\nP denotes Power consumption\nV denotes outlet voltage.\nAccording to the formula of Power, if outlet voltage increases, the current decreases, and if the wattage of air conditioners increases, then they draw more current from the circuit.\nIt is common for circuits to have an ampere rating of 15A or 20A and an outlet voltage of 110V - 120V in the USA and 220 - 230V in the UK and in Europe.\nCan you run two portable ACs at the same time on 15A Circuits? Usually, portable air conditioners use a maximum power of 940 Watts - 1650 Watts. So, to find the exact answer to our question, I will analyze the power consumption and the amount of current portable air conditioners draw.\nI will also highlight the region (As the outlet voltage rating in the US is 120V, and 230V in the UK and Europe)\n**Power Consumption (Wattage)****Can you run two portable ACs Simultaneously? (US-Region 120V)****Can you run two portable ACs Simultaneously? (EU, UK-Region 230V)**1650 wattsNo (draws 27.5 amperes)Yes (draws 14.3 amperes)1,530 wattsNo (draws 25.5 amperes)Yes (draws 13.3 amperes)1,410 wattsNo (draws 23.5 amperes)Yes (draws 12.2 amperes)1,300 wattsNo (draws 21.6 amperes)Yes (draws 11.3 amperes)1,180 wattsNo (draws 19.6 amperes)Yes (draws 10.2 amperes)1,060 wattsNo (draws 17.6 amperes)Yes (draws 9.2 amperes)940 wattsNo (draws 15.66 amperes)Yes (draws 8.17 amperes)\nSo, It’s clear that you can’t run two portable air conditioners in the USA (110V - 120V), as both will draw more current than the circuit breaker ampere rating (15A), and your ACs would trip.\nFor Europe and the UK region (220V - 230V), you can easily run two portable ACs, because they would draw less than 15A altogether.\nCan you run two portable ACs at the same time on 20A Circuits? **Power Consumption (Wattage)****Can you run two portable ACs Simultaneously? (US-Region 120V)****Can you run two portable ACs Simultaneously? (EU, UK-Region 230V)**1650 wattsNo (draws 27.5 amperes)Yes (draws 14.3 amperes)1,530 wattsNo (draws 25.5 amperes)Yes (draws 13.3 amperes)1,410 wattsNo (draws 23.5 amperes)Yes (draws 12.2 amperes)1,300 wattsNo (draws 21.6 amperes)Yes (draws 11.3 amperes)1,180 wattsYes (draws 19.6 amperes)Yes (draws 10.2 amperes)1,060 wattsYes (draws 17.6 amperes)Yes (draws 9.2 amperes)940 wattsYes (draws 15.66 amperes)Yes (draws 8.17 amperes)\nAs you can see in the above table, the scenario is slightly different for a 20A circuit.\nIn the USA you can only run two portable ACs on a 20A circuit if their power rating is below 1180W.\nIn Europe you can always run two portable ACs because both ACs would draw less than 20A altogether.\nCan you run two portable air conditioners on different circuits? If you have a dedicated circuit for each portable air conditioner you want to run (for example two separate rooms), then you can run two portable air conditioners simultaneously.\nThe problem is running air conditioners on the same circuit because it may exceed the ampere rating of the circuit breaker (15A - 20A), causing it to trip and cut off the power.\nWhat’s the best alternative to running two portable air conditioners? As you see, two portable air conditioners running in a room simultaneously on the same circuit is not a good idea considering the combined power consumption of both ACs.\nIt will increase energy consumption, and you don’t want to spend too much on energy bills, right?\nInstead of running two portable ACs simultaneously, a much more energy-efficient cooling method is using a single window air conditioner.\nMy personal recommendation is this BLACK+DECKER window air conditioner (click here to view it on amazon).\nWindow air conditioners consume less power, and are more powerful and more efficient than portable air conditioners.\nAnother advantage of window air conditioners is that they don’t occupy floor space, so they are very well-suited for small rooms or larger rooms with little floor space.\nNow, let’s see how Window AC is better than portable AC in terms of energy and efficiency.\nComparing the Efficiency of Portable and Window ACs As we’ve discussed before, the power consumption of Portable ACs ranges between 940W - 1650 W (rough estimate); it’s time to analyze their BTU (cooling capacity)\nBy dividing the cooling capacity by the power consumption, you get an efficiency rating that tells you how much BTU of cooling you get per Watt of power.\n**Power Consumption In Watts****Cooling Capacity (in BTU)****Efficiency (BTU per Watt)**1,650W14,000 BTU8.48 BTU / Watt1,530W13,000 BTU8.49 BTU / Watt1,410W12,000 BTU8.51 BTU / Watt1,300W11,000 BTU8.46 BTU / Watt1,180W10,000 BTU8.47 BTU / Watt1,060W9,000 BTU8.49 BTU / Watt9,40W8,000 BTU8.51 BTU / Watt\nSo, the efficiency of most portable ACs ranges from 8.4 to 8.5. Now, let’s compare it with window ACs.\nWindow ACs have less power consumption and BTU (Capacity). But are they as efficient as portable ACs? Let’s have a look!\nPower Consumption (in Watts)**Cooling Capacity (in BTU)****Efficiency (in BTU per Watt)**1100W11000 BTU10 BTU / Watt1000W10000 BTU10 BTU / Watt900W9000 BTU10 BTU / Watt800W8000 BTU10 BTU / Watt700W7000 BTU10 BTU / Watt600W6000 BTU10 BTU / Watt500W5000 BTU10 BTU / Watt\nNow, you can see that the efficiency of portable ACs is greater than that of window ACs.\nAccording to these numbers, a window AC is 17.64% more efficient than a portable air conditioner.\nHence, the running cost of portable ACs is always higher than window ACs.\nAlso, a window AC requires no space in the room (as you just need a window to install your AC in).\nSo, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend replacing your portable AC with a window AC.\nCan I use a portable AC in a room with no windows? Although a window is the best option to vent out warm air from the portable AC, there are other options as well.\nA pipe can be installed through a large hole drilled in the wall or ceiling to exhaust the warm air. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to drill the hole, you can use the door to vent your portable AC.\nConclusion Yes, you can run two weak portable ACs on US wall outlets simultaneously. And in Europe and the UK, you can run any two portable ACs simultaneously.\nBut doing that is not very efficient.\nInstead, you should get a window air conditioner. Window air conditioners provide more cooling for your money and will look a lot better than having two portable ACs blocking half of your room’s floor space.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-run-two-portable-air-conditioners-at-once/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRunning two portable air conditioners simultaneously on the same circuit is not a good practice, as it will increase energy consumption or may trip your circuit breaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut still, if you want to run two portable ACs simultaneously, I\u0026rsquo;ll show you whether you can do it or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you an alternative to portable ACs that will consume less energy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Answer: \u003cstrong\u003eYou can run two portable air conditioners at the same time on the same circuit if they do not draw current more than the ampere rating of the circuit (15A - 20A).

In the corners? Or in the middle of the room?\nIn this article, we’re going to check different space heater placements and how they affect your heater’s efficiency.\nQuick answer: You should place your space heater facing toward the center of the room or the area where people are. The closer you place your heater to people, the higher the perceived heat, but the worse is the area coverage of the infrared radiation. The infrared heater’s radiation should not be blocked by any objects in between. You can safely place your infrared heater on the floor or on the carpet as long as no pets are around.\nLet’s have a look at the 3 best infrared heater placements! I’ve even created images of an example room with different space heater placements for you (although I am not the best at it).\nSo, let’s start!\nWhere to place an infrared heater in a room? Infrared heaters radiate the heat. This means that any object or person in the line of radiation of an infrared heater is heated.\nInfrared heat is not (immediately) distributed through the air. Therefore, you should place an infrared heater to directly heat the area you want to be heated.\nIdeally, you should place your infrared heater in a way that it covers either the largest possible area of your room or directly face the people in it.\nHere are the 3 best infrared heater placements (ranked by area coverage). But actually, the placement on rank #3 provides the highest perceived heat!\n#1 In a corner facing into the room The most common infrared heater placement is a corner with the heater rotated so it faces into the room.\nThis minimizes the space your heater uses up in the room (a corner-placed heater doesn’t bother anyone).\nAlso, a corner placement maximizes the area covered by the heat radiation, assuming that the heater does not distribute its rays over an angle larger than 90° (the angle of walls in a room’s corner).\nAnyways, let’s have a look at how much area a corner infrared heater placement would cover:\nInfrared heater placed in corner facing into the room: Large area coverage, but relatively unfocused heat\nAs you can see, when an infrared heater is placed in a corner, the infrared radiation covers a large part of the room.\nAlso, assuming the bottom rectangle is a sofa, we can see that the radiation reaches the people sitting inside the room.\nA big advantage of the corner placement is that all people present at the opposite two walls are covered by heat radiation.\n#2 At a wall’s center facing into the room If your corners are already occupied by furniture you have no other choice than to place your infrared heater at the center of a wall and heat from there.\nHere’s an image of how that would look like:\nInfrared heater placement at the center of a wall facing into the room: Large area coverage, but heat reaches people at a steep angle (90° in the example)\nAs you see, all the radiation reaches the furniture and people in the room from a 90° angle. This is very bad efficiency-wise because you feel the warmest when heat radiation shines at you right from the front (which would be a 0° angle).\nI’d say you should only place an infrared heater like this if you have no other choice.\nThe area coverage of this placement is still very good.\n#3 Right in front of people The most efficient infrared heater placement is immediately in front of people. This maximizes the density of the infrared rays (as they are not dispersed throughout the room) which increases the heat each person feels.\nThe right-in-front-of-people-placement is far superior to the other placements when you look at the perceived heat only.\nHowever, it impacts the distribution of the heat within the room. A small area is very warm, while a large part of the room remains mostly unheated.\nOf course, the heat will reach other parts of the room eventually. But it will take time.\nPlace your infrared heater right in front of people whenever you need quick and intense heat.\nHere’s an image of what the right-in-front-of-people-placement looks like:\nInfrared heater placement right in front of people: High heat exposure, but low area coverage (which is not necessarily bad)\nAs you can see, most of the room remains uncovered by the radiation. But a small area (in this case the sofa) gets all of the heat radiation.\nIn the example room from the image, I had to move the small table out of the way so that the heater covers the entire sofa.\nIn real life, you can do that as well.\nThe purpose of the right-in-front-of-people placement is to get the maximum amount of heat radiation to shine directly at the people in your room.\nNow that we looked at different infrared heater placements in your room, let’s have a look at the surfaces, elevation levels, and other fine-grained details:\nCan you place an infrared heater on the floor? The best and safest place to install your infrared heater is the floor of your room. By placing your heater on the floor, the radiation shines directly at you (if no other object is in the way).\nMost portable infrared heaters are designed to run standing on the floor.\nIn the case of an infrared heating panel, you will need an additional stand or a foot to install it on the floor.\nCan you place an infrared heater on carpet? Yes, placing an infrared heater on carpet is perfectly safe ! As long as your heater faces away from the floor, there is no risk of fire, since all carpets have an ignition temperature well above what infrared heaters can produce.\nPermanent exposure to radiation might discolor a carpet or dry it out and make it brittle.\nHowever, I’d say that is only the case if too much infrared radiation shines toward the carpet.\nAlmost all infrared heaters are designed to tilt their radiation output slightly upward.\nAlways place your infrared heater facing away from windows You can place the infrared heater in front of the window, but make sure to face your heater into the room and never towards of the window.\nIn general, infrared radiation is not able to penetrate glass. I\u0026rsquo;ve even verified this in an experiment where I used a laser thermometer to measure my hand\u0026rsquo;s temperature.\nThen, I put my hand behind glass and tried measuring again. And the temperature dropped!\nThis means that glass blocks infrared radiation.\nHowever, 100% blockage is not possible, as some wavelengths will be able to pass through the glass to a certain degree.\nSo, even if windows insulate infrared radiation, you should still prefer facing your infrared heater towards a wall (behind you) instead of a window (behind you) if you have the choice.\nProperly setting a heater to not radiate heat out of the window directly affects the heating efficiency.\nCan you place an infrared heater on furniture? Yes, you can place an infrared heater on your furniture. But you must consider a few things before putting your space heater on the furniture.\nThe surface should be hard and well-mounted, so your infrared heater can’t tip over and break Of course, the heater should radiate heat away from the furniture and into the room (not the other way around) Where NOT to place an infrared heater I\u0026rsquo;m going to point out a few places where it\u0026rsquo;s not suitable to place an infrared heater. Avoid placing your heater in these places and prevent any hazards:\nDon’t place it: In a spot accessible to pets Infrared heaters are commonly used in shelter homes and zoos for keeping pets warm.\nBut not every infrared heater is safe for your pet. Some infrared heaters become too hot, and your curious pet may harm itself by touching the heater.\n( I’ve seen images of cats catching fire from infrared heaters … )\nPlace it in a spot inaccessible to pets and use the heater for a limited period to prevent injuries.\nDon’t place it: Facing towards a wall If you place your infrared heater facing the wall, it becomes useless, as it will not serve its purpose.\nThe heater will transfer heat radiation to the wall. Of course, some of the radiation will reflect and radiate into the room. But most of the heat will be wasted.\nDon’t place it: Facing toward electronics Even though placing an infrared heater facing the electronic devices isn\u0026rsquo;t too dangerous; still, it\u0026rsquo;s not a good practice.\nThere is a possibility that your electronic devices may malfunction if they are permanently exposed to heat radiation.\nSo, don\u0026rsquo;t face the infrared heater toward electronic devices, such as your TV or a computer.\nLikely, nothing will happen. But unnecessarily overheating electronic devices is a bad thing to do since electronics run best at low temperatures.\n( That’s why computers have built-in fans and TVs oftentimes have air vents on the back )\nConclusion The location of your heater is significant because it can help heat your room properly, or it might result in a waste of energy.\nThe best place to place your infrared heater is in a room facing the people and covering a broad area.\nYou can place your infrared heater on any hard surface (floor, furniture, or carpeted floor), but place it facing into the room.\nYou can even build your own infrared heater pedestal so that it covers even more parts of your room.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/where-to-place-an-infrared-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhat’s the best place to put your space heater?

(3 Example Placements)"},{"content":"Can you use a space heater as a heat source for your sauna? Yes! In this article, I am going to tell you exactly what you have to do and what you should consider.\nQuick answer: Yes, you can use space heaters to heat a sauna. However, you either have to use two electric space heaters without built-in thermostats simultaneously or one propane gas heater for heating. Adding insulation to your sauna helps increase to raise the possible maximum temperature.\nLet’s first see how much heat a sauna needs and whether we can get that heat from regular space heaters. Later we’ll check which space heaters are suitable for heating a sauna.\nHow much heat do saunas need? To get a sauna up to temperature, you need at least 2,500W of heating power. Now, for very small one-person saunas, you might need less, but let’s focus on saunas for 2 or more people.\nA sauna needs to be heated to around 180°F. Here’s how much heating power you need to get your sauna to that level:\nSauna Size****Required heatSmall (2 - 3 people)2,500WMedium (4 - 5 people)3,500WLarge (5+ people)4,500W\nWhat are the limitations of using a space heater for a sauna? So, before we look at the steps to heat your sauna using space heaters, let’s have a look at some limitations. Based on these, we will figure out how to heat a sauna properly.\n#1 Limitation: Space heater power consumption The first limitation is that most electric space heaters in the US produce a maximum of 1,500W of power.\nThat’s below the required heating powers from the table. So, you can’t expect to heat a decently sized sauna with just one electric space heater.\n#2 Limitation: Household electric circuit power capacity The second limitation is that US household circuit breakers will trip at either 15 Amps or 20 Amps.\nWith a voltage of 120V, the maximum power consumption of a household circuit is\n15A × 120V = 1800W\nor\n20A × 120V = 2400W\nSo, most space heaters are designed to run on 1,500W maximum power to ensure that they never trip a circuit breaker or blow a fuse.\nIn European and UK households, you can draw a lot more! There, the wall outlet voltage is 230V, causing the maximum power consumption to be\n15A × 230V = 3450W\nor\n20A × 230V = 4600W\nThis means:\nIn the US, you can’t run two electric space heaters on full power settings at once . So, you can’t use electric space heaters to heat a sauna. In Europe and in the UK, you can.\n#3 Limitation: Space heaters cut off heating The third limitation is that most electric space heaters have a built-in thermostat. The thermostat is actually a good thing.\nWhen used in a regular room heating setting, the thermostat ensures that the space heater heats your room to the set temperature and it won’t overheat.\nHowever, in a sauna, you want your space heater to not cut-off heating anywhere below sauna temperature.\nWe can conclude:\nTo heat a sauna using a space heater you need a heater that does not have a built-in thermostat and does not cut off the heating. Also, you need a heater that does not overload your home’s electric circuit.\nWhich space heater can you use for a sauna? As we’ve learned from the previous section, for heating a sauna, your home’s electric grid overloads if you attach two space heaters simultaneously. Also, most electric space heaters have a built-in thermostat.\nTherefore, electric space heaters are not an option for heating a sauna. You can use an electric space heater in combination with another non-electric space heater or sauna heater to reduce the sauna’s heat-up time.\nElectric space heaters are only suitable for supplementary heat.\nTo heat a sauna, you should get a propane heater.\nPropane heaters do not cut off the heating at a certain temperature as they don’t have a built-in thermostat.\nAlso, propane heaters can output much more heat than any regular electric space heater.\nA propane heater that outputs 18,000 BTU of power produces heat equivalent to 5,274W.\n( One BTU equals 0.293W )\nThis means one propane heater produces more heat than three regular 1,500W electric space heaters.\nRecommended propane heater for sauna For heating a 2-5 person sauna, I recommend this Mr. Heater Big Buddy (click here to see my review).\nThis model provides 18,000 BTU of heating power, which is enough for most regular-sized home saunas.\nThere are even stronger propane heaters, but these are usually tank-top mounted, so they are not suitable for usage in a sauna.\nThis recommended model can be hooked up to a propane tank via a hose that you can run through your sauna’s walls.\nFor heating large 6+ person saunas, I recommend getting two of those heaters.\nHow to heat a sauna using a propane heater To heat your sauna using a propane heater, you should do the following things:\n#1 Setup the heater through the sauna’s walls When using a propane heater, the propane tank should ideally stay at room temperature.\nYou should never place a propane tank in a sauna.\nTo do that, place your propane heater inside the sauna, and use a hose to connect the heater to the propane tank.\nWith most saunas, that’s pretty simple to do since they have pre-drilled air vents in which you can put the hose.\n#2 Insulate your sauna well Space heaters don’t provide as much heat as a fully-sized sauna stove. So, you should insulate the walls of your sauna well.\nYou can, for example, add an additional layer of styrofoam to the sauna’s roof.\nJust make sure that any flammable insulation material is not exposed to your propane space heater’s burning-hot heating elements.\n#3 Build a heat reflector Propane heaters are usually very directional. If you place your propane heater on the floor, then it will radiate a lot of heat toward your feet, which you probably don’t want.\nYou can build a heat-reflector construction made of aluminum (or other metal) sheets, which you place in front of your propane heater. The construction should reflect the heat toward your sauna guest’s bodies.\nJust make sure that your construction does not overheat your propane heater by reflecting heat back at the heater.\nHow to use an electric space heater for a sauna? You can’t use most electric space heaters for a sauna, because they provide too little heat.\nHowever, if you don’t like too hot saunas and prefer temperatures around 140°F, then you can use your electric space heater for that.\nYou will need a small 1-3 person sauna and run your space heater at full power inside. It should be a space heater that does not cut off temperature using a thermostat.\nUnfortunately, it’s very hard to find these “insecure” space heaters.\nYou might have a good chance of finding old, used models with lower safety standards on eBay.\nBut in general, I don’t recommend using electric space heaters for saunas. Electric space heaters are just not designed to power a sauna, even if it’s a small one.\nCan you speed up sauna heating using electric space heaters? Yes, you can speed up your sauna’s heat-up time using a space heater. However, above 100°F electric space heaters won’t heat due to their built-in thermostat.\nAdditionally, you will have to remove your space heater when your sauna gets too hot to protect it from damage.\nSaunas take a long time to heat up. A large part of the heat-up time is consumed to raise the temperature of the solid objects in your sauna, e.g. the wood, the insulation, and any metal or glass parts.\nThe air in your sauna only takes little time to heat up.\nSo, to speed up your sauna heat-up time, you can use a space heater. The space heater will increase total heating power working on heating the sauna up.\nAdditionally, if you have an infrared heater or a blowing heater (or any kind of heater that directs the heat), you can point it at the largest, most massive object in your sauna.\nThe largest objects are usually the things determining the general heat-up time of your sauna.\nI think using an electric space heater to speed up your sauna’s heat-up time introduces too much hassle.\nYou will have to set it up in addition to your sauna heater, you have to remember to remove your space heater in time, and likely, it won’t change the heat-up time of your sauna that much.\nSo, it’s not worth it.\nConclusion To heat a sauna using a space heater, you should use a propane heater. Propane heaters work independently of your home’s electric grid and provide much more heat than regular electric heaters.\nIf you live in the UK or Europe, you can also use two electric space heaters simultaneously, as UK and European electric circuits support more power than in the US.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-use-a-space-heater-for-a-sauna/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you use a space heater as a heat source for your sauna?

In this article, we’re going to check if a heat pump will dehumidify your room’s air (Spoiler: They don’t, but the air feels dryer).\nAnd then, we’re going to check how you can keep your room’s humidity at a comfortable level.\nQuick answer: No, heat pumps do not dry the air. Instead, they reduce the air\u0026rsquo;s relative humidity, making it feel dryer. This phenomenon is typical to all heaters and not specific to heat pumps. The reduced relative humidity is what you perceive as dry air. In case you prefer humid air, you will need a humidifier.\nSo, let’s unravel all your heat pump \u0026amp; humidity questions one by one! After reading this article, you will understand why heat pumps don’t remove water from the air, but still make you feel dry.\nAnd I will tell you what you can do about it!\nLet’s start:\nDo heat pumps take moisture out of the air? No, heat pumps don’t remove any moisture from the air. A heat pump merely increases your room’s temperature. It does not actively remove water from the air.\nHowever, heat pumps increase your room’s temperature. And the increased temperature can make you feel as if the air is dryer.\nThe reason is that warm air has a higher water-holding capacity. The chart below shows the moisture-holding capacity of air for varying temperatures.\n( source)\nAs you can see, air can hold a seemingly exponentially growing amount of water with increasing temperature.\nThe higher this water holding capacity is, and the higher the temperature in your room is, the more water inside your room evaporates.\nThe water evaporating comes from plants, the room’s walls, your body, or condensation droplets on the windows.\nSo, actually, with increasing temperature, the amount of water in your room’s air increases.\nBut because the humidity is wicked away from your body, you feel as if the air was dry.\nAnd indeed, the relative humidity of the air decreases with increasing temperature.\nThe relative humidity of air is the amount of water in the air in comparison with the amount of water than can be held by the air.\nBecause hot air can hold a lot of water, the relative humidity of the air increases.\nSo, while the absolute humidity of your room’s air is equal or increases (because of evaporating water from your room), the relative humidity decreases.\nThe physics of dehumidifying a room Imagine a closed room. The room is perfectly sealed. Inside the room, there’s air with moisture. None of the air can ever escape the room.\nIn the room, there is only one object which is a heat source. Right now the room is cold and humid.\nWhat happens when we turn the heater on?\nThe temperature rises. But since the room is perfectly sealed, nothing else happens. The room still contains the very same amount of humidity and air.\nA heat source never removes humidity from the air. To remove humidity, you will have to vent the room.\nWhy do air conditioners remove moisture but heat pumps don’t? Heat pumps are very similar to air conditioners. Basically, they are like air conditioners but reversed.\nInstead of using extracting heat from your room and blowing it outdoors, heat pumps extract heat from the outdoor air and blow it indoors.\nSo, why do air conditioners remove moisture from the air, but heat pumps don’t?\nHere’s why:\nDuring an air conditioner’s cooling process, the air conditioner absorbs humidity from the air. The humidity condensates to droplets and is collected in a water tank or drained immediately.\nIf you don’t drain your air conditioner, then the water will not leave your room. This means: An air conditioner does not absorb water from your room.\nThat’s a very common misunderstanding!\nAn air conditioner only condensates the water in your room. So, all an air conditioner does is change the physical state of the water from gaseous to liquid.\nThe draining of the air conditioner is what actually removes the humidity from your room!\nApplying the principles to heat pumps If we apply these realizations to heat pumps, then we get the following conclusion:\nA heat pump changes the state of water from gaseous to liquid. But since it’s a reverse air conditioner, the state change will happen outdoors. This means that a heat pump does not do anything with indoor air. A heat pump does not have an indoor drain. Heat pumps only carry heat indoors (through convection, or another medium). So, there is no way humidity will leave your room. Heat pumps do not absorb water as air conditioners do. They don’t have a water tank filling up. And you will never have to drain water from a heat pump.\nWill a heat pump get rid of condensation? Heat pumps generally reduce the amount of condensation in your home. Heated air absorbs more humidity than cold air. Therefore, any kind of heater, whether powered through a heat pump or not will achieve a condensation decrease.\nAfter installing a heat pump you can only expect a change in your current humidity situation if you run your heat pump on higher temperature settings.\nIf you are currently running an electric, gas, or oil-powered classic heating system, then a heat pump will not reduce the condensation if you run it on the same temperature settings as your previous heating system.\nHowever, if you increase the temperature of your heat pump, it will reduce the condensation.\nHeat pumps are very power-efficient, so it’s inviting to run them on higher temperature settings.\nDo you need a humidifier with a heat pump? Most people do not need a humidifier to run along a heat pump. However, if you prefer humid air or you have health issues (dry skin, breathing problems, etc.), then you should get a simple humidifier.\nRecommended Humidifier I always recommend simple and solid products. For humidifying, I would pick this humidifier(click here to view it on amazon).\nBut actually, it does not really matter which exact humidifier you end up buying. All humidifiers are technically the same and they only differ in quality and design.\nSo, pick one that suits your preferences!\nConclusion The way heat pumps (and heaters in general) increase the amount of water floating around in the air while actually making you feel drier is a bit confusing at first.\nI hope this article clarified your questions!\nIf you are sensitive to dry air, then I highly recommend getting a humidifier!\nEspecially in the cold wintertime, when your heat pump is running on higher power settings, the air will feel dry.

You’ll find all cooling capacities between 8,000 BTU and 14,000 BTU.\nFor each quiet portable air conditioner, I’ll also list the room size each model is good for!\nQuick answer: The quietest portable air conditioner is a 47dB TOSOT unit. After that, most quiet air conditioners are rated either 51dB or 52dB. An average portable air conditioner is 56dB, which is significantly more because each 3dB increase doubles the perceived noise volume.\nHere’s the full list of the quietest portable air conditioners. After deciding for a model, I highly recommend to keep reading.\nI will tell you how to make your portable air conditioner even quieter than the manufacturer’s specification with a few simple tweaks!\nRecommended Products: Quietest Single-Hose and Dual-Hose ACs Single-hose ACs are a bit easier to setup and a bit more affordable, while dual-hose ACs will provide better cooling.\nIn general, you should pick the dual-hose AC over the single-hose AC!\nQuietest Single-hose portable AC (51dB) Of all the quiet air conditioners ranked and listed below, I recommend getting this BLACK+DECKER AC (click to view it on amazon).\nThis one is only the second most quiet portable air conditioner from the list below. However, I trust the BLACK+DECKER brand a lot more than TOSOT (the number #1 ranked AC) to specify accurate noise levels on their sales page and I strongly assume this one is the better air conditioner.\nBLACK+DECKER is a good brand and they are proven to work reliably.\nQuietest Dual-hose portable AC (52dB) If you are looking to get a quiet, but very powerful air conditioner, then get this Whynter ARC-122DS air conditione r (click here to view it on amazon).\nWith 52dB it’s just 1dB “louder” than the previous model. So, the noise difference is barely noticeable.\nIt’s a dual-hose portable air conditioner which makes it a lot more efficient than regular single-hose air conditioners.\nBecause of its increased efficiency, it outputs more cold air (12,000 BTU) while still running quietly.\nThose two air conditioners are my personal recommendations. But keep reading to see the full list of quiet portable air conditioners and their specifications (e.g. room sizes and noise levels):\n5 Quietest Portable Air Conditioners (Ranking) All of the portable air conditioners in this list are very quiet. So, instead of going straight for the quietest air conditioner, you should also consider your room size.\nFor each air conditioner, I’ll list the corresponding room size it is suitable for.\n#1 TOSOT portable AC (47dB) The quietest portable air conditioner is this TOSOT portable air conditioner (click to view it on amazon).\nNoise level: 47dB Cooling capacity: 8,000 BTU Room size: 150 sq. ft. - 250 sq. ft. With just 47dB, this portable AC is incredibly quiet. If the manufacturer’s specification is accurate, then you can expect this to be only half as loud as the next air conditioner.\nEach 3dB decrease is a halving in perceived noise levels.\nSo, if you are looking for the absolute quietest portable air conditioner, then you can stop here and get this TOSOT portable air conditioner.\nHowever, I find the power consumption of 1,050 a bit too high for only 8,000 BTU of cooling capacity. That’s about 10% higher than other comparable air conditioners.\nSo, according to the manufacturer, it’s a quiet AC, but uses more power… Something is off here.\nAnd that’s why I personally would not buy this portable AC and opt for the next-ranked AC instead.\n#2 BLACK+DECKER portable AC (51dB) The second quietest portable AC is this BLACK+DECKER AC (click to view it on amazon).\nNoise level: 51dB Cooling capacity: 8,000 BTU Room size: 150 sq. ft. - 250 sq. ft. With a 51dB noise level, it is still significantly quieter than other portable air conditioners. However, the big gap between the #1 model, which is 47dB and this AC makes me suspicious.\nAll air conditioners produce noise. So, one portable AC outperforming all other ACs by 4dB (which is a lot) is very unlikely.\nPersonally, I trust BLACK+DECKER significantly more than TOSOT and I think a rating of 51dB is more realistic than 47dB.\nAnd that’s why I would recommend getting the tried and trusted BLACK+DECKER AC instead of the other most quiet AC, which might turn out to be a lemon…\n#3 SereneLife SLPAC10 (52dB) Another silent portable AC is this SereneLife SLPAC10 air conditioner (click here to view it on amazon)\nNoise level: 52dB Cooling capacity: 10,000 BTU Room size: 200 sq. ft. - 300 sq. ft. The SereneLife portable air conditioner provides more cooling power than the previous quiet portable air conditioners.\nThis AC unit is well-suited for larger rooms. You can also choose other cooling capacities for this AC.\nOne thing is very curious. The specifications for the 10,000 BTU model (which I recommend here) state that the noise level is only 52dB.\nThe same AC, but with 8,000 BTU cooling capacity, has noise levels of 55dB to 57dB. Something is off here… Either the 8,000 BTU model is manufactured more cheaply, or the specification is wrong.\nBecause intuitively a small air conditioner should be quieter than a stronger one. But who knows?\nSereneLife is a good company. Their air conditioners have tens of thousands of positive ratings only, so I trust them.\nI included this portable air conditioner in this list because this model is the quietest 10,000 BTU portable air conditioner I could find!\n#4 Whynter ARC-122DS (52dB) Another quiet portable AC is this Whynter ARC-122DS air conditione r (click here to view it on amazon).\nNoise level: 52dB Cooling capacity: 12,000 BTU Room size: 250 sq. ft. - 350 sq. ft. And actually, I’d say if I had to get one to cool a medium to large space, then this portable air conditioner is your best choice.\nIt is a dual-hose portable air conditioner. Dual-hose units are technically superior to single-hose models because they are a lot more efficient.\nIf you are looking to get the most cooling for the least cost, then this portable air conditioner is for you.\nYou should always prefer a dual-hose model over single-hose models. Some single-hose portable air conditioners are a bit quieter than this dual-hose model.\nBut the difference of just 1dB does not justify the cooling efficiency difference.\nDual-hose air conditioners cool just as well as real window or split air conditioners. They don’t have the drawbacks most other (single-hose) portable air conditioners have.\nIf you want a quiet, powerful, and energy-efficient portable AC, then you should get this Whynter AC.\n#5 DeLonghi Pinguino (52dB) The strongest quiet portable air conditioner is this DeLonghi Pinguino AC (click here to view it on amazon)\nNoise level: 52dB Cooling capacity: 14,000 BTU Room size: 300 sq. ft. - 400 sq. ft. This model has the highest cooling capacity of all quiet portable air conditioners. So, if you are looking to cool large spaces, or multiple rooms at once, then this AC unit is for you.\nWith noise levels of 52dB it is very quiet, which is surprising given the high cooling capacity of 14,000 BTU.\nHowever, because it’s a single-hose model and it has such a high cooling capacity you can expect it to have a higher running cost than the other models in this list.\nHow noisy are portable air conditioners? Portable air conditioners have a noise level of about 56dB on average. Noise level and cooling capacity do not correlate strongly.\nThis means that there are quiet, but strong portable air conditioners (such as the ones in this list), and there can also be loud, but weak air conditioners.\nThe noise level of a portable air conditioner depends mostly on the compressor quality, the general build quality, and the temperature settings.\nHow can you make a portable AC more quiet? The quiet portable air conditioners are not quiet enough for you? By following the below-listed tips you will be able to cut down your portable air conditioner’s average noise levels by an additional 3dB.\nFacts for geeks: A 3dB decrease is a halving of the noise level (because decibels are a logarithmic scale). Accordingly, a 3dB increase would double the noise volume.\nYou can make your portable AC quiet by insulating it properly and placing it on an anti-vibration pad. Also, you can reduce the fan settings.\nInsulate your portable air conditioner Insulate your portable air conditioner to make it quieter. An insulated air conditioner needs fewer cooling cycles, which means it will produce less noise.\nTo insulate a portable air conditioner, the first best thing to do is to wrap the exhaust hose in an insulating aluminum wrap. This prevents heat from reentering the room through the poorly insulated plastic hose.\nAlso, you should ensure that the window setup of your portable air conditioner is fully sealed. There should be as little hot air leaking into the room as possible.\nI know it’s not possible to perfectly set up the window kit, because they are one-size-fits-all.\nHowever, the better you set up your portable air conditioner, the less cooling cycles it will need and the quieter it will be.\nFor more portable air conditioner efficiency tips, read “How to make a portable air conditioner more efficient?”.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a Whynter portable AC with added hose insulation, which improves quietness and energy-efficiency!\nPlace the AC unit on an anti-vibration pad An anti-vibration pad is a thick, noise-insulating pad that you can place large appliances on.\nUsually, they are used for dishwashers or washing machines. But you can use them for portable air conditioners just as well.\nAnti-vibration pads reduce the vibration going into the floor. Therefore, they are very good to dampen the noise exposure of neighbors and rooms nearby.\nYou will still be able to heat your portable air conditioner just as before. But any neighboring rooms will heat a lot less of your air conditioner’s noise.\nAlso, when you are sleeping with a running portable air conditioner, anti-vibration pads help a lot. Because less noise is moving through the floor, less noise reaches you lying in bed.\nPersonally, I get very noise-sensitive while sleeping to any noise that is carried through the floor, such as neighbor’s walking, or portable air conditioners running.\nAnti-vibration pads are worth gold in this case!\nReduce fan settings Another way to reduce your quiet portable air conditioner’s noise even further is to simply reduce the fan settings.\nAll air conditioners have a built-in fan to distribute the cold air. Aside from the compressor, the fan is the second source of AC noise.\nIt’s very easy to fix this:\nJust reduce your fan settings.\nRead “How to make a portable air conditioner quiet?” for more tips!\nAre quiet portable ACs better than noisy ones? Quiet portable air conditioners are not necessarily better than noisy ones. The noise level of a portable air conditioner does not correlate strongly with its power consumption or its cooling capacity.\nThis means that it is possible to get a quiet air conditioner that is very inefficient and accordingly causes high electricity costs without providing the cooling you need.\nThat would, however, be the exception. All of the air conditioners listed in this article are efficient and silent.\nIn general, portable air conditioner noise levels (or quietness) in combination with a high cooling capacity is an indicator of good build quality.\nIf a portable air conditioner can produce a lot of cold air while remaining quiet, that is a sign of good engineering and solid manufacturing.\nYou can assume that the materials used are of high quality. Or… at least the internals of the portable AC, since almost all AC casings are made of plastic.\nAnd also, it’s a sign of low-tolerance manufacturing, where parts are built to work together well.\nIf you compare two portable air conditioners with the same specifications (cooling capacity, power consumption, etc.) but different noise levels, then you should always get the quieter model.\nConclusion Portable air conditioners can get as quiet as 47dB.\nHowever, portable air conditioners usually have efficiency issues. If you are not only looking for the quietest portable air conditioner possible, but you also want efficiency, I highly recommend checking out window air conditioners.\nWindow air conditioners can be as quiet as portable air conditioners, but they consume a lot less electricity than portable air conditioners because of their higher efficiency.\nAn in-between solution is a dual-hose portable air conditioner.\nDual-hose portable air conditioners are almost as efficient as window air conditioners, but you get all the advantages of a portable air conditioner.\nIn the list above, you’ll find one dual-hose model! This one is a great balance between quiet, efficient, and cost-effective.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/quietest-portable-air-conditioners/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHere are the 5 quietest portable air conditioners between 47dB and 52dB.

A dual-hose unit is perfect for larger spaces because it can cool an area more quickly and efficiently than a single-hose AC.\nHowever, numerous other factors differentiate single-hose and dual-hose ACs, including price, features, portability, compatibility with other appliances, and ease of use.\nIn this article, I\u0026rsquo;ll explain what single-hose and dual-hose portable air conditioners are. I will also compare the two types of ACs and give you my verdict on which is better.\nRead on to find out!\nComparison: Single vs Dual Hose Portable Air Conditioners FactorSingle-Hose Portable UnitDual-Hose Portable Unit****PriceAffordable Slightly more expensiveCooling EfficiencyBadGoodMaintenanceEasyEasyInstallationSimpleSimpleRecommended ProductBLACK+DECKER single-hose AC (click to view it on amazon)Whynter dual-hose AC (click to view it on amazon)This table shows the differences between single-hose and dual-hose portable air conditioners.\nThe two main types of portable air conditioners are single-hose and dual-hose units. Both have their pros and cons, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to choose the right one for your needs.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for an efficient way to cool your room, garage, or office, then a dual hose unit may be just what you need. They offer superior performance as compared to single-hose air conditioners.\nSingle-hose portable air conditioners are less expensive, but they are less effective. Dual hose units cost more, but they cool more effectively and can also help to reduce humidity levels in a room.\nProbably the most popular dual-hose portable AC: The Whynter ARC-14S\nSingle-Hose Portable Air Conditioners Single-hose portable air conditioners have one exhaust hose to expel warm air out of the room. They are the most common type of portable air conditioner because of their easy installation and affordability.\nHow Do Single-Hose Portable Air Conditioners Work? Single-hose portable air conditioners use a single vent to remove the hot and humid air from the room. The hose runs from the AC unit to the window, door, or wall hole.\nSingle-hose portable air conditioners absorb the heat from your room, exhaust the absorbed heat and blow out cooled air.\nHowever, nothing prevents your single-hose portable AC from sucking in the just-cooled air again and blowing it out of the window.\nThis is a major efficiency problem in single-hose portable air conditioner functionality.\nAlso, since the AC unit continuously removes the hot air from the room, the air pressure inside the room drops lower than the atmospheric pressure outside, which results in a negative pressure gradient.\nAs a result, the hot outside air has to move inside the room to balance that negative pressure gradient. However, it\u0026rsquo;s not pulled directly through the unit. Instead, it sneaks in through the cracks and crevices.\nEven if all the windows, vents, and doors are closed, hot air will find its way to come in through very small crevices, floor clearance, and window gaps.\nThis hot air will again increase the room\u0026rsquo;s temperature, which causes a decrease in efficiency and causes the AC to have a higher average power consumption.\nOverall, this single-hose working cycle keeps the unit constantly under pressure. It decreases the unit\u0026rsquo;s efficiency and will add up more energy costs.\nAdvantages of Single-Hose Portable Air Conditioners\n#1 Lower Initial Cost Single-hose portable air conditioners typically have a lower initial cost compared to dual-hose models. The simplified design, which utilizes just one hose for venting hot air, contributes to a reduced cost for parts and materials. Prices can range from around $100 to $400, depending on factors like cooling capacity and overall build quality.\n#2 Simplified Installation In spaces devoid of windows or vents, single-hose units offer a more straightforward installation process. Only one hole needs to be created in the wall to accommodate the hose, thereby minimizing both installation time and potential structural modifications. This can translate into lower installation costs compared to dual-hose units, which would require two holes.\n#3 Easier Maintenance Maintaining a single-hose air conditioner tends to be simpler than its dual-hose counterpart. For example, air filters in single-hose units are often easily accessible from the exterior, facilitating quick and convenient cleaning or replacement. This ease of maintenance can contribute to a longer lifespan for the unit if proper upkeep is observed.\nSingle-hose portable air conditioners are easy to install - but they are less efficient.\nDisadvantages of Single-Hose Portable Air Conditioners #1 Lower Cooling Efficiency Single-hose air conditioners tend to have a lower cooling efficiency compared to their dual-hose counterparts. This is often reflected in their average BTU (British Thermal Unit) ratings, which are typically lower. As a result, these units may take longer to cool a room and may consume more energy in the process.\n#2 Limited Area Coverage Single-hose units are generally less effective for cooling larger spaces. They are best suited for smaller rooms where the heat load is not excessively high. Using a single-hose unit in a large room may result in inadequate cooling and higher energy consumption.\n#3 Negative Air Pressure Issues One of the downsides of using a single-hose unit is that it creates negative air pressure in the room. This can lead to several problems, including pulling in warm, humid air from other parts of the building or from outside. The negative pressure can also exacerbate issues related to moisture and mold build-up within the room.\n#4 Risk of Drawing in Outdoor Pollutants Single-hose units can be particularly problematic if the outdoor air quality is poor. Due to the negative air pressure they create, harmful pollutants like smoke can be drawn into the room. Contrary to what one might expect, typical air filters in these units are not designed to handle such pollutants because the infiltrating air often enters through gaps and crevices in the room, bypassing the unit\u0026rsquo;s filtration system.\nBest Single-Hose Portable Air Conditioner Ideally, your single-hose portable air conditioner should have the following features:\nRemote control: Allows you to easily switch between cooling and conditioning modes without walking across the room. Energy Saving Mode: lowers your AC\u0026rsquo;s power consumption when it is not being used so that it uses less energy overall. This can help you save money on your electricity bill. Timer Function: Allows you to set a predetermined time for the AC to turn off automatically. This is useful if you want the room to be cool before bedtime or in case of some unexpected event that causes extended use beyond your normal limit. My Recommendation: This BLACK+DECKER Air Conditioner (14,000 BTU) (click here to view it on amazon)\nBlack \u0026amp; Decker is known for its durable yet sleek products that are efficient in every way possible.\nWith such a high number of reviews on Amazon, we can\u0026rsquo;t help but say that this AC is great.\nWith a weight of 62.4 pounds, this portable air conditioner has a 14000 BTU cooling capacity, ensuring that you get a comfortable temperature quickly. Its freeze-proof compressor ensures that it works even in the most extreme conditions.\nThe unit comes with an easy-to-use remote control so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fumble around with buttons or try to figure out where they are while keeping your hands free.\nThis air conditioner comes with a 24 hours timer feature which helps regulate the temperature according to your requirement, ensuring maximum comfort and convenience every time you use it! So what are you waiting for?\nDual-Hose Portable Air Conditioners Dual-hose portable air conditioners have two separate hoses: one for intake and one for exhaust. This design helps the unit to cool more effectively than a single-hose unit because it allows the air conditioner to take in cooler air from outside while expelling the warm air from the room.\nThese units are ideal for larger spaces because they can cool an area faster than a regular air conditioning unit. Dual hose units also have better airflow control, which means they can distribute the cooling evenly throughout the room.\nHow Do Dual-Hose Portable Air Conditioners Work? Compared to single-hose, dual-hose portable air conditioners have an extra hose that allows them to suck in outside air and cool it instead of cooling indoor air and blowing it outdoors.\nThe intake hose will pull the air from the outside through the window or the door. The pulled air will run through the condenser, where heat is absorbed.\nThe cooled air is blown into the room, while the extracted heat is blown outside again.\nOnce it passes through, the second hose will expel it back into the environment.\nThis process doesn\u0026rsquo;t create a negative pressure gradient like single-hose air conditioners. This way, the unit won\u0026rsquo;t bring warm outside air into the room.\nAdvantages of Dual-Hose Portable Air Conditioners #1 Faster Cooling Time Dual-hose air conditioning units offer more efficient cooling by having superior airflow control compared to their single-hose counterparts. This allows the cooled air to circulate more quickly and evenly throughout the room, resulting in a more rapid drop in temperature.\n#2 Versatility in Placement Contrary to the notion that dual-hose units require more space, the space requirement is generally comparable to single-hose models. This means dual-hose air conditioners can be effectively utilized in tight or confined spaces without sacrificing performance.\n#3 Elimination of Negative Air Pressure One major advantage of dual-hose air conditioners is that they prevent the creation of negative air pressure in the room. Unlike single-hose models, they do not pull in warm air from the outside, which helps maintain a balanced indoor environment. This is beneficial in mitigating issues like mildew and other humidity-related problems.\n#4 Ease of Maintenance Dual-hose air conditioning units usually come with easily accessible filters and coils that can be cleaned with just water. Regular maintenance not only extends the longevity of the unit but also ensures that the air quality in your home remains free from harmful pollutants and unpleasant odors.\nDisadvantages of Dual-Hose Portable Air Conditioners #1 Higher Initial Cost While dual-hose air conditioners offer enhanced cooling performance, they come with a higher initial cost compared to single-hose units. The increased expense is primarily due to the additional components and materials required for the dual-hose configuration. Additionally, dual-hose models often come with higher cooling capacities, further contributing to their elevated price point.\n#2 Increased Space Requirement for Hoses Though the main unit\u0026rsquo;s size is comparable to single-hose models, dual-hose air conditioners do require slightly more room for hose placement. Since there are two hoses to consider, they take up more window space than a single hose. While the extra space requirement is generally minimal, it is something to consider if you have limited window area.\n#3 Requirement for Dual Vent Openings In cases where there are no existing vents or windows, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create two openings in the wall to accommodate both hoses. This not only demands extra labor but could also involve structural considerations, potentially complicating the installation process.\nBest Dual-Hose Portable Air Conditioner This one is the single-best portable air conditioner. I always recommend dual-hose air conditioners. And the Whynter ARC-14S is the most efficient and most powerful of them all.\nMy Recommendation: This Whynter ARC-14S (14,000 BTU) portable air conditioner (click here to view it on amazon)\nThe Whynter ARC-14S is the best portable air conditioner for your large space requirement (up to 500 square feet). Then there are 3 fan speeds (high, medium, and low) that ensure cooling over a large area quickly and efficiently.\nThe Whynter ARC-14S: Possibly the best portable air conditioner on the market.\nThis award-winning device features an extendable exhaust hose that allows you to easily adjust the airflow, giving you total control over your environment.

So don\u0026rsquo;t miss out on this chance to relax in the comfort and style that Whynter is known for.\nConclusion You should always prefer dual-hose portable air conditioners over single-hose portable air conditioners. Dual-hose air conditioners are a lot more efficient. Even though they cost more initially, their reduced running cost will pay for itself.\nThe choice between dual-hose and single-hose portable air conditioners ultimately depends on your specific needs, room size, and budget constraints.\nDual-hose units offer superior cooling efficiency, balanced indoor air pressure, and reduced risks of drawing in outdoor pollutants. While they come with a higher initial cost, the investment often pays off in the long run through more effective cooling and potentially lower energy bills.\nOn the other hand, single-hose units offer a lower upfront cost and simpler installation, particularly in spaces without existing vents or windows. However, they are generally less efficient and could result in higher energy costs over time, especially if used in larger spaces.\nIn terms of quality and durability, dual-hose units tend to have the edge, thanks to their more complex engineering and greater cooling capacities. However, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t make single-hose units an inferior choice across the board; they can be a suitable option for smaller rooms or for temporary use.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/is-a-single-or-dual-hose-portable-ac-better/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMany people are confused about which type of portable air conditioner to buy.

And additionally, window air conditioners get you the most cooling capacity for the least amount of money.\n#1 BLACK+DECKER Small-Room Window Air Conditioner (5,000 BTU) My personal recommendation is this BLACK+DECKER window air conditioner (click here to view it on amazon).\nI picked this one as the best air conditioner for small rooms because it takes up very little space and you can choose the cooling capacity you need.\nAvailable sizes:\n5,000 BTU 6,000 BTU 8,000 BTU or higher (but that’s too much for small rooms) The smallest model is 5,000 BTU, which is perfect for small rooms and bedrooms. According to the manufacturer it is designed for up to 150 sq. ft. rooms. But I’d personally say 5,000 BTU is enough even for 200 sq. ft. or 250 sq. ft. rooms.\nIf you are unsure about which size to pick, just get the 6,000 BTU model. There’s also an 8,000 BTU option. But that’s way too big for most small rooms. And it’s twice the price!\n#2 LG Window Air Conditioner (6,000 BTU) My second place recommended window air conditioner for small rooms is this 6,000 BTU LG window AC (click here to view it on amazon).\nI rank this one #2 because you have no other options than going for the 6,000 BTU cooling capacity.\nSo, this one might be a bit oversized for very small rooms. Nevertheless, it’s a good window air conditioner and you can’t really go wrong with it.\nI could tell you all kinds of trivia about this window air conditioner, such as its low noise and that it has many settings… But actually, that’s standard nowadays, and most window air conditioners are the same.\nTo be honest, it does not really matter which window AC you get. All of them are technically identical, and they only differ in cooling capacity.\n#3 Midea Window Air Conditioner (5,000 BTU) My third choice would be this Midea window air conditioner (click here to view it on amazon).\nThere’s nothing that technically makes this one worse than the second-placed AC. All window air conditioners are technically the same.\nThis one is just another small 5,000 BTU window air conditioner that is perfectly sized for small rooms. This model also comes in different sizes:\n5,000 BTU 6,000 BTU 8,000 BTU and higher But you don’t really need anything above 6,000 BTU if your room is smaller than 250 square feet.\nAt the end of this article, I am going to tell you the ideal BTU rating for your room size. So, stick out until the end!\n#4 BLACK+DECKER Portable Air Conditioner for Small Rooms (8,000 BTU) The portable air conditioners in this list have more cooling power than the previously listed window air conditioners.\nThis is intentional.\nPortable air conditioners are not as efficient as window air conditioners. So, to get the same amount of cold as a window air conditioner, a portable AC needs a bit more cooling capacity.\nThis BLACK+DECKER portable air conditione r (click here to view it on amazon) is my personal recommendation for small rooms.\nIt’s a great portable air conditioner in general. And the cooling capacity of 8,000 BTU is perfect for most small rooms. The air conditioner’s shape is well-rounded, so bumping into this air conditioner at night won’t hurt too much (yes, that’s a criterion!).\nTechnically, this portable air conditioner is not any better or worse than other well-built portable air conditioners (such as the next two recommendations).\nI ranked this one as the best portable air conditioner for small spaces because it has the perfect cooling capacity, and it has a ton of great ratings! (over 40,000…)\nYou can’t go wrong with this one.\n#5 SereneLife Portable Air Conditioner (8,000 BTU) This SereneLife portable air conditione r (click here to view it on amazon) is my number two recommendation for small-room portable air conditioners.\nThis one works just as well as the previous portable AC. The only difference is really how it looks.\nThe technical details such as cooling capacity, power consumption or energy efficiency are about the same.\nSo, I’d suggest you have a look at both portable ACs and pick the one that you like better based on what suits better into your room.\n#6 Whynter ARC-14S Portable AC (14,000 BTU) The Whynter ARC-14S portable AC (click here to view it on amazon) is my all-time favorite portable air conditioner model.\nEven though the 14,000 BTU are too powerful for small rooms, I just had to include it.\nHere’s why:\nThe Whynter ARC-14S is a dual-hose air conditioner. Instead of one hose that blows air out of the window, this one has two hoses. And this makes a huge difference in terms of energy efficiency.\nDual-hose air conditioners use one hose to blow the extracted heat out of your room, and the other hose is for sucking in outdoor air which is to be cooled and blown into your room.\nA single-hose AC can’t do that. Instead of sucking in outdoor air for cooling, it sucks in your indoor air… And that’s the air you just cooled.\nSo, single-hose ACs cool the air, and then they blow the same cooled air out of your room.\nThat’s why dual-hose portable air conditioners are just so much better.\nI highly recommend getting this model if you have the extra money (it’s slightly more expensive).\nThe increased efficiency will pay off quickly!\nTo adapt the AC to your room’s small size, just lower the temperature settings.\n#7 Hessaire Evaporative Cooler Evaporative coolers are not real air conditioners. Air conditioners always have to blow extracted heat out of your room.\nAn evaporative cooler contains watered sponges and blows air over them. The evaporation absorbs heat and leaves cool air behind which is blown into the room.\nI recommend this Hessaire Evaporative Cooler (click here to view it on amazon). It is powerful enough to cool down small rooms quickly.\nTo refill water, you can either refill manually, or you can connect to a tap or water tank for a continuous refill.\nHow much cooling capacity (in BTU) do small room air conditioners need? A good estimate for most rooms is 20 BTU per square foot. So, here’s how much cooling capacity different small room sizes need:\nRoom size****Cooling capacity100 sq. ft.2,000 BTU150 sq. ft.3,000 BTU200 sq. ft.4,000 BTU250 sq. ft.5,000 BTU300 sq. ft.6,000 BTU\nAll of the air conditioners recommended in this article were either 5,000 BTU or higher. So, you will definitely find one that suits your room size.\nSmall 100 square feet rooms need just 2,000 BTU of cooling capacity. That’s a lot less than even the smallest air conditioners provide.\nIf you have such a small room, you can also think about placing a larger 8,000 BTU air conditioner in the neighboring room and just leaving the door open.\nThis increases the effective to-be-cooled area and then you don’t have to worry about getting a small air conditioner specifically for your very small room.\nWhich air conditioner type is best for small rooms? My personal favorite AC type are window air conditioners. But portable air conditioners are fine as well. Here’s why.\nWindow air conditioners The best air conditioner type for small rooms is a window air conditioner. Window air conditioners are very efficient and they don’t take up any floor space in your small room since they are window-mounted.\nInterestingly, window air conditioners come with even smaller cooling power (BTU) ratings than portable air conditioners.\nThe reason is probably that window air conditioners cool more efficiently and, therefore, can create a good cooling effect even with lower cooling capacity ratings.\nPortable air conditioners Portable air conditioners are also good for small rooms. However, they will consume more electricity than window air conditioners due to their bad efficiency.\nI recommend getting a portable air conditioner over a window air conditioner only if you plan to use your portable air conditioner in other rooms as well.\nIn this case, portable air conditioners are easy to move around the house and they are great for portable cooling.\nIn small rooms, portable air conditioners will take up the floor space in front of your window. So, before buying one, check that you have enough space available.\nEvaporative coolers In general, I don’t recommend evaporative coolers. They are very energy efficient, but they are just not real air conditioners and you will always have to refill them. Also, you will have to deal with damp air and regularly vent your room.\nThe damp air is what makes you feel cooler since damp air sucks away heat from your body. So, evaporative coolers are (partially) not real cooling but just perceived cooling.\nThe only real advantage of evaporative coolers over air conditioners is that they don’t need any installation.\nYou don’t need to mount them to your window. You can just run them whenever you want.\nSo, they are more portable than portable air conditioners.\nShould you get a small or a big air conditioner for your small room? Air conditioning a small room does not always make sense. While it keeps your air conditioner’s running cost low (because your AC has to cool only one small room), you will have to buy an entire air conditioner just to cover a small space.\nThe long-term running cost of small air conditioners is low, but the initial purchase is very high when you consider the small space you want to cover.\nIn general, larger air conditioners are not much more expensive than smaller ones. Getting a 10,000 BTU (or higher) model won’t cost you double what a 5,000 BTU AC costs.\nSo, the price per BTU is higher for small ACs.\nInstead of air conditioning your small room only, you can get a larger air conditioner and cool the neighboring rooms and leave the door open. This leaves you with a fully air-conditioned living space while paying a similar initial price for the larger AC model.\nOf course, this does not apply to everyone. If you are living in a one-room apartment or you live with roommates, then you usually don’t have any other choice than getting an air conditioner for your small room.\nWhy you should cool larger spaces instead (Mathematically explained) You can’t really cool a small room effectively. The reason is the surface-area-to-volume ratio of small rooms.\nThe volume of a room determines the amount of cold air it can hold. The surface area of a room determines how much heat enters it.\nSmall rooms have small volumes. But this causes an interesting mathematical effect. A small room’s surface area (made up of walls, ceiling, and floor), is comparatively very large when compared to its volume.\nIn contrast, a larger room has a lower surface area to volume ratio.\nLet’s consider different square rooms (for ease of computation) with a ceiling height of 9 feet and check their volumes and surface-area-to-volume ratio:\nFloor area (in square feet)****Surface area of ceiling, walls and floor (in square feet)****Room volume (in cubic feet)****Surface-area-to-volume ratio100 sq. ft.560.00 sq. ft.900 cft0.622222150 sq. ft.740.91 sq. ft.1350 cft0.548821200 sq. ft.909.12 sq. ft.1800 cft0.505065250 sq. ft.1069.21 sq. ft.2250 cft0.475204300 sq. ft.1223.54 sq. ft.2700 cft0.453162350 sq. ft.1373.50 sq. ft.3150 cft0.436031400 sq. ft.1520.00 sq. ft.3600 cft0.422222450 sq. ft.1663.68 sq. ft.4050 cft0.410784500 sq. ft.1804.98 sq. ft.4500 cft0.401108\nAs you can see in the table, small rooms have a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio than large rooms.\nThis means in a small room there is only a little volume of air to cool, but a lot of surface area through which heat can enter your room.\nThis means to keep a small room cool, you have to continuously run air conditioning. Because a relatively large amount of heat is constantly entering your room through the walls.\nThis makes all non-air conditioning cooling methods obsolete. Venting your room, for example, will only cause your room to heat up quickly again.\nThe mathematics of surface-to-volume ratio are a strong indicator that cooling larger spaces and keeping doors open is much more cost-effective than cooling just the small room you’re in.\nHere’s a list of the most powerful air conditioners (for larger rooms) in case I convinced you.\nConclusion Here’s some decision help for you:\nIf you want to cool your small room cost-effectively, then get a window air conditioner.\nWindow air conditioners are too hard to set up for you or you want to be able to move your air conditioner around the house? Then, get a portable air conditioner.\nOnly ever get an evaporative cooler if you really can’t install anything to your window. Evaporative coolers are a trade-off and won’t work as well as real air conditioners.\nIn case your small room connects to a larger room that you spend your time in as well, get a larger window or portable AC and cool the large room instead. Large rooms can hold the cold a lot better than cold rooms due to their lower surface-area-to-volume ratio.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-air-conditioners-for-small-rooms/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAir conditioners for small rooms should not take up much space, effectively cool your room, and don’t consume much electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we’re going to check the best air conditioners for small rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick answer: \u003cstrong\u003eThe best air conditioner for small rooms is a 5,000 BTU window air conditioner.

Or does it consume too much firewood?\nQuick answer: To improve your wood stove’s efficiency, use a firewood holder, use properly dried wood, and keep the chimney and the airways clean. Additionally, you can install a wood stove insert or a reflective wall heat shield.\nHow to improve wood stove efficiency (13 Methods) Here’s a full list of all the ways to improve your wood stove’s efficiency.\n#1 Use a firewood holder One reason your wood stove’s efficiency lacks can be that your firewood does not get enough oxygen. You can fix this using this wood stove firewood holder (click here to view it on amazon).\n( Just make sure it fits your wood stove’s dimensions before buying it )\nA firewood holder allows more air to enter below the burning logs and improves the airflow a lot.\nIf you don’t have a firewood holder yet, then I highly recommend trying them!\n#2 Install a wood stove insert If you have an old large-sized wood stove or even a fireplace, you should install a wood stove insert.\nA wood stove insert transforms your old burning chamber into a modern high-efficiency stove.\n#3 Install a reflective heat shield behind your wood stove To improve your wood stove’s efficiency, install a reflective heat shield to the walls behind your wood stove.\nActually, heat shields are used to protect the walls from heat. But accordingly, all the heat that does not enter your walls (thanks to the heat shield) stays in your room.\nSo, heat shields increase your wood stove’s efficiency.\nAnd if you don’t have one, you should get one!\n#4 Wood stove fans Wood stove fans are small fans to place on your wood stove. They need no batteries and they are powered entirely by the rising heat of your wood stove.\nMany people say that wood stove fans increase your wood stove’s efficiency. And indeed, they blow some air into the room.\nHowever, that does not really change the technical efficiency of your wood stove.\nRather, it affects the perceived efficiency slightly (because warm air is blown toward you).\nI’d say wood stove fans are too weak to really make a big difference. But they are a nice gimmick and a conversation starter.\nThis wood stove fan (click here to view it on amazon) is very popular, in case you are interested in getting one.\nIf they really improve your wood stove’s efficiency, then only slightly.\n#5 Install a chimney liner Chimney liners are inserts that you insert into your chimney. They reduce your chimney’s diameter to optimize for airflow.\nA too-small diameter prevents airflow, while a too-large diameter allows for too-large volumes of air to move at low speed.\nA chimney insert optimizes your chimney’s diameter for the stack effect which causes air to be sucked upward through your chimney.\nThis would improve the air drawn into your wood stove and, therefore, increase the burning rate of your wood stove.\nChimney liner installation is usually a larger project, so before you do that, try the previous tips!\n#6 Install a catalytic combustor If you have an older wood stove that\u0026rsquo;s not as efficient as modern ones, you can add a catalytic combustor to it.\nA catalytic combustor improves the heating efficiency of your wood stove by enabling chemical reactions to take place with the gases inside your stove.\n#7 Reinstall the wood stove’s pipe at a proper angle To optimize your wood stove’s burning efficiency your wood stove should allow high airflows.\nIf you must angle your pipe, aim for two 45-degree angles instead of 90 degrees. Straight pipes allow for stronger air drafts and promote more efficient burning.\n#8 Use dry, well-seasoned wood Nothing will cause your wood to burn inefficiently like moisture.\nEssentially, you should harvest your wood at least 2 years before you plan to burn it. Of course, this depends on the climate zone you’re in.\nTo dry wood properly, stack it in an open area where it\u0026rsquo;s exposed to direct sunlight and wind. Of course, the wood should also be covered (ideally with a roof) to protect it from rain and dew.\n#9 Clean your chimney Chimneys are made to allow smooth airflow, so a clogged chimney will disrupt the airflow and cause the stove to burn inefficiently.\nBefore winter or fall seasons start, have a chimney sweep and clean the air pipes connected to the stove.\nThis will remove smoke to leave easily and oxygen to come in, but it also removes creosote deposits on the chimney walls, which is flammable and dangerous.\n#10 Repair the chimney and stove Besides blockage, any warping on the chimney and the stove itself can cause leakage and affect the overall operation of the stove.\nFor this reason, you should also investigate the internal steel parts of the wood stove, as well as the chimney and the airway pipes. If anything seems cracked, warped, or misshaped, have it repaired immediately.\nWhile at it, check the door seal of the stove for leakage. You can lay a dollar bill across the door gasket and then close the door. If you can pull your bill out comfortably, the gasket is too loose and needs to be tightened.\n#11 Set a steady moderate airflow into your wood stove Oxygen is vital for combustion to occur, which is why we need a chimney and vents. However, too much wind will make the logs burn too fast and disappear. To have a steady burn, close the bottom air vents you had opened when lighting the stove and partially cover the chimney. You still need airflow through the chimney but not full-blown wind.\n#12 Burn only a couple of logs at a time Again, a wood stove needs plenty of air to burn wood efficiently and stop wastage. One way to do this is to pack the logs lightly, allowing some space for air inside there. Too many logs cause a slow, smoky burn which is highly wasteful and not hot.\nInstead, wait for the logs to burn down to almost nothing before adding more. It would help if you also raked off some of the ash to ensure adequate airflow. You should only add as many logs as you need, not more.\n#13 Keep it hot Burning wood at moderate heat provides the cleanest, most efficient burn. This cuts down on wastage, chimney build-up, and time. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to think that burning your stove at low will be more efficient, but it\u0026rsquo;s really not.\nDoes using different wood improve wood stove efficiency? Essentially, the heaviest hardwood you can find is the best because it burns hot and slow, so there\u0026rsquo;s no wastage.\nThis however is only important if you are buying the wood. Any free wood around you will be more cost-effective because you are not spending money.\nThat said, using different wood does affect the cost per heat measured in BTU. For example, you get 27.5 million BTU of heat per cord of Beachwood and 30.7 million BTU of heat per cord of Oak.\nAlso, the area\u0026rsquo;s humidity and type of wood may require you to adjust the stove\u0026rsquo;s oxygen intake to ensure the wood is burning as efficiently as possible. But, aside from that, the type of wood doesn\u0026rsquo;t really affect the stove\u0026rsquo;s efficiency in any way.\nConclusion The best way to improve a wood stove\u0026rsquo;s efficiency is to install a heat shield and improve the airflow into your wood stove (by using a fireplace insert or a chimney liner).\nAdditionally, you should use well-seasoned wood and maintain the wood stove.\nThe type of wood you are using may not matter much as long as it\u0026rsquo;s completely dry and the stove is working properly without any blockage or leaks.\nAfter all, wood-burning stoves are the most efficient off-grid heating method and the most affordable.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-improve-wood-stove-efficiency/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIs your wood-burning stove not producing enough heat?

In our wood workshop, we have a 30-year-old oil-filled radiator that’s still fully functional. In comparison, other space heater types age much faster.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s check what makes an oil-filled radiator last for so long.\nAnd also, I am going to tell you what you can do to increase your oil radiator’s lifespan even more.\nQuick answer: An oil-filled radiator lasts at least 20+ years. If it is not exposed to weather and large temperature changes, then it can easily work well beyond 30 years. The main reason is that oil-filled radiators don’t have any built-in moving parts that wear down.\nBut there’s even more to it.\nHow long do oil-filled radiators last? An average oil-filled radiator lasts at least 20 years. Here’s a table with oil heater lifespans depending on usage.\n**Usage situation****How long will an oil-filled radiator last?**Indoor usage (supply heat)\u0026gt;30 yearsBasement / Attic (rare usage)\u0026gt;30 yearsWorkshop / Garage (occasional usage)\u0026gt;20 yearsIndoor usage (main heat source)\u0026gt;15 yearsMobile home / RV\u0026gt;15 years\nTable explanation:\nAn oil-filled radiator lasts a long time if it is not moved a lot and is not exposed to temperature changes and weather.\nThat’s why oil heaters last for well over 30 years if they serve as an occasional indoor heat source.\nIf an oil-filled heater is used outdoors, or in places with more “extreme” temperature changes, such as garages, workshops, or RVs, where they get moved around, then its lifespan decreases.\nWhat’s a durable oil-filled radiator model? If you are looking for an oil-filled radiator, I highly recommend this Pelonis oil-filled radiator (click here to read my review).\nIt is a simple heater, without any fancy features. It heats perfectly well, and because it comes without many extras, there’s nothing that can break.\nSo, it will last you for a (very) long time!\nWhy do oil-filled radiators last so long? There are many reasons oil-filled radiators are almost indestructible. Here’s a list of some reasons:\n#1 Oil-filled radiators are maintenance-free Oil-filled radiators are maintenance-free. You will never need to exchange the oil because it is stored fully sealed inside the heater’s metal body.\nSo, it is impossible that the oil ever leaves the heater, unless the heater is damaged. So, you won’t ever need to refill an oil-filled radiator.\nAdditionally, most oil-filled radiators have no built-in fans which blow air, because the heat is distributed through convection.\nIf there are no built-in fans and no moving parts in general, then this also means that there’s nothing to maintain. Only moving parts need maintenance.\nWhat doesn’t move, doesn’t need maintenance.\n#2 Oil-filled radiators contain no moving parts Oil-filled radiators contain no moving parts. This means that there is no internal friction. Any technical system with internal friction wears down over time.\nFriction would cause parts to deteriorate, and oil to get greasy. Also, it would force you to maintain parts after some time.\nHowever, if no parts ever move, then there’s nothing to wear down. And if nothing in a heater wears down, then the heater lasts for decades.\nThere are oil-filled heaters (and other space heaters) that have built-in fans. These fans will wear down with time. That’s why I recommend getting an oil-filled radiator without fans.\nThese fans are not even necessary for the heating, since they don’t really distribute heat better than the large finned metal body itself.\n#3 Oil-filled radiators don’t burn any fuel Oil-filled radiators don’t burn any fuel. This has three implications:\nNone of the oil inside it is ever used up There will never be overly hot temperatures inside an oil-filled radiator Soot or other waste material buildup is impossible All of these things would wear down fuel or gas-burning heaters over time. But they don’t apply to oil-filled radiators. How nice!\n#4 Oil heater heating elements don’t overheat What’s the difference between an oil-filled radiator and any other space heater? It’s the form of heat distribution.\nThe main difference between an oil-filled radiator and other electric space heaters is that the heating element is embedded inside an oil-filled metal body.\nThe oil surrounding the heating element wicks the heat away from the heating element. The oil then transports the heat to the large metal surface where it is given off to the room’s air.\nThis means that an oil-filled radiator never overheats. The oil wicking away the heat from the heating element ensures that the heating element’s temperature is moderate at all times.\nWhile other space heaters’ heating elements get glowing red hot, that’s not possible for an oil-filled radiator. This ensures that the heating element never overheats.\nAnd because of the resulting even heat distribution within the heater, no parts break down quicker than others.\nThis makes an oil-filled radiator last a very long time. Everything just ties together well. Oil radiators are technically simple but very elaborate.\n#5 Oil heaters are a fully enclosed system The metal body containing the oil of the oil-filled radiator is fully enclosed. This means that none of the oil inside it will ever leave.\nAdditionally, the temperature inside the oil-filled radiator is not hot enough to break down the oil.\nThat’s another reason oil-filled radiators last so long.\nHow to increase an oil-filled radiator\u0026rsquo;s lifespan? Even if an oil-filled radiator lasts for so long, you can still increase its lifespan by many years if you do the following:\nNever damage an oil-filled radiator’s varnish An oil-filled radiator’s heating body is sealed using a special varnish that prevents the metal from oxidizing.\nIf your oil-filled radiator tips over and that varnish is damaged, then breakdown begins.\nDon’t expose your oil-filled radiator to weather Don’t let your oil-filled radiator stand outdoors where it is exposed to rain, snow, and hailstorms.\nBad weather wears down the outer shell of your oil heater and might open it up for oxidation.\nUse your oil heater at moderate temperatures only Oil-filled radiators can output a lot of heat. However, you shouldn’t always blast your oil-filled radiator at full power. Aside from the high electricity cost of oil-filled radiators, the large temperature changes increase the internal wear down of your heater.\nThis is, however, just a small effect. So, you shouldn’t worry too much about it.\nAt least, I wouldn’t worry about whether my oil heater lasts 25 or 26 years.\nConclusion Oil-filled radiators last well over 20 years. Oftentimes, they last well over 30 years, depending on how they are used.\nThe lack of moving parts and internal friction makes oil-filled radiators the most durable type of space heater. Which is why they are my personal favorites!\nThey just heat, and heat, and heat. And they never break down.\nAn oil-filled radiator might stop working only after 25 years. But until that time, your personal situation has changed, your home might have changed, and technology might have changed, and you don’t even need that heater anymore.\nSo, enjoy your oil-filled radiator while it lasts!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-long-do-oil-filled-radiators-last/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOil-filled radiators last a long time.

However, you can do something about it. In this article, you’re going to learn how long air conditioners last, and how you can extend the lifespan of your air conditioner!\nQuick answer: Yes, air conditioners wear out. You can expect an air conditioner to last 20+ years if you maintain it once a year. If you skipped your maintenance, you can revive your air conditioner by changing air filters, cleaning the evaporator coil, and fully dusting the internals.\nDo air conditioners wear out? Yes, air conditioners wear out with time. The main reason is internal friction. Air conditioners have moving parts inside, such as a fan or a compressor. These wear out with time.\nJust like the moving parts in a car.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t maintain your air conditioner, you will have to replace these parts.\nHowever, this can be prevented!\nAnother reason for air conditioners wearing out is the exposure to outside influences such as weather. Especially when there\u0026rsquo;s lots of rain where you live, the rain can enter your air conditioner and cause parts to oxidize and wear out.\nAlso, wind can carry dirt into the outdoor part of your air conditioner. The dirt travels deeper and deeper into your air conditioner over time, until it reaches the moving elements and increases the wear-down rate.\nAir conditioners wear out with running time Air conditioners wear out the more you use them. Here’s a table with estimates how long well-maintained ACs last for different average daily running durations:\n**Average daily AC running duration****How long will an air conditioner last?**2h\u0026gt;25 years4h\u0026gt;15 years8h\u0026gt;10 years24h\u0026gt;5 years\nAn average AC has a lifespan of 18,250 hours. This number is derived from the assumption that an AC used for 2h a day will last for 25 years.\nNote that the 2h a day is an average value. This includes higher usage during summer and no or reduced usage during wintertime.\nDoes air conditioner refrigerant wear out? Theoretically, air conditioner refrigerant lasts forever, since the air conditioner is a fully sealed system and the refrigerant is not used up or burned.\nAir conditioner refrigerant can only wear out if the air conditioner\u0026rsquo;s internal ducts leak. This only happens if the air conditioner is damaged by impact or if weather wears down the ducts over time.\nHow long do air conditioners last? Modern air conditioners last at least 20 years if properly cared for. Older models last anywhere from 15 to 30 years. Actually, the longevity of an air conditioner depends more on how well you maintain it rather than the brand of the air conditioner.\n**Maintenance Frequency****How long will an air conditioner last?**twice a year\u0026gt;25 yearsyearly\u0026gt;20 yearsevery second year\u0026gt;10 yearsevery third year\u0026gt;5 years\nYou see that the “law of diminishing returns” applies here. Yearly maintenance is much better than maintenance every second year. However, increasing maintenance frequency any further (eg. twice a year) won’t bring you a proportional increase.\nThe sweet spot for air conditioner maintenance is once a year.\nBuild quality is, of course, also a factor.\nA well-maintained air conditioner will last 30+ years. However, in 30 years, there will probably be new technology you can replace your old AC with.\nHow to maintain an air conditioner for increased lifespan? You can increase an air conditioner\u0026rsquo;s lifespan by maintaining it once a year. You will have to replace the air filters and clean the evaporator coil each year.\nFor air filter replacement, just get a regular air filter you find online. If you want the air to be filtered very well, then get a HEPA air filter. These can even filter smoke.\nFor the evaporator coil cleaning, I recommend getting this evaporator coil cleaning foam (click here to view it on amazon) and this evaporator coil cleaning brush kit (click here to view it on amazon).\nYou can do the air filter replacement and the evaporator coil cleaning in one go.\nFirst, open your air conditioner.\nThen, dust it using a dry brush. Using a dry brush instead of a wet one is important since your air conditioner is full of dust and bacteria. When you wet dust and bacteria, your air conditioner will start smelling.\nAnd you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to get rid of that smell easily.\nAfter dry-brushing your air conditioner, replace the air filter(s).\nAnd then, clean the evaporator coil using the evaporator coil cleaning kit. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use the recommended AC cleaning brush, you can also use a toothbrush (or any other kind of brush).\nHow to revive an air conditioner If your air conditioner gets to a point where it does not cool properly or it does not even turn on, then you can take the following steps to revive your old air conditioner.\nWhat to do if your air conditioner does not turn on? If your air conditioner does not turn on, then:\nCheck for a blown fuse or a tripped circuit breaker. Check if the power supply of your air conditioner is working. If possible, run your AC from another wall outlet (not possible with all AC models). A fuse or circuit breaker inside the AC could be blown or tripped. These are relatively easy to check. A blown fuse can be changed easily. And a tripped circuit breaker can simply be switched on again.\nWhat to do to improve the cooling of an old air conditioner? To improve the cooling of your old air conditioner, clean the air filters and the evaporator coil. Also, ensure that the built-in fans are free of dust. Remove any excess dust from your AC.\nAfter that, your air conditioner should run properly again!\nIf it doesn’t, you can let a professional check the AC for regassing and potential refrigerant leaks.\nIf you have a portable AC or a window AC, ensure that the window setup is properly sealed. For portable ACs, insulate the hose using an insulation wrap.\nConclusion How long an air conditioner lasts and how quickly it wears out depends entirely on how well you maintain it.\nA regular AC will last you for well over 20 years if your clean its internals and change the air filters once a year.\nMaintaining an air conditioner more frequently is not worth it since it increases the lifespan only slightly.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/do-air-conditioners-wear-out/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAir conditioners wear out over time.

(High vs Low Maintenance)"},{"content":"Here are the best propane heaters for high altitude. The burn of propane heaters becomes less efficient with increasing altitude. However, some heaters are proven to work by the camping and outdoor community.\nIn this article, we’re going to check the best propane heaters for high altitudes. We’re going to check why altitude is a problem for all propane heaters. And we’re going to check what you can do about it.\nQuick answer: The best propane heaters for high altitude are the Mr. Heater Buddy and Big Buddy models. They come with a safety oxygen sensor that detects improper burn at high altitudes. However, any good-quality heater will work at altitudes up to at least 15,000 feet.\nI have successfully used a propane heater at 13,250 feet (4038 meters) altitude on an Everest Region trek in Nepal. It worked perfectly fine. I remember there were gas-heated showers up to 15,800 feet (4800 meters). And the gas heating only stopped at this altitude because it was the end of the trek.\nSo, I am very confident that the heaters listed below will work up to at least this altitude.\nRecommended heaters for high altitudes (up to 15,000 feet) Let’s have a look at each model.\n#1 Mr. Heater Buddy The Mr. Heater Buddy (click to view it on amazon) produces between 4,000 BTU and 9,000 BTU of heat. That\u0026rsquo;s enough to keep a large tent or even an RV warm. If you are looking for a heater that is able to produce enough heat to dry clothes (from hiking), then I highly suggest looking at the other two heater recommendations.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Buddy is one of my favorite propane heaters, because it is very portable, does not weigh too much, and produces very decent heat off just one or two small propane bottles.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s great when you are outdoors without an RV or a car, and you have to carry things yourself. Although for plain hiking, carrying a full-sized Mr. Heater, even if it\u0026rsquo;s the smallest model might be a bit cumbersome.\nThen, you should just get warm clothing.\n#2 Mr. Heater Big Buddy The Mr. Heater Big Buddy (click here to view it on amazon) is the larger version of the Mr. Heater Buddy. It produces up to 18,000 BTUs which is double the amount of heat of the smaller Mr. Heater Buddy.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Buddy is a great choice for everyone who needs more heat. For example for keeping large tents comfortably warm, and even for drying clothes. For outdoor adventures at high altitude, that\u0026rsquo;s worth gold. I\u0026rsquo;ve been hiking in the Himalayas once and did not have a drying opportunity for 3 days. It\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible to not get sick when you\u0026rsquo;re wet all the time.\nSo, if you\u0026rsquo;re planning to go on a longer trip than 1 or 2 days on high altitude, then I highly suggest getting at least the Mr. Heater Big Buddy.\n“I have the Mr. Heater Big Buddy (takes 2 bottles but puts out a LOT of heat). We have used it over 7,000 feet and in a tent trailer. No issues.”\nexpedition forum member\nIf you’re interested in the Mr. Heater Big Buddy, you can have a look at my Mr. Heater Big Buddy review.\n#3 Tank Top Original 540 Degree Heater My third recommendation is this tank-top propane heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis one is for everyone with increased heating needs. This tank-top propane heater blasts over 45,000 BTU of heat per hour. This is actually enough to keep full-sized living spaces hot.\nIf you want to bring this for your high-altitude tour, you should have a large space to heat.\nThis tank-top propane heater produces enough heat to dry your clothes to sub-Saharan standards.\nOn a full 20lb propane tank, and on full settings it lasts for up to 9.5h. The best thing is: you can mount it on propane tanks up to 100lb.\nSo, on a large tank, you can heat for weeks!\nI recommend this tank-top propane heater if you have a (very) large space to dry, or if you spend your time in very cold, humid, and alpine conditions.\nWhy do Propane Heaters work worse at high altitude? Propane heaters lose their efficiency at high altitude because the oxygen levels decrease. However, for a proper burn, a propane heater needs a propane-to-oxygen ratio of 1:10.\nOnly when propane burns at this exact ratio, it has an ideal burn. An ideal burn is when the propane burns completely with maximum efficiency and without leaving any toxic waste gases such as carbon monoxide.\nWhen you gain altitude, the oxygen available decreases, which prevents the propane from burning at the ideal ratio.\n“The efficiency of Propane-fuelled heating appliances decreases at altitudes above 600 metres (2000 ft).”\nRV forum member\nThere’s not much you can do about the improper burn of propane. You can’t just bring the ratio back to the ideal point unless you also bring oxygen with you.\nAt which altitudes do propane heaters work? Here’s a table showing you the (relative) oxygen levels with ascending altitude. I have added a column that tells you whether your propane heater will work at the corresponding altitude.\n**Altitude (feet)****Altitude (meters)****Relative Oxygen Levels (%)****Will a propane heater work?**0 ft0 m100.00%yes1000 ft305 m96.17%yes2000 ft610 m92.82%yes3000 ft914 m89.00%yes4000 ft1219 m85.65%yes5000 ft1524 m82.78%yes6000 ft1829 m79.43%yes7000 ft2134 m76.56%yes8000 ft2438 m73.68%yes9000 ft2743 m70.81%yes10,000 ft3048 m68.42%yes, but potentially improper burn11,000 ft3353 m65.55%yes, but potentially improper burn12,000 ft3658 m63.16%yes, but potentially improper burn13,000 ft3962 m60.77%yes, but potentially improper burn14,000 ft4267 m58.85%yes, but potentially improper burn15,000 ft4572 m56.46%yes, but potentially improper burn16,000 ft4877 m54.55%yes, but potentially improper burn17,000 ft5182 m52.63%maybe18,000 ft5486 m50.24%maybe19,000 ft5791 m48.33%maybe20,000 ft6096 m46.41%maybe21,000 ft6401 m44.98%maybe22,000 ft6706 m43.06%maybe23,000 ft7010 m41.63%unlikely24,000 ft7315 m40.19%unlikely25,000 ft7620 m38.76%unlikely26,000 ft7925 m37.32%unlikely27,000 ft8230 m35.89%unlikely28,000 ft8534 m34.45%unlikely29,000 ft8839 m33.01%unlikely\nI have seen gas-heated showers on a Nepal trek up to around 16,000 feet. So, unless you’re going higher, there’s absolutely nothing to worry about.\nThis propane gas-heated shower on my Nepal trek at an altitude of worked perfectly fine at an altitude of about 13,250 ft.\nDoes cold weather impact propane burn? Some say that the cold impacts the propane gas burn.\n“It\u0026rsquo;s not altitude, its cold temps that slow or stop propane appliances. It won\u0026rsquo;t vaporize as fast as it gets cold, especially if the container is too small and frost forms on the outside, stopping heat transfer to the bottle, as vaporization from liquid takes heat.”\nforum member\nI think this is just panicking… Unless you’re really spending your time in the freezing cold, I can’t imagine the propane gas itself freezing up at all.\nThe boiling point of propane is -44°F! If you are not going to spend your days in Alaskan or Himalayan winter at extreme altitude, nothing will happen to your propane!\nWhat propane heaters work at high altitude? Any good-quality propane heater will work at a high altitude of up to at least 15,000 feet.\nThere is no reason to think that propane heaters will stop working unless you are going to extreme heights.\nThe burn efficiency might decrease due to the lack of oxygen. But unless you ascend past 15,000 feet, you don’t need to worry about altitude issues with your propane heater at all.\nHow long do propane heaters last at high altitude? At high altitude, a propane tank will last shorter than if you were on sea level. Due to the lack of pressure, the propane gas will leave the propane bottle faster. Additionally, due to the decreased burning efficiency, you will get less heat from your propane.\nWill Mr. Heater work at high altitude? Yes, Mr. Heater propane heaters will work at high altitude. However, any other decent-quality brand will work at high altitude as well.\nMr. Heater is not technically superior and can’t overcome the limits of altitude better than any other propane heater brand.\nI like to recommend Mr. Heater propane heaters mostly because of their safety features (oxygen level detector, tip-over protection), and their build quality.\nConclusion Most propane heaters will work at most altitudes.\n“I\u0026rsquo;ve used propane heaters and stoves at 14,200 feet in Alaska extensively in temps as low as -30°F. [\u0026hellip;] They worked surprisingly well even though most in the \u0026ldquo;propane industry\u0026rdquo; said that was impossible and they would not operate.”\nforum member\nUnless you are going to extreme altitude (higher than 15,000 feet), you won’t need to worry about getting special gear.\nAnd if you are going higher, I recommend hiring a trekking guide or trekking agency who will take care of these worries!

Not only is it uncomfortable to be inside a hot garage during the summer, but a cool garage helps you stay cool-headed when you\u0026rsquo;re doing car repairs or other projects.\nQuick answer: The cheapest way to cool a garage is a floor or ceiling fan. Insulation additionally prevents the heat from entering your garage on hot summer days. Installing air conditioning is rather expensive but very effective for cooling.\nKeeping the garage cool in the summertime can be a challenge. Not only do you have to contend with the heat, but also the humidity and pollen.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking to save money on cooling your garage, check out these 14 cheapest ways to do it. From using ice buckets to installing ceiling fans, there is a solution for everyone!\n#1 Fans The cheapest way to cool a garage is by using fans. Floor or ceiling fans can be installed relatively cheaply, and they will quickly circulate the air in the room.\nTechnically, fans don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;cool\u0026rdquo; the air inside the garage. Instead, they draw cool air from the outside, which drops the temperature.\nHere are some fans you can use for cooling the garage:\nCeiling fans - They are good for circulating the air but can\u0026rsquo;t be positioned to direct the airflow. Pedestal fans - They are good for circulating the air and can be positioned to direct the airflow. Window fans- They are perfect for ventilation and cooling down a garage. Floor fans- They are the most inexpensive option and can be positioned to direct the airflow. Wall-mounted fans — These are smaller and more compact, so they\u0026rsquo;re great for controlled ventilation in tight spaces. Dyson fans - They create a smooth airflow but are expensive to run. There are a few ways to cool your garage with fans. One is to open the door and set up a fan to blow air out of the garage. This will create negative pressure and cause cooler air to be drawn into the garage.\nAnother way is to use a floor fan. Place the fan in front of an open window and aim it toward the ceiling. The airflow will circulate around the room and help cool it down.\n#2 Clean Out Garage If you\u0026rsquo;ve been keeping your garage closed off and unused, it\u0026rsquo;s time to start cleaning it out. This will give you more space to store items, as well as make the area cooler and more comfortable.\nA cleaned-out and clutter-free garage mean good airflow and less temperature.\nHere are some tips on how to make the most of your garage storage space:\nStore only what you need. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use something, take it down from its shelf or put it away where you can find it easily. This will minimize the amount of tidying up that needs to be done later. Make sure items are properly aligned and spaced apart so they won\u0026rsquo;t block airflow or sunlight access. This will help ensure everything stays cool and dry. Use dividers or shelves strategically placed near the door for shoes, hats, jackets, etc., so they don\u0026rsquo;t take up too much space in the main area of the garage. These smaller pieces of gear can then be stored more efficiently elsewhere when not needed. #3 Insulate Garage Insulating your garage is a great way to keep it cool in summer and warm in winter. Not only will this help reduce energy costs, but it will also improve the overall climate of the home.\nOnce you have chosen an insulating material(s), installation can be done by yourself or a professional contractor.\nOne popular option is styrofoam Insulation. Here are some advantages of using styrofoam insulation:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very cost-effective per square foot The one-time expense will benefit you for years to come Doesn\u0026rsquo;t create any negative environmental effects (like releasing harmful chemicals into the air) Styrofoam doesn’t break down or lose its effectiveness over time as traditional insulation materials can. It also stays put even when wet, meaning there are no messy repairs or replacements. In fact, styrofoam has been known to last for decades without any maintenance!\nInsulating your garage ceiling can be done in several ways:\nInstalling an insulated roof Installing framed insulating panels Using batten insulation Roxul mineral wool insulation is another option for garages which is great for fire resistance. It also has a high R-value which means it can help keep your home cool in summer and warm in winter.\n#4 Install Roof Vents Installing roof vents is a great way to keep a garage cool during summer. The vents allow hot air to escape while cooler air is drawn in from the outside.\nThis can help to keep the temperature inside the garage more comfortable and can also help to prevent damage to items that are stored inside.\nPassive ventilation is cheaper and easier to install than active ventilation, which is why it’s a great option for garages. However, if your garage is too hot during the summer, you should opt for active ventilation.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how to install roof vents:\nBegin by finding the center of your garage roof and marking it with a pencil. Cut two holes in the roof, using a hole saw, that are slightly larger than the diameter of your roof vents. Install the roof vents by inserting them into the holes from the outside of the roof. Use sealant or caulk around the edges of the vents to create a weather-proof seal. Vents can also get rid of the fumes and moisture that can build up in a garage due to the vehicle, making it more comfortable to work in.\n#5 Replace Shingles With Brighter Color Replacing your shingles with a lighter color can help keep your garage cooler. This is because darker colors absorb more heat, while lighter colors reflect more heat. There are a few things you can do to make this change:\nFirst, consult your local roofing company to find the lightest color shingle to use.\nSecond, ask your builder if they can apply a reflective coating to the underside of your existing shingles.\nThis will help reflect more heat away from the garage and keep it cooler in the summertime.\n#6 Close Gaps Below Doors If you want to keep your garage cool, close the gaps below your doors. This will help to prevent hot air from entering the garage and will also help to keep the cool air inside the garage.\nTo close gaps below doors, install door sweeps. If you still have issues after trying this, seal the gaps with caulk or weather stripping.\nThis will also have similar benefits to insulation, as it will help keep the garage cool and reduce energy costs.\n#7 Open Garage Door (When Cool Outside) When it\u0026rsquo;s cool outside, open your garage door to keep your garage cool. The air circulation will help keep the temperature down and prevent your garage from becoming a sauna.\nIf you keep your garage door closed all the time, it can become hot and stuffy without a proper ventilation system.\nThis works best early morning and late evening when the temperature is relatively cooler. When the temperature starts rising after 10 a.m., opening the garage door will make it hot and humid.\n#8 Change Garage Color Changing your garage\u0026rsquo;s color can help reduce the amount of heat it absorbs from sunlight, which will help keep your car or motorcycle cooler.\nChanging your garage\u0026rsquo;s color is very cost-effective, especially when you currently have a dark-colored garage.\nPainting your garage brightly is a one-off expense. Depending on the paint you get and the size of your garage, it might be anywhere between $100 and $300 in paint.\nBut once your garage is repainted, it\u0026rsquo;s repainted! And it will reflect heat for decades to come!\n#9 Keep Car Outside Your car gets hot when in use, and if you keep it inside your garage, the heat will build up. Ensure that your car windows are open when driving to prevent too much heat from entering the vehicle.\nIf this isn\u0026rsquo;t practically possible, it\u0026rsquo;s best to keep your car outside to keep your garage cool. The heat from your car can raise the temperature of your garage, making it difficult to work in.\nCars are big, heavy objects and have a high heat capacity - once heated up, they retain that heat for a long time.\nIn fact, a hot car will often maintain its heat even inside a garage! This is because garages act as insulators, preventing the car from getting warm quickly. Keeping a car outside can help keep the garage cool in the summertime.\nIf you must park your car in the garage, leave enough room, so the temperature stays comfortable.\n#10 Close Garage Door (When Hot Outside) There is an easy solution if you\u0026rsquo;re having a tough time keeping your garage cool during the summer. Close your garage door when it\u0026rsquo;s hot outside to keep the inside of the garage cooler.\nThis simple trick will help reduce the heat that comes into your home and eliminate any temptation to leave the windows or doors open!\n#11 Use a Dehumidifier You may have noticed that the heat in your garage is unbearable during the summer months. The culprit? Too much humidity!\nDehumidifiers can help to reduce the amount of moisture in space and, consequently, lower the temperature.\nHere are a few tips for using a dehumidifier to keep your garage cool:\nChoose the right size dehumidifier for your room and budget. Smaller machines are best suited for smaller spaces, while larger machines can handle larger spaces more effectively. Set up a schedule for dehumidifying your space. Moisture accumulates over time, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to remove it regularly to maintain optimal conditions. Monitor your machine regularly and clean it as necessary (instructions will come with the machine). This will not only ensure maximal performance from your device but also protect you from potential health hazards posed by harmful bacteria and mold growth #12 Air Conditioning If you\u0026rsquo;re struggling to keep your garage cool in the summer, consider installing an air conditioning unit. Air conditioning units can help to regulate the temperature inside your garage, keeping it comfortable all year round.\nAir conditioning not only keeps the area comfortable but can also help avoid health problems related to humidity and pollen exposure.\nHere are a few air conditioning options for a garage to consider:\nCentral Air Conditioners: A central air conditioning unit may be the best option for keeping your garage cool if it is large enough. These units are large and require an installation crew to install them. They often come with powerful fans and sensors that automatically adjust the airflow to keep your garage comfortable.\nWindow Air Conditioners: If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of space, a window air conditioner may be the perfect solution for keeping your garage cool. These units are small and can be installed on your garage windows. They come with an AC unit and remote control to adjust the temperature to your liking.\nSplit AC: A split AC unit may be the perfect option if you have a small home and only need to cool one room. This is probably the best option if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of space or money.\n#13 Portable Air Conditioning Portable air conditioning can be a big help during hot weather if placed in small garages.\nPortable air conditioners can be easily moved from one part of the home to another when the temperature begins to rise, keeping everyone comfortable.\nNot only will this cooling system keep your car or house cool, but it can also reduce humidity levels in the area.\nTo set up your portable air conditioner, measure how much space you have available and decide what type of climate you want to achieve. A typical portable AC would cost around $250 to $500.\nAlthough it\u0026rsquo;s a cheaper alternative to central air conditioning systems, portable air conditioners are inefficient when it comes to cooling down a large garage.\nHere are my best picks for portable air conditioners for a garage.\n#14 Ice Buckets Another cheap way to cool a garage is by using ice buckets (also known as Swamp coolers). Place several buckets of ice inside your garage at strategic locations, then turn on your fan(s). The cold water will quickly drop the garage\u0026rsquo;s temperature.\nThis method is great if your garage doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any windows or if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend money on an AC unit. A ceiling fan and swamp coolers can cool down a small garage in just minutes!\nJust be sure to keep an eye on the ice buckets, as they can quickly melt and cause puddles.\nKeep in mind ice buckets are not the most efficient way of cooling your garage. Freezing requires a lot of energy consumption. Hence, using it for the long term might not be suitable.\nConclusion Apart from buying air-tight and smartly installed insulation materials, including fans (if applicable) and insulating walls, plenty of cheaper options are also available.\nTry them out yourself, if not for any other reason than to save money!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cheapest-ways-to-cool-a-garage/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you have a garage, you know it can be hot and sweaty.

You may have to identify where the smell is emanating from and what\u0026rsquo;s causing it, but it\u0026rsquo;s safer to clean and deodorize the entire appliance regularly.\nTo remove the smell from your portable AC, just follow the steps below!\nHow to remove portable AC smell Identifying the cause of the smell is sometimes a try-and-error method. You must check each component and clean or change what is necessary until the smell is gone.\nHere are the steps to follow.\n#1 Replace air filters Most portable air conditioners have two filters; one for the evaporator and one for the condenser. Both filters must be changed regularly (preferably monthly or per the manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s instructions) to keep mold and bacteria from growing inside the AC.\nBut if you have reusable filters, take them out and clean them with household detergent or vinegar/water solution. Once they are clean, rinse thoroughly, and air dry outside before putting them back.\n#2 Dry-brush air filters Air filters keep dust and debris from getting inside the AC, but they also ensure there’s enough airflow. This means filters must be kept in tip-top shape throughout, even if it\u0026rsquo;s not yet time to change or clean them.\nBetween changes, dry brush the air filters weekly or as required depending on how dusty your area is, or if you have furry pets. You can also use a vacuum to draw out the dust and debris from the filters.\nThat said, never wet wipe air filters during the mid-month cleaning, as this can encourage mold growth. A good vacuum or dry brushing will be enough until you change the filters.\n#3 Clean evaporator coils The second part you have to clean is the evaporator coils.\nEvaporator coils are the part of the AC that gets cold and cool the room\u0026rsquo;s air. They also dehumidify the air and allow warm moist air to pass through them, leaving traces of moisture. This, combined with dirt, make the perfect home for bacteria and mold growth that can cause a horrible stench.\nYou will access the coil after removing the filter or the front grill.\nShine a flashlight to inspect the coils for any debris, dust, and hair and also to find out if there is mold. Next, use a vacuum cleaner to suck out any debris from the coils\u0026rsquo; surface. You can also use this AC cleaning brush set (click here to view it on amazon) to fluff everything from the coils. Finally, spray a coil cleaning foam on the coils to deep clean the surface and remove grime. If you notice any mold or mildew, use a clean towel with mild household detergent or this CLR mold cleaner to wipe off the coils, and then repeat the same with clean water to rinse. #4 Clean the drain pan and drain line The condensate pan can be a rich haven for foul odor. This is where moisture ends before being directed outside through the drain line. You must empty and clean the two parts regularly to ensure there’s no blockage or bacterial and mold growth.\nDrain the water out of the condensate tank and clean it with soap and water until it’s slime-free. Remove the condensate drain line by pulling it off the drain spout slowly. Then, clean it using water pressure from a hose or faucet and get rid of any slime and mold growth. You can pass the tank and the drain line through a bleach and water solution to kill any mold and mildew. Allow the parts to dry completely before reattaching. #5 Clean the AC exterior While the portable AC is still open, use a dry brush to clean the panels inside and outside, and then wipe clean with a damp cloth. Be sure to get between the vents and any space where dust and debris can hide, and then let the entire appliance dry under the sun.\nWhy does Your Portable AC Smell? A few things can cause a portable air conditioner to smell bad. All of them however are an indicator that your AC is in dire need of a clean-up or a service.\nMore often than not, a bad smell from an air conditioner indicates an airflow and moisture issue inside that’s causing the growth of bacteria, mold and mildew. Without regular maintenance and cleaning, the inside of your AC will be full of dust, debris and moisture, all perfect conditions for bacteria and mold growth.\nRunning your portable AC on low often can also cause bad odor. The AC’s performance is subpar when it’s on low, and it fails to dehumidify the air, leaving all the moisture inside.\nVery rarely though, the smell could be coming from a refrigerant leak. This smell is very distinct, and it smells like gas or car exhaust. If the gas leaks, you may also notice poor performance a few days in.\nHow to Prevent Smell in a Portable AC To prevent smells in a portable AC you must keep your portable AC clean and change the filters regularly. This routine maintenance alone plays the biggest role in keeping organic matter from growing inside.\nAnother precautionary measure is to let the AC run just a little longer on fan mode. After cooling, don’t turn off the AC immediately because the humidity, which enhances mold growth and smell, is still inside.\nInstead, keep running it on fan mode (no-cooling) for a few minutes to blow the humidity out.\nIf you don’t have a fan mode, reduce the cooling settings to the warmest temperature possible, which minimizes the cooling to almost zero.\nIs Portable AC Smell Dangerous? The smell itself is not dangerous, even if the refrigerant is leaking. However, bad odor from a portable AC indicates something is wrong with the appliance.\nIn the best case scenario, you are breathing dirty, bacteria-infested air because the AC interior is too dusty. In the worst case, the AC is blowing dangerous mold fumes your way, or it\u0026rsquo;s about to break down due to overworking or internal damage.\nBreathing mold can be particularly dangerous to your respiratory health, so you should remove mold from an AC as soon as you smell it or even before the smell starts.\nConclusion You can remove bad smells from a portable AC by simply cleaning the internal components and changing the filters. If the smell doesn\u0026rsquo;t go away after cleaning, or you suspect a refrigerant leak, call an AC technician to check out the appliance and advice. The solution could be a simple repair or cleaning of parts that you couldn\u0026rsquo;t open on your own.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-remove-smell-in-portable-ac/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow to remove smell in a portable AC?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick answer: \u003cstrong\u003eThe only way to remove smell from a portable AC is to open it up and clean the components.

However, you can always use dual-hose portable ACs, window ACs and split ACs, as these don’t suck in outdoor air.\n**Air conditioner type****Can you use it when it’s smoky outside?**Single-hose portable ACnoEvaporative cooler (outdoor connected)noDual-hose portable ACyesWindow ACyes (ensure no ‘Fresh Air’ mode is enabled)Split ACyes\nAs you can see, you can use all air conditioner types, except single-hose portable air conditioners and outdoor-connected evaporative coolers.\nSo, if you really need a portable AC model, then I highly suggest getting a dual-hose AC.\nFurther down in this article, I will recommend you a good dual-hose AC!\nWhy can’t you use a single-hose portable air conditioner when it’s smoky outside? A single-hose portable air conditioner has just one hose. This hose is used to expel the hot air outside.\nBut blowing air outside creates a negative pressure inside your room, which, in turn, sucks air from other places, such as other rooms, and also from outdoors.\nA single-hose portable air conditioner sucks in outdoor air and causes smoke to enter your room.\nThe worst thing about single-hose air conditioners during smoky times is that you can’t really do anything to prevent smoke from entering your room. Technically, a portable air conditioner will force outdoor air into your room.\n“Avoid using an evaporative cooler or portable air conditioner with a single hose in smoky conditions unless there is a heat emergency. Using these devices can result in more smoke being brought inside.”\nEPA Indoor Air Quality guide\nThis is not only a drawback of single-hose portable units during smoky times, but it is also a general technical issue.\nThe negative pressure a portable air conditioner creates sucks in warm air from other places into your room. Single-hose ACs even suck in the cold air they just produced and blow it outdoors.\nSo, there are a lot of technical problems with single-hose portable ACs.\nRecommended air conditioner for smoky environments If you live in an area that’s frequently exposed to smoke, such as a wildfire area, or an industrial area, then you can use the following air conditioners.\nDual-hose portable air conditioner Dual-hose portable air conditioners are safe to use when it’s smoky outside. Single-hose units are not safe to use and will suck the outdoor smoke into your room.\nThis Whynter dual-hose portable air conditioner (click here to view it on amazon) will never suck in any outdoor air, and therefore, no smoke.\nThe reason is that it’s a dual-hose system. In a dual-hose portable air conditioner, one hose sucks in air from outside(instead of inside), uses the outside air to absorb heat from the refrigerant, and then blows the outside air outside again.\nSo, the smoky air from outside will never enter your room with a dual-hose portable AC.\nI recommend getting a dual-hose air conditioner if you absolutely need a portable air conditioner, otherwise, you can also stick to the classic air conditioner choices.\nWindow air conditioner Window air conditioners are safe to use when it’s smoky outside.\nMost window air conditioners have just the same advantages as dual-hose portable air conditioners: They don’t suck in any outdoor air.\nSome window air conditioners might have a ‘Fresh Air’-mode, which, when enabled, causes the air conditioner to suck in smoky air from outdoors. If your window AC has such a setting, then you can simply disable it and it will run on indoor air only.\n“If your HVAC system or window air conditioner has a fresh air option (meaning it pulls in air from the outside), turn it off, close the intake, or set the system to recirculate mode.”\nEPA Indoor Air Quality guide\nHowever, since it does not need two long hoses to blow heat, there are no insulation problems:\nWith portable air conditioners, the heat that’s supposed to leave your room partly reenters your room, because the hoses are made of cheap plastic and don’t insulate well.\nA window air conditioner fixes this problem by not having any long paths for the air to take.\nBecause of that, they are more efficient than portable units!\nSplit air conditioner Split AC units are safe to use when it’s smoky outside.\nA split AC unit works technically the same as a dual-hose portable AC or a window AC. All of these don’t suck in air from the outdoors.\nThey suck in indoor air and blow that same air back into your room once it’s cooled.\nDo air conditioners filter smoke? Window air conditioners, split ACs and dual-hose portable air conditioners do not suck in outdoor air. So, there is no need to filter smoke.\nA single-hose portable air conditioner or an evaporative cooler will suck in outdoor air, but won’t filter the smoke.\nIn general, single-hose portable air conditioners are cheaply made, and the air filter is one aspect of the system where manufacturers save money.\nI would not trust them to put a good air filter in the air conditioner.\nSo, if you want filtered air with an air conditioner, then you should insert your own HEPA filter.\nStill, I would not recommend running the air conditioner when it’s smoky outside. Because if something goes wrong, then you will have a smoky indoors.\nAnd you won’t be able to get rid of that!\nWill evaporative coolers filter smoke? Evaporative coolers won’t filter smoke, unless you installed your own certified HEPA filter. And even then, there’s the risk of the filter not being fully sealed and causing smoke to get sucked into your indoors.\nConclusion I recommend not running any single-hose portable air conditioners or outdoor-connected evaporative coolers when it’s smoky outside (during a wildfire or nearby an industrial area).\nInstead, you should buy a proper dual-hose air conditioner, a window AC or a split AC.\nAll of these air conditioner types don’t suck in any outdoor air and you can safely run them when it’s smoky outside.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-use-portable-ac-when-smoky-outside/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou can only use \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e portable ACs when it’s smoky outside, whether that’s because of wildfires or due to an industrial area nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we’re going to check which air conditioners are OK to be used and which aren’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick answer: \u003cstrong\u003eYou should not use a single-hose portable AC when it’s smoky outside.

Both wood and propane gas provide lots of heat at a low cost. Heating with wood minimizes your dependency on anyone since it is available (for free) around your cabin.\nThe 5 Best Methods to Heat a Cabin without Electricity Let’s take a look at 5 different methods to heat an off-grid cabin without electricity.\n#1 Wood-burning stove The best way to heat a cabin without electricity is with a wood-burning stove.\nWood is objectively the most cost-effective heat resource. To produce 1 million BTUs of heat energy from wood costs just $10.91. That’s by far the lowest cost per heat you can get.\nFor comparison, the same amount of heat in electricity would cost about $87.98.\nBut in a cabin, you’re not just looking to cut costs. Accessibility and availability are equally important.\nAnd wood is usually abundant in the areas around cabins. With wood, you don’t have to rely on a third person. Or on any company’s products.\nYou only rely on your own ability to chop wood trunks to firewood. And in an off-grid situation, it’s always better to not depend on anyone (if it’s not necessary).\nThat’s why I rank a wood-burning stove as the number one choice for every cabin owner. Don’t have a wood stove? Get one!\n“For me, the best heating option for the small wilderness cabin is a wood stove - especially when there is a lot of free firewood on your property.”\nsmall-cabin forum member\n#2 Propane gas heater A propane heater is the second best choice for heating a cabin without electricity. Propane gas is very durable, comparably cheap, and also very accessible.\nPropane gas costs you $35.28 per million BTU of heat. This means it is technically 3x the cost of wood. But still, it is less than half of the cost of electric heating.\nAlso, we have to factor in that the price of wood is just for unprepared wood, which you have to put effort into to transform into dried and chopped firewood. Meanwhile, a propane tank can be connected to a propane heater and fired up without any work involved.\nSo, the reduced cost of wood in comparison to propane gas likely is because you have to invest your own time and work in wood. Which you don’t have to do when heating with propane.\nRecommended propane heater for cabins Anyways, my favorite propane heater is the Mr. Heater Big Buddy (click here to see the review).\nIt’s an 18,000 BTU heater which is perfectly capable of heating even large cabins. For regular-sized cabins and regular (economical) heating on the 4,000 BTU setting, one 20lb propane gas tank will last you for about 4 and a half days of continuous usage.\nThat means with 8h of heating a day, that heater will last you for almost 14 days until you have to refill. Pretty good.\nReuse propane gas for cooking in your cabin The best thing about having a propane heater with a propane tank is that, aside from the heating, you can connect that same propane tank to a propane stove and use it for cooking.\nSo, if you are cooking with propane gas anyways, then you can get a propane heater just as an emergency backup. You have the gas available anyways.\n#3 Portable Generator (Gas, Diesel, or Gasoline) To heat a cabin without depending on an electric grid, you can generate your own electricity.\nGenerators that produce more than 2,000W can power a regular 1,500W electric space heater.\nFor heating a cabin without electricity, gas and fuel-based generators are a good choice. But heating off generators also introduces a few technical issues \u0026hellip;\nFor example, in wintertime Diesel gets thick (from the cold), so a Diesel generator will not run as smoothly and might not be able to produce the required wattage.\nIn general, using generators for heating is not the best idea.\nFirst, you will have to run the generator outdoors (because of carbon monoxide) and use an extension cord to connect the space heater which is standing indoors.\nThis means that all the heat the generator produces from the friction is wasted outdoors. This, in turn, means that only a fraction of the available energy in the generator’s fuel is made available to you inside the cabin.\nBecause of this energy loss, generating your own electricity and using it for heating is inefficient. Instead, you should use the fuel directly for heating using an appropriate heater such as a stove or a gas heater.\n“The truth isn\u0026rsquo;t that electric heat isn\u0026rsquo;t less efficient, it\u0026rsquo;s more costly (electric heating is one of the few 100% efficient processes in physics, wood burning is only about 50%). I know it\u0026rsquo;s splitting hairs, but heating with electricity while attempting to be off-grid is a nightmare.”\nsmall-cabin forum member\n#4 Kerosene Stove Kerosene stoves are usually meant for cooking. However, you can use them for heating as well.\nThey are relatively small heat sources, so a kerosene stove might only be suitable for supplemental or emergency heat.\nPlease be aware that kerosene stoves are not designed for heating, and therefore, oftentimes their oxygen intake is not properly adjusted, which results in an improper burn that emits carbon monoxide.\nAs a general rule of thumb: Whenever you use a burning heat source that is not designed for continuous heating (such as small cooking stoves, or burners), then you should regularly vent your cabin.\nI’ve included kerosene stoves in this list for completeness, but actually, wood-burning stoves or propane gas heaters are by far the best choices for you.\n#5 Oil Lamps Aladdin-style oil lamps are another method to heat a cabin without electricity. However, usually, these lamps are old, improperly adjusted, and will emit carbon monoxide.\nAdditionally, the oil to fire these oil lamps is overpriced. You can also use vegetable oil instead. But that’s overpriced as well.\nIn general, most heat sources except wood and propane are unreasonable money-wise.\nYou might think that your bottle of oil was just a few dollars. But when you look up the heat capacity of that oil and relate it to the amount of money you paid, it can get well over the hundreds of dollars per million BTU of heat.\nSo, oil lamps are an emergency heat (and light) source. But I would never rely on them for heating. Oil lamps output only little heat. And the refill costs too much for the little amount of heat you get.\nHow to heat water in a cabin without electricity To heat water in a cabin without electricity, a propane gas or kerosene stove with a kettle on top works best.\nA wood-burning stove works just as well. It just needs more time to fire up. While a propane stove is ready for cooking instantly, a wood-burning stove needs at least 20 minutes.\nOf course, you don’t fire a wood stove just for boiling a cup of tea. And that’s where propane comes in handy.\nWith an electric generator, you could connect an electric stove or kettle and you would also be able to cook. Running a generator just for cooking is, however, a bit overpowered.\nHow to insulate a cabin to hold more heat? Aside from heating your cabin, keeping the heat becomes equally important. Especially when you want to heat economically and you don’t want to chop wood or refill propane tanks all day.\nFor this, I highly suggest adding roof insulation to your cabin.\nGenerally, styrofoam works very well. However, in cabins there is an increased risk of fire and styrofoam would not really help. So:\nTo add insulation to your cabin, add an additional layer of wood to your roof. Ideally, this second layer should leave a gap in the original layer of wood to create insulating air pockets.\nAdditionally, you can hand carpets on the walls. And you can insulate windows by adding a window insulation shrink kit (click here to view it on amazon).\nIn an off-grid situation, it’s always good to have a backup for your heating. Here’s how to heat without a heater.\nHow to stay safe heating a cabin without electricity Whenever you use a burning heat source indoors, you should install a carbon monoxide and a smoke detector.\nBoth of these will save your life. And depending on your location and your insurance, these might even be required.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-heat-a-cabin-without-electricity/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTo heat a cabin without electricity, your best options are wood or propane gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick answer: \u003cstrong\u003eThe best way to heat a cabin without electricity is a wood-burning stove or a propane heater.

In this article, we’re checking three different air conditioner types: portable, window, and split ACs.\nFor a garage, you should not shortcut your air conditioning. Here’s why:\nQuick answer: Mini-split ACs are the best type of air conditioner for garages. They provide enough cooling power, don’t consume any floor space, and don’t need any windows for installation. A good mini-split unit will last you for decades if you take care of it.\nLet’s have a look at each air conditioner type in more detail.\nWhich type of portable air conditioner is best-suited for garages? What do we want in a garage air conditioner? First and foremost, it should cool the garage during the blasting summer heat. Looks are secondary. Ideally, a garage AC should not occupy any space (which is limited in garages).\nSo, without further analysis, here’s my personal recommendation:\nRecommended mini-split AC for all garage sizes I recommend this Mr. Cool mini-split AC (click here to view it on amazon), which comes with a full DIY kit and requires comparably little installation work.\nThis AC is a real AC system that takes no shortcuts. No weird window setups that block the entire window from opening.\nThis mini-split AC is perfect for garage owners who like to do things themselves (which I assume most of you are).\nWhy do I recommend this exact model? The cooling capacity of this split AC is 18,000 BTU, which is high enough to cool down even large garages with attached workshops. It also has a heating mode to keep you warm in the cold season!\nAnd the installation of this split AC is easy and requires no professional training. All you need to do is pass one pipe through a wall. So, you will have to cut a total of just one hole.\nThat’s something anyone can do. And that’s why I recommend this model.\nNow, technically, in terms of energy efficiency or cooling capacity, it is no better or worse than other split AC units.\nI just liked the simple installation and the cooling power. If you already have another split AC lined up, then go for it!\nWhich types of AC can you install in a garage? Let’s have a look at the three different types of air conditioners you can use in a garage.\nMini-split AC The mini-split AC represents the regular kind of AC that we know. One component of the unit is located indoors, while the compressor unit is located outdoors.\nNot only does this reduce the noise, but it is technically superior to other air conditioner types. The heat extraction process of a split AC takes place outdoors. The cooled air is blown indoors.\nThis separation is necessary to achieve good efficiency and high cooling capacity. Because when an AC extracts heat from the refrigerant indoors (which portable air conditioners do), then we have the issue of making sure the heat does not reenter the room.\nWith a split AC, this is technically impossible.\nMini-split ACs are objectively the best air conditioners for garages. They don’t have any efficiency problems. They don’t occupy or even block windows (such as portable or window ACs). And they don’t take up floor space (such as portable ACs).\nAlso, they are very slim, as the large component is located outdoors. With a window AC, you would have half of the AC taking up space in front of the window.\nMini-split ACs are reliable, they need only little maintenance, and therefore, will last you a long time. You’ve probably seen garages with split AC units multiple decades old.\nThat’s why I would always opt for a mini-split AC.\nWindow AC Window ACs are suitable for garages with large windows and lots of space.\nThey consume quite a lot of space in front of the window. And they need just as much, if not, even more, installation work than a split AC.\nThe reason is that you have to set up the window construction to hold it in place. And then, you will have to insulate the window properly. For some window types (such as tilting windows), you would even have to remove the entire window for installation.\nIn the worst case, the window AC will barely fit into your window and block off all of the sunlight. And who in the world wants to sacrifice his last garage window?\nTo say something positive, window ACs have an efficiency just as good, or almost as good, as split ACs, if they are properly installed.\nThe reason is that half of the AC is located outdoors. So, the refrigerant heat extraction takes place outdoors, and you don’t have the issue of heat reentering the room, that portable ACs have.\nAlso, window ACs provide very high cooling capacities that match those of split ACs. The cooling capacities go up to 30,000 BTU or more, which is a lot more than what you’d need for your garage anyways.\nI’d say you should get a window AC only if you rent your garage and you are not allowed to drill holes through your garage walls. But if you get a window AC, then measure the dimensions of your garage window first and ensure that the window AC fits the window.\nIn almost any other case, I’d highly recommend getting a split AC instead.\nPortable AC You can use a portable AC in a garage. Even in a garage without windows, you can install a portable AC by drilling one venting hole through the wall.\nIf you absolutely need to get a portable air conditioner, read my recommendations for the best portable air conditioners for garages.\nHowever, efficiency-wise portable air conditioners can’t keep up with mini-split units or window ACs.\nAlso, you will have to regularly drain the accumulated condensate from the AC, which can get annoying.\nYou can build yourself an automatic drain by connecting a drain hose, and (if necessary) a drain pump. However, this requires a lot of installation effort. And why not use your energy to install a split AC instead?\nOn top of all of that, portable ACs waste precious floor space in your garage. You can expect an average portable air conditioner to block at least 16 square feet of floor area.\nA split AC will block none.\nHere’s a forum quote that I liked:\n“Don\u0026rsquo;t waste your time on a portable unit. They are garbage. Punch a hole through the wall, and get a through-wall unit.”\nWhich AC type is best for different garage sizes? A mini-split AC will be the best air conditioner type for all garages. For most window ACs you will need to account for some extra space, as the window AC will occupy the window and block the area in front of it.\nA portable AC will occupy the largest space and is, therefore, only suitable for larger garages, where it won’t be able to supply enough cooling power.\nTo find the best-suited air conditioner cooling capacity for your garage, I used standard garage sizes. Assuming you need 20 BTU per square foot, you get the following results:\nGarage sizeGarage AreaCooling Capacity (BTU)****Best AC Type1 car garage240 – 384 sq. ft.4,800 BTU - 7,680 BTUsplit or portable2 car garage440 – 624 sq. ft.8,800 BTU - 12,480 BTUsplit, window or portable3 car garage620 – 816 sq. ft.12,400 BTU - 16,320 BTUsplit or window4 car garage800 – 1056 sq. ft.16,000 BTU - 21,120 BTUsplit or window\nThe AC type recommendations are based on the cooling capacity of the ACs and the available free space.\nFor example, a 1-car garage will usually not have enough space in front of a window to support a window AC.\nIn a 2-car garage, all AC types are suitable.\nFor larger 3 or 4-car garages, split or window units are the best type of air conditioner, as they have a large cooling capacity suitable for large spaces. Portable ACs would not be able to cool these large spaces efficiently.\nWhich air conditioner is best for a garage without a window? For a garage without a window, a split AC is the best.\nA window AC would (obviously) be the worst choice as there is no window to fit it. You can, technically, install a window AC without a window. But that’s a stressful and highly suboptimal thing to do.\nPortable ACs are suitable for garages without windows if you can set up the AC through a drilled hole.\nBut this rarely makes sense. Especially considering that you can get a regular split AC unit where you will have to drill a hole anyways. And you won’t have to deal with all the disadvantages (bad efficiency, space blocking, low cooling capacity) of portable air conditioners.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/which-air-conditione-type-is-best-for-garage/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMini-split ACs are the best air conditioner type for garages.

Although it could be demanding and difficult, employing an alternative to vent your air conditioner is not impossible.\nQuick answer: You can vent a portable air conditioner without a window by using different alternatives such as; through the door, wall, drop ceiling, chimney, or even the dryer vent. It is possible that not every alternative may apply to you since they have different requirements, but you can always check which one would work well for you.\nNow that you have a quick answer and already know about the few alternatives for venting a portable AC. Let’s hop onto a detailed answer and check out each alternative clearly.\nIn this article, I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how to vent a portable air conditioner without necessarily using a window. Read on to find out more!\nHow Does a Portable Air Conditioner Work? A portable air conditioner works in a way that captures the heat and moisture out of the air in your room, leaving the cool air behind. It moves the captured heat outside through the hose wherever you vent your portable air conditioner.\nThe portable air conditioner has an evaporator coil. The air in your room flows through the evaporator coil, which absorbs large amounts of heat. The heat is then transferred to the condenser coil when it is transferred into liquid.\nNormally, the other side of the air conditioner has to go outside, consisting of a condenser and compressor. The condenser condenses the humidity into water droplets, and there is a fan that helps transfer the heat to the outside surroundings.\nThe fan and the compressor inside the air conditioner make the most noise.\nFor regular ACs, that\u0026rsquo;s not an issue because the noisy compressor is located outdoors. But with portable ACs, all the components are bundled up in one device, which makes them comparably loud.\nThe hot air in the portable air conditioner is vented out through the vent hose. And it is important to use a hose or else the hot air will stay in your room.\nWhy Is It Important to Vent the Portable AC? It is important to vent the portable ac since, without venting, it will be of no use. No doubt, it will run normally but since it won’t have any place to exhaust the warm air, it will exhaust it back into the room instead of the cool air, and the room’s temperature won’t decrease.\nKeep in mind that while the portable air conditioners deliver cool air, they also let out warm air. Hence, it is important that you let the heat out in the right place. Otherwise, the hot air will remain trapped in the room and no matter how long you let the air conditioner run, it will not cool the room.\nSince a portable AC also eliminates the moisture from the air through venting, if you don’t vent it, the moisture continues to build up and it will neutralize the cooling effect of your air conditioner.\nThe moisture will increase the humidity in the room, and it will not be able to become cool.\nI have written a detailed guide on this topic: Do Portable Air Conditioners need to be Vented?\nAlternatives of Venting the Portable AC Venting MethodProsConsVenting through the doorEasient venting method, Easy to remove and installOnly works well with sliding doorsVenting through the wallPermanent solution for ventingDrilling a hole isn’t easy, risk of damaging wires, and other objectsVenting through the drop ceilingDIY installationExcess heat could encourage moldVenting through chimneyEasy and convenient installationInvolves a risky operationVenting through dryer ventNo installation neededCan\u0026rsquo;t do laundry while AC is in use\nLet’s discuss each method in detail.\nVent Through the Door Your room may not have windows, but it definitely has a door.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have access to a window in your room, the easiest and simplest option that would occur in a person’s mind is to use a door to vent the portable air conditioner. A door would definitely serve the same purpose as a window, but you must be aware of where the door you\u0026rsquo;re using to vent your air conditioner leads.\nIf your door leads to a hallway or any other room in your house, your AC won’t be as effective since you will not get the desired temperature.\nOn the other hand, if your door leads to a balcony, it is perfect for venting out the warm air. This way it will vent the air outside just as it would through a window.\nA sliding door is what you should prefer to go with if you’re opting to vent your portable AC unit through a door. In a sliding door, you can install a sliding door seal, this way, only the air exhausted by the AC will go out, and no air from outside will come inside, and your room will stay cool.\nYou might also use a pet door to vent the portable air conditioning unit. Make sure the area around the hose pipe\u0026rsquo;s entrance is tightly sealed to prevent warm air from leaking back into your room.\nVent Through the Wall No one can argue that they don\u0026rsquo;t have a wall in their room, so if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a window or a balcony in your room, you can use your wall to vent your portable air conditioner.\nVenting your portable AC through a wall isn’t as easy as venting it through a door, but it surely works effectively.\nTo start off, you will need to drill a hole in your wall to let the AC vent the warm air outside through the hole. If you’re comfortable with drilling a hole into your wall and own a power drill, this alternative can be a good fit.\nWhen drilling a hole, you must keep a few factors in your mind:\nMake sure the hole isn’t big enough It should only be the size of your portable AC’s hose to let that fit in perfectly. Be very careful — drilling a 6\u0026quot; diameter hole isn\u0026rsquo;t easy. If you\u0026rsquo;re not comfortable, hire a professional to do it for you. Choose a thin wall and one that faces outside and not into any other room. If your walls are steel-reinforced, it\u0026rsquo;s good to call a professional to drill the hole. Although there is no problem if you choose a wall that is opposite any other room, if you’re considerate enough, you wouldn’t want to make the other rooms of your house warm with the vented air while your room stays cool.\nTo be clear, rooms like the laundry room and garage are fine to receive the hot air that is vented out.\nOnce you’re done drilling the hole, consider sealing the openings around the hose, you may use a silicone sealer. Doing this will keep the hot air from re-entering your room and will keep portable AC running costs in control.\nI\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you wouldn’t like two holes in your wall. Hence this method will be convenient for you if you own a single-hose portable air conditioner unit.\nVent Through Drop Ceiling Using a drop ceiling is another way to vent your portable air conditioner. However, you won’t find drop ceilings everywhere, especially in modern houses.\nThe high-ceiling older houses and offices have it, so if you’re planning to install an air conditioner in either of these spaces, you should definitely opt for this alternative.\nSince the venting hose will go all the way up from the portable AC to the ceiling, it is crucial to have an extended vent hose. To have it extended, you can use a specialized drop ceiling venting kit. It works for extending the hose’s length.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve extended the hose and created a hole in the ceiling, and put everything in place, make sure to seal around the connection joints and not impede the wires and pipes to avoid any dangerous circumstances.\nAnd let\u0026rsquo;s face it, it won\u0026rsquo;t offer your room the nicest appearance, so make your decision wisely.\nVent Through the Chimney Venting your portable AC through a chimney is the least-used method and requires a lot of effort. You’ll need to use a cut-off saw, or a hack saw to make the appropriate cuts.\nFirst of all, you will obviously need a chimney in your house, but an unused one. Because if you’re going to install your AC’s hose through a used chimney, then your safety may be at risk, as the plastic hose could potentially catch fire.\nSo, you have to ensure that the chimney setup is safe in your case.\nInstalling a hose all the way up to the chimney can be pretty challenging, so it is best to hire a professional for this.\nA professional will also help you check whether installing a portable AC in a chimney is legally allowed where you live.\nTo install a hose through a chimney, you will certainly need a hose of a length as long as a chimney, so it can reach there and make your portable AC work effectively.\nIf you own a fireplace that is not in your use, you can use it to place your air conditioner and attach its hose to the chimney.\nThis alternative is mostly used for small houses where the length of the chimney is small.\nYou can then use duct tape to seal the holes and ensure that your space is well secured. This method is usually only used if no other method is available, so if it’s not an option for you, don’t worry! There are other ways to vent your portable AC unit.\nVent Through Dryer Vent Although a dryer vent is not the preferred method for venting your portable AC, you can consider it if you have no other choice. If you are successful in making it work, it will be a fairly effective method for venting your AC.\nMost of the dryer vents have smaller-sized holes, which makes it difficult for the hose of your portable AC to pass and fit through it, and it is the main reason for it being not the best alternative.\nHowever, this in no way means that it’s not possible for you to make this alternative practical. If you exert some force and succeed in fitting the hose through the dryer vent, then you’re good to go, and your portable air conditioner will run 24/7 smoothly, making your room chilled.\nHowever, make sure that while you try hard to fit the hose into the dryer vent, you do not damage any part of the objects.\nFactors to Note When Using a Portable AC Here are a few factors you may want to consider when getting your hands on a portable air conditioner:\nIt Produces Noise Noise is one of the factors that may be a drawback for many people. It may be annoying for you, and you also may not be able to get a good night’s sleep due to the disturbance from the air conditioner’s noise.\nHowever, the noise level of the AC varies from brand to brand, so you can do comprehensive research and get the one that may produce less noise compared to others.\nIt Needs a Good Space Portable air conditioners need enough breathing space. Hence, you need to make sure where you place your AC. You can not place it in areas like a garage since the structure of such areas makes it difficult for the air conditioner to cool them, and running it will be of no use.\nEven if you place your portable air conditioner in an appropriate place, like your room, make sure that it has enough breathing space.\nIt Is Energy Efficient All single portable air conditioners come with an energy efficiency rating. The higher the rating is, the more efficiently the portable air conditioner will run.\nHowever, the energy efficiency rating differs amongst portable air conditioners of different companies. You may compare the ones and choose the best one which may meet your requirements.\nIts Unit Compressor Can Be Affected If the hose of your portable air conditioner exerts too much pressure, the compressor will likely shut down entirely or develop a fault. It is not even possible to add or remove hoses from your portable air conditioner, so you can not replace it. Instead, you will have to hire a professional to fix the problem for you or, most likely, get a new air conditioner.\nMake sure not to remove or add hoses, as they could cause serious damage to their functions.\nIs There Any Ventless Alternative to Portable Air Conditioner? There isn’t a ventless alternative to a window , but there surely is to a portable air conditioner. A portable swamp cooler is what you can get your hands on. Although it will not cool the room as a portable AC, the advantage is that it does not require air hoses.\nA swamp cooler traps the heat from your room in the process of changing water from liquid to vapor. The water vapor will keep the heat trapped until it condenses into liquid again.\nConclusion If you\u0026rsquo;ve been debating on \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t have a window, how do I vent a portable AC unit?\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;ve given you a lot of alternatives that will assist you in properly venting your air conditioner and chilling your space without a window!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-vent-portable-ac-without-window/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUsing a window to vent your \u003ca href=\"/most-powerful-portable-air-conditioners/\"\u003eportable air conditioner\u003c/a\u003e is the simplest method, but not every room in your home has access to a window.

Here’s how you can do it:\nQuick answer: To install a wood stove in a mobile home, get a mobile home-approved wood stove model. Then, drill a hole through the roof where you insert a double-layered pipe or a firebox. Then, connect the pipe to your wood stove and mount the stove’s feet to the floor.\nOptionally, add tiles to the walls surrounding your wood stove.\nHow to install a wood stove in your mobile home Here are the steps:\nRequirements: Get a mobile home-approved wood stove Before you buy a wood stove for your mobile home, ensure it is mobile home approved. Now, the likelihood of something ever happening, even when you install a non-approved wood stove in your mobile home, is small.\nHowever, just in case, and for insurance reasons, I highly suggest getting a mobile home-approved stove.\nMy philosophy with this is that having an approved stove might cost you a few bucks more. Or it takes you a little more time to find one. However, not having an approved stove can cost you your existence in case your mobile home ever catches fire.\nIn case neighboring buildings or a forest nearby catch fire, it gets even worse. The risk-to-benefit ratio leans totally toward getting a proper stove before you start.\nTrust me.\nA list of approved wood stoves is available from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Here’s a summary:\nWood stove modelBTU ratingPossible heating areaLeyden Top Loading73,100 BTU/h2,000 square feetLopi Endeavor72,400 BTU/h1,200 to 2,000 square feetLopi Answer66,800 BTU/h750 to 1,400 square feetLopi Liberty74,300 BTU/h1,500 to 2,500 square feet\nDecide the location of the wood stove After choosing and getting the right wood stove model, the next step to take is picking the right location in your mobile home.\nA wood stove generally needs \u0026gt;3 inches of space from your mobile home’s walls. That’s the first consideration.\nSo, pick a spacious location. Preferably a corner of your mobile home dedicated to your wood stove.\nAfter you know where the wood stove is being placed, you should determine the exact location of where the wood stove pipe goes through the roof (or wall).\nIf your wood stove pipe goes through the roof, then you can determine the location where the pipe passes by hanging a weighted string from the roof.\nYou can add weight to a string by tying a nut, a screw, or something similar to it.\nThe string hanging straight down (thanks to gravity) tells you exactly where you should drill through in the doof. You just have to make sure that the lower-hanging weighted end of the string marks the wood stove’s pipe opening.\nIf the location in the roof has any structurally important parts such as studs or cables, then you should consider moving the entire stove a few inches to the side, where there’s no barrier in the roof.\nMark the spot you drill through in the roof.\nOptional: Add tiles to the walls surrounding the wood stove To protect your mobile home’s walls against heat coming from the wood stove, you can add tiles.\nIt looks nice and the tiles will absorb some of the heat.\nThis will, however, incur some extra costs.\nBut it’s usually not necessary as long as you have a mobile home-approved wood stove. These usually radiate very little heat from their backside.\nSo, protecting your walls with tiles is optional.\nInstall the chimney Now that you’ve got your wood stove prepared, and you marked the pipe location in your mobile home’s roof, you can start the cutting!\nInstall your mobile home-approved wood stove’s pipe by cutting a hole in the ceiling. Additionally, most stoves come with a firebox which is inserted in the roof opening for fire protection which you will have to install. The hole you are cutting should match the dimensions of the firebox kit that is included with the wood stove.\nIf your wood stove comes without such a firebox, then I recommend either buying one or at least taking careful precautions to ensure your pipe won’t start a fire. For example, you can use a double-walled pipe from a hardware store for the pipe section passing through the roof.\nThis is almost as good!\nFor cutting, you can use a drywall saw or an electric wood saw. Both work the same. However, the drywall saw will be a little less messy.\nAfter preparing the chimney hole, you will have to insert the wood stove’s pipe. Be cautious about inserting the pipe with the right side up!\nHere’s a quote I found below a YouTube video:\n“Be careful about inserting the stove pipe going upward, into the next section. That way, creosote leaks backward thru the joint, and drips into your home. Always install a stove pipe inserting the top section into the lower section. That way the creosote will drip back into the inside of the pipe, and be self-contained.”\nInstall the wood stove and connect pipes The hardest part is done.\nTo install a wood stove in a mobile home, you will have to connect the stove’s pipe opening to the opening in your room.\nIf you set up the roof opening with accuracy, then installing the wood stove is a simple plugging of the pipe.\nIf necessary, you can tighten the pipe with a pipe-tightening ring. However, I’d recommend doing this only if the pipes connect very loosely.\nIf your mobile home wood stove’s pipe connects tightly and securely, you won’t need additional tightening.\nThe heat coming from the wood stove will soon further improve the pipe joints.\nMount the stove to the floor If you move your mobile home around a lot, then you should mount the stove’s feet to your mobile home’s floor.\nThis can be as simple as mounting a few screws. If your wood stove does not have openings or handles for such mounts, then you can build your own mounting construction.\nI’d recommend something like a metal piece that’s bent over the wood stove’s feet and screwed into the floor. Or you can build a more elaborate wood construction that stops the stove from moving around in your mobile home.\nIt all depends on your design preferences and how secure you want it to be.\nCost of installing a mobile home wood stove On average, a mobile home wood stove kit will cost you $1,200. Oftentimes, this includes the pipe. For the pipe, you should calculate an extra $100. So, you can expect to pay around $1,300 for your mobile home wood stove.\nIf you hire someone to install it for you, you can assume an additional $500 on top of that.\nHowever, most mobile homeowners don’t hire anyone and prefer to do their own installations.\nYou can get wood stove pipes from all regular hardware stores. There are no specific requirements that wood stove pipes must fulfill in your mobile home. It can be a regular wood stove pipe.\nWill your mobile home insurance rate increase after installing a wood stove? It can be that your insurance will increase your insurance rate slightly after you install your mobile home wood stove.\nHowever, the rate increase is usually insignificant. And also, heating with wood usually pays for itself quickly, since it is the most cost-effective way of heating .\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-install-a-wood-stove-in-a-mobile-home/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou want to install a wood stove in your mobile home?

Is it safe?\nQuick answer: Yes, you can use a propane heater in an RV. However, the heater must be fully functional (ideally new) and its oxygen intake must be well-adjusted. Also, always ensure the propane heater stands firmly. If necessary, build an anti-tip-over construction.\nBut first, you must find the right portable propane heater for your motor home.\nWhat’s the Best Propane Heater for RVs? The best portable propane heater has to be efficient, super portable, and safe. Of course, you must factor in the size and heat output of the heater, but safety has to come above all else.\nAfter testing several portable propane heaters for indoor use, the best option for an RV was hands-down, the Mr. Heater Big Buddy . Mr. Heater brand is very popular when it comes to portable RV heaters because they are reasonably priced, safe, efficient, and durable.\nThe Big Buddy in particular is perfect for just about any motorhome size out there as it can pump out 4,000, 9,000, and 18,000 BTUs an hour and heat up to 225 sq. ft. in less than 15 minutes.\nIt is only 9 pounds heavy and 15 inches tall, making it easy to move around the rig.\nThe solid build of this portable heater is a big reason why it\u0026rsquo;s so popular. The knob is high quality and responsive, the handle is solid, and it has rubber legs, so it can\u0026rsquo;t slide around.\nThe Big Buddy also comes with an Oxygen Depletion Sensor and an accidental tip-over safety shut-off to ensure safety when used indoors. That’s worth gold, especially for RV usage.\nThe advantage of this heater over the Little Buddy is that it\u0026rsquo;s compatible with a bigger 20lb tank, so it lasts longer (up to 108h of continuous usage medium settings), and it can get way hotter when necessary.\nIf you want, you can turn your RV into a sauna using it…\nDo Propane Heaters Cause Fires in RVs? A propane heater can theoretically cause an RV fire, but it\u0026rsquo;s highly unlikely if you use it properly. A propane heater can only cause a fire if there\u0026rsquo;s a flammable item near it or if you use a combustible spray in the vicinity.\nLuckily, the best propane heaters, including the Mr. Heaters Big Buddy, have a tip-over safety shut-off that shuts off the heater when it falls.\nThat said, it\u0026rsquo;s important to shut off the heater before going to bed or leaving the RV. While the chances of a portable heater causing a fire are slim, you must keep an eye on it and ensure it’s well-adjusted and maintained.\nDo Propane Heaters Give Off Carbon Monoxide? Yes, any space heater that burns fuel can give off carbon monoxide . This includes propane heaters. However, carbon monoxide emissions will only occur if the heater is improperly adjusted or broken.\nCarbon monoxide occurs because of the incomplete combustion of fuel such as propane, wood, and kerosene. This could be because there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough oxygen in the room to cause an ideal burn or the heater is not working properly.\nThere have been instances where a heater was knocked over, and something broke inside without the owner\u0026rsquo;s knowledge.\nAnd since carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, the only way to tell if your heater is emitting any is to have carbon monoxide detectors in the RV or keep a close eye on the heater itself.\nWhen a portable propane heater is not working properly or burning propane to completion, you will notice the flame is orange or yellow instead of blue, and some soot will start collecting inside. The heater will also cause more condensation than usual, which is usually the first sign people notice when the heater starts malfunctioning.\nSafety Tips for Using Propane Heaters in an RV A portable propane heater can cause a fire or produce carbon monoxide if you don’t take these safety precautions.\nPlace the Heater on the Floor A portable heater must sit on a stable level surface, preferably the floor, where the chances of falling are slim. It should also be out of high-traffic areas or somewhere it can be knocked over accidentally.\nEnsure there is nothing near the heater, or at least nothing flammable. And if you have kids or pets in the RV, keep the heater out of their reach but still on the floor.\nPark the RV on Solid Ground Again, the heater needs to be stable and level. Park the camper exchanging on solid ground (not slanted or shaky), preferably at an elevation of below 7,000 ft. Parking the RV too high reduces the amount of oxygen you get inside, which can lead to incomplete combustion.\nWhen driving, make sure the heater is placed in a way it can’t tip over. Again, falling can break adjustment causing improper burn and carbon monoxide.\nRegularly Vent the Room Any room that uses a propane heater must be well-ventilated. Crank the windows and door open during the day to allow moisture and any harmful gases to leave. Ventilation also allows more oxygen to get into the room, which is good for achieving that ideal burn.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also important to have good ventilation when the heater is on, even if it\u0026rsquo;s nighttime and chilly. Propane heaters use up a lot of oxygen, leaving the rest of you with limited air to breathe.\nMonitor the Heater I recommend keeping a close eye on anything burning fuel indoors. Other than that, installing carbon monoxide detectors and oxygen sensors in the RV also helps a lot. These sensors will alert you if oxygen levels in the room go below normal and if there\u0026rsquo;s any carbon monoxide in the air.\nHow to Refill Propane Heaters on the Road A 20-lb propane tank will heat an average-size camper RV for a week on low settings. On maximum settings, it will last for 24h.\nBut nobody blasts full heat for 24h continuously.\nThis means you will have to refill the tank occasionally when you are on the road.\nThankfully, many refill stations and hardware stores that cater to RVs and campers refill propane tanks at a very low cost of $3-$4 per gallon. In other words, you can refill a 20-lb tank for around $15. Propane is the second cheapest way to heat a room without electricity, only next to a wood-burning stove.\nIf you are new to using propane heaters, I recommend letting the guy at the filling station refill it for you just to be safe. Alternatively, you can exchange the empty tank with a full one at major stores like Walmart or Lowes, but this costs a little bit more.\nConclusion A portable propane heater is the safest and cheapest way to heat an RV in cold weather off-grid.\nAll you have to do is practice safety precautions and keep the heater (and the propane tank) in good condition. The heater should be new, well-adjusted, and fully functional.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-use-a-propane-heater-in-an-rv/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA portable propane heater can be a source of fast, efficient heat during chilly nights and winter months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut can you use a portable propane heater in an RV?

Where should you set up the portable AC in your garage? Especially, when you don’t have a window, you’ll need some installation work. And how can you maximize the efficiency of your garage AC? This article will clarify all of these questions!\nQuick answer: The best portable air conditioner for garages is the Whynter ARC-14S. Because it’s a dual-hose AC, it’s very efficient when cooling hot garages. However, you will need a window fitting two hoses or you will need to drill two holes in your garage wall for installation. If that’s too much, get the recommended Black+Decker single-hose portable AC.\nBest Portable Air Conditioners for Garages Before we dive into the proper portable AC setup for garages, here are my recommendations:\n#1 Whynter ARC-14S (14,000 BTU cooling capacity) The Whynter ARC-14S(click here to view it on amazon) is a strong dual-hose portable AC. I’ve ranked this model #1 because it has a significantly higher efficiency than other portable ACs.\nGood efficiency helps you cut your electricity bill for garages, which are not ideally insulated. Regular portable ACs have just one hose that blows air out. This means somewhere air has to be sucked into the AC. And because there’s no second hose, the air from within your garage is sucked in and blown out. Get my point?\nSingle-hose portable ACs cool the air, and then blow that same cooled air outside.\nThe Whynter AC’s dual-hose system mimics the structure of a split AC. One hose is a waste heat hose. The other sucks in air from outside which is used for cooling.\nDual-hose portable ACs are technically superior to single-hose ACs. And that’s why I always rank them #1.\n#2 BLACK+DECKER Air Conditioner (14,000 BTU cooling capacity) The Black+Decker portable AC(click to view it on amazon) is a 14,000 BTU cooling capacity single-hose AC. It is rated with the same cooling capacity as my #1, the Whynter AC.\nHowever, because of the flaws of single-hose systems that I just explained, this portable AC has to consume more power to make up for the lack of efficiency.\nI’d suggest getting the Black+Decker AC over the Whynter AC only if you don’t have the opportunity (or don’t want) to connect two hoses to the window.\nEspecially, if you don’t have a window and you’ll have to drill a hole through your garage’s wall, getting a single-hose AC might be the better choice.\nIt’s better for the structural integrity of your garage (although two small holes won’t be a big problem). And it saves you installation time.\nSo: This Black+Decker portable AC will cool your garage just as well as the Whynter AC. Also, it’s easier to set up. However, it will consume more electricity.\n#3 SereneLife Portable AC (12,000 BTU) This SereneLife portable AC (click to view it on amazon) is a 12,000 BTU portable air conditioner. So, just by the cooling capacity rating, this model is around 14% weaker than the other recommendations.\nBut usually, you won’t notice the difference that much. Especially in 1,2 or even 3 car garages. This AC is still large enough.\nActually, I included this AC not because there is a technical reason that makes it a great AC for garages specifically, but rather because it has such a long track record of being sold. And I, personally, like products that are trusted.\nMost portable ACs work the same. This one is just another portable AC.\nWhat makes a portable AC suitable for garages? A portable AC for garages must be powerful because garages are oftentimes improperly insulated. In the summertime, garages heat up fast. And an AC has to be able to keep up with it.\nThat’s why I only included 14,000 BTU or 12,000 BTU ACs in the recommendations.\nIn general, I’d say you should prefer powerful over weak portable ACs.\nA powerful portable air conditioner can always reduce its cooling power when the desired temperature is reached (thanks to the built-in thermostat).\nA weak portable air conditioner, however, can not increase its cooling capacity if it’s not able to reach the target temperature.\nIt’s the same with cars: A strong-engine car can always drive slowly and efficiently. But a weak car can never drive fast.\nThat’s why I recommend getting a strong 14,000 BTU or 12,000 BTU portable AC for your garage. During the hottest weeks of the year, you’ll be happy about your decision.\nWhich air conditioner is best for large garages (3,4,5 cars) For large garages, a window air conditioner or a split AC is the best. They output even more cold air for the same amount of electricity. Window and split ACs have a higher cooling efficiency than portable ACs.\nBecause they don’t have these cheap hoses that portable ACs have and because the hot air-releasing part of the AC unit is always located outside, they don’t have the same efficiency problems as portable ACs.\nHow to improve portable air conditioner cooling power in a garage You can improve the cooling efficiency of your portable air conditioner by improving the insulation of your garage.\nHere are the steps you can take:\nSeal the gaps below your garage door: A lot of hot air enters the garage through the gaps below the garage door. Ensure they are properly sealed. You could use, for example, this Garage Door weather seal (click here to view it on amazon). Insulate the air conditioner hose: A portable AC blows waste heat outside through the attached hose. Since it’s usually made of plastic, it does not hold heat at all. By properly insulating the hose using an aluminum insulation wrap, you can decrease the amount of heat reentering your garage. I’ve written an article specifically about making portable ACs more efficient, so have a look here: How to make a portable AC more efficient\nCan you vent a portable AC through a garage door? Yes, you can vent a portable AC through a garage door. However, you’ll have to build the venting setup yourself. Portable AC garage door kits don’t exist.\nAt least I did not find any.\nI guess it has to do with the size of garage doors, which the garage door kit would have to cover. That’s not feasible mostly.\nYou can build your own venting construction by drilling a hole (for the waste heat hose) through a wood board. Then, you can connect the portable AC hose to the wood board vent.\nAnd then, you can insert it into the garage door gap and seal the open rest of the gap.\nYou can use aluminum wrap, styrofoam, or wood to seal the gaps. Using double layers further improves the insulation!\nHow and where to install a portable AC in a garage? In a garage, you can install your portable AC either directly to a drilled hole in the wall, or you can install it below a window (as it is intended).\nIn general, drilling your own vent has the advantage of not blocking your (potentially only) garage window.\nAlso, garage windows rarely are big enough to fit a portable AC window kit. Or the space below the garage window is already blocked.\nI find drilling a hole generally the best approach. But if your window allows it, installing it there is just as good.\nHow to install a portable air conditioner in your garage without a window? Locate any free spot in your garage. The best about drilling your own vent is that you can place it (almost) anywhere you like.\nAs a tool, you can use a hammer drill with a strong drilling bit.\nEnsure there is no wire or pipe running through the wall where you want to drill. You can use a wire and pipe detector for this. But you can also use your common sense. If there’s no sink or wall outlet around, the likelihood of damaging a wire or pipe is very small. Drill around 15 to 20 holes in a circle. The vent does not need to be as large a diameter as the AC hose. A small 3 inches hole is enough. Larger is of course better since this improves airflow. Knock the loose brick out. Mount a metal pipe through the hole that guides the air outside (so the waste heat is not absorbed by the garage wall) Mount the AC window kit which is included with the AC in front of the hole. You can glue the plastic to a wood construction and then mount the wood construction to your drilled venting hole. How to install a portable AC in a garage window To install a portable AC in a garage window, you can use the window kit included with the AC. If it doesn’t fit your garage window, you can build your own venting construction.\nIf you only have a small garage window, consider drilling your own vent instead. It’s easier to set up, does not block the window (and the sunlight), and you can place the vent anywhere you want.\nWhen you use a window as a vent, the placement of your portable AC is locked to the area around the window.\nIf you have multiple windows, then choose a window that’s closest to where you are spending the most time. This exposes you to the cold air coming out of the AC and reduces the perceived temperature in the garage for you.\nIs there an air conditioner that doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be vented? As a garage owner, you probably want to spare yourself the hassle of setting up an AC in your garage. But, a vent is necessary.\nAll air conditioners have to be vented. Any air conditioner that claims to need no vent is a marketing scam and has no technical foundation.\nAir conditioners absorb heat from a room. And the heat has to go somewhere. Now, if you don’t vent it, the heat will stay in your room and the temperature won’t change.\nWithout a vent, cooling is impossible.\nIt might be possible to change the perceived temperature of a room without a vent. For example, using a humidifier or a pedestal, or a floor fan. However, this does not reduce the actual temperature.\nIt only changes your feeling about the temperature.\nSo: If you want real air conditioning in your garage, you will have to set up a vent.\nWill a portable air conditioner work in a garage? Yes, all portable air conditioners will work in a garage given you set up a vent (through a window or a drilled hole in the wall).\nAlso, you have to ensure that your portable AC is properly sized for your garage.\nI could give you a list of garage sizes and required portable AC cooling capacities so you can pick the properly sized portable AC for your garage.\nHowever, I generally prefer stronger models over weaker models. A strong portable air conditioner will cool any garage size. While with a weak air conditioner you will only be able to cool small garages (meaning you will never be able to use the portable AC if you ever want to use it in a larger space).\nJust check the recommended portable air conditioners at the beginning of this article. They suit 99% of garages.\nAre there more methods to cool down my garage with no windows? If you have a garage without windows, you can’t set up proper air conditioning without drilling holes. Instead, you should use a floor fan.\nA floor fan can blow large amounts of air in a short time. It will reduce the perceived temperature in a garage.\nAlso, if your garage accumulates a lot of heat, a floor fan can wipe out the heated air within just a couple of minutes.\nI have an 80W floor fan (which is just a fraction of the wattage of a portable AC by the way) and I am able to cool down my entire living space in early summer mornings or late nights using it.\nFloor fans are incredibly cost-effective.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-portable-air-conditioners-for-garage/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhat are the best portable air conditioners for garages?

Here’s how to fix it.\nQuick answer: To fix a portable AC not turning on, check fuses and circuit breakers. Ensure the wall outlet is powered. Check clogged air filters and the drain pan. Check for internal ice buildup and verify that compressor and ducts are sealed.\nDon’t worry! For each of those causes, I’ll tell you exactly how to check it and which steps to take to fix it. Let’s go one by one.\nPossible reasons and fixes for a portable AC not turning on There are different possible causes for your portable AC not turning on. Here’s a list of them sorted by likelihood (first is most likely, last is least likely).\nGo through the list one by one. The most important part of each list item is the “How to check” section. It helps you identify the cause of your portable AC not turning on. The “How to fix” section helps you fix it!\n#1 Blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker in the electric grid There are two spots where fuses or circuit breakers can trip: Either in the portable AC directly, or in your home’s electric grid.\nThe likeliest place for a fuse to trip is your home’s electric grid. It can be that your electric circuit can’t handle the portable AC’s current draw.\nHow to check: Locate your home’s electric service panel and check whether a breaker tripped. Also, check for blown fuses. Maybe they are located inside the same electric service panel. But you might also have a separate fuse box (especially in older houses). How to fix: If a circuit breaker tripped, you can just switch it back to the ‘turned on’ position.\nIn case you locate a blown fuse, you first have to identify the fuse model and the amperage (it’s usually written on the casing of the fuse). Then, buy an identically rated fuse online or in a local hardware store to replace it. Don’t worry, it’s simple. Have a quick look on YouTube, if you don’t know how to do it yet. #2 Defective (or unpowered) wall outlet It might be that the wall outlet you connect your portable AC to is broken.\nHow to check: Connect another electronic device to the wall outlet and see if it powers on. Alternatively, move the portable AC to another wall outlet and see if it turns on there. How to fix: To fix a defective wall outlet, locate the right circuit breaker in your electric service panel and turn the power off first. Then, you can check the wall outlet for loose or broken connections or molten parts.\nIf you are not comfortable fixing a wall outlet, just hire an electrician. That’s an everyday task for them. #3 Blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker inside the portable AC In the power module of a portable AC, there is at least one fuse. Actually, that’s the case for every heavy-duty appliance. It might be that your specific model alternatively has a built-in circuit breaker (but that’s less likely).\nBlown fuses or tripped circuit breakers inside a portable AC are not as probable, because a portable AC should never draw more power than it needs. And the circuitry inside it is designed to handle the amperage it draws.\nHow to check: Unplug the portable AC from the wall outlet. Open the casing and locate the power module. Usually, it’s close to the spot the power cord connects to. The power module is an electric circuit board that looks similar to the image below.\nOn this power module, see if the fuse is blown. If you can’t find a fuse, look for a circuit breaker switch (which you can just switch back on). How to fix: Replace the broken fuse. Usually, the fuse sits in a push-in system. In that case, you can just take it out. If the fuse is soldered in, you’ll need a soldering iron and solder wick to remove the fuse.\nCheck the amperage rating that’s engraved on the fuse and buy an identically rated replacement. Put in the new fuse to complete the fix. #4 Clogged air filters and filled drain pan Portable ACs need maintenance! If the air filters are clogged or the drain pan is filled, it might cause the portable AC to stop turning on. There could be safety sensors that detect water and dust buildup.\nHow to check: Open the portable AC and check the air filters. Also, check the drain pan for water. How to fix: Clean the air filters using a dry brush (do not use water when cleaning air filters, as this will result in smelly air conditioning). Also, drain the water using the small drain pipe on the back of your portable AC. #5 Condenser or evaporator coil filled with dirt A condenser or an evaporator coil filled with dirt prevents a portable AC from turning on. The evaporator coil absorbs the heat from the indoor air. The condenser releases the heat from the refrigerant. A fan then blows the heat away from it. When there’s dirt on your condenser or evaporator coil, the heat absorption won’t properly work. A sensor could stop the AC from turning on due to this.\nHow to check: Open your portable AC. Locate the condenser and the evaporator coil. How to fix: Clean the AC’s condenser and evaporator coil. I recommend this evaporator coil cleaning foam (click here to view it on amazon) for this. #6 Ice buildup inside If you’ve been running your portable AC on maximum settings for a few hours continuously, it might be that ice builds up inside.\nThe ice buildup could damage the electronic circuitry inside.\nHow to check: Open your portable AC and check the area around the compressor. Do you see any ice? How to fix: Wait for a few hours for the ice to melt. You can also try scraping the ice off the compressor. Also, make sure that the melting ice does not drip into the electronics. After melting, wait for a few more hours to let the humidity leave the AC.\nTry turning your portable AC on after it is completely dried. #7 Broken Compressor or leaking ducts A broken compressor or leaking ducts are the worst things that can happen to an AC. A broken compressor is hard to fix. Either you can’t open it. Or, your fix would impact the efficiency because you increase irregularities inside the compressor.\nLeaking ducts can be closed, but the problem is recharging the refrigerant properly, which is better done by a professional.\nHow to check: Check for visual impacts or tears in the compressor or ducts in your open portable AC. If you can’t see anything and your AC doesn’t turn on, then it’s hard to detect.\nBut if your AC turns on, but the compressor does not work, then you might be able to hear a hissing sound coming from the compressor or the ducts. How to fix: Fixing a broken compressor or leaking ducts is not worth it. Instead, get a new portable AC. What should you do if your portable AC won’t turn on? When your portable AC doesn’t turn on, I generally recommend either getting a new portable AC or rethinking your air conditioning.\nFixing a broken portable AC is rarely worth the time and effort it takes. If the cause for your portable AC is an easy-to-fix one (such as a blown fuse), then sure, fix it!\nBut oftentimes, the time and effort are not worth it.\nI’d say a broken portable AC is an opportunity to think about whether your next AC really has to be a portable one.\nWhat’s a reliable AC to replace a broken portable AC? The most reliable replacement for a broken portable AC is a window AC. In general, you should prefer window ACs over portable ACs.\nThe reason is that window ACs are much more efficient as they don’t have the same technical design flaws a portable AC has.\nWindow ACs provide up to twice the cooling capacity while still consuming about the same amount of electricity.\nWindow ACs don’t come with trashy hoses and you won’t need a window hose kit to install them. Also, window ACs last a lot longer.\nMy recommendation: Get this window AC (click here to view it on amazon) to replace your broken portable air conditioner. And care for it (no more dirt and moisture buildup).\nThen, it’ll last you for decades!\nHowever, if you need a portable AC, then check this article: 3 Most Powerful Portable Air Conditioners. It lists the (in my opinion) best and most reliable portable ACs.\nCan a professional repair a broken portable AC? Yes, a professional can repair a broken portable AC. However, a professional will usually charge you at least $100 - $200 for the fix. For old portable ACs, that’s more than the resell value.\nYou can also spend that money on a new AC instead.\nBy the way: If you are low on funds, you can also buy portable ACs used! Just look for one on eBay or craigslist and you’ll find something in your area. Maybe you can even get it with shipping.\nHow to safely repair a portable AC not turning on To repair a portable air conditioner not turning on safely, you should always ensure that it’s not plugged into the wall outlet.\nTo reduce the risk of electric shock, leave it for a minute after unplugging it. This discharges capacitors in the electric circuitry.\nIn the meantime, touch a radiator, a bathtub, or a sink to discharge yourself. This prevents electric discharges from your body to the portable AC’s electronics, which can damage sensitive components.\nOnly then you should open the AC to check for and fix problems.\nWhat to do if your portable AC does not work well after the fix? If your portable AC turns on but does not work well after fixing it, I recommend replacing it with a new one.\nThe moisture and dirt buildup might have left permanent damage to the circuitry.\nIn that case, you can check once again that everything is properly cleaned (using the evaporator coil cleaner) and try running the portable AC again.\nBut if it still does not work, it is probably permanently damaged.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-portable-ac-not-turning-on/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour portable AC won’t turn on?

One Honeywell portable AC even has 15,000 BTU of cooling power. However, it’s almost always out of stock.\nToo bad, Honeywell.\nQuick answer: The most powerful portable air conditioner is a 15,000 BTU AC by Honeywell. However, this model is always out of stock. Instead, the 14,000 BTU dual-hose Whynter ARC-14S provides the most powerful and efficient cooling. If that is not enough for you, you should get a 25,000 BTU window air conditioner instead.\nKeep reading to see the recommendations! After listing the 3 most powerful portable air conditioners, I will also recommend a more powerful window air conditioner toward the end of this article.\nAnd you will learn how you can maximize the power efficiency of your portable AC!\nRecommendations: 3 Powerful Portable Air Conditioners Here are my personal recommendations:\n#1 Whynter ARC-14S (14,000 BTU) The Whynter ARC-14S (click here to view it on amazon) provides the most cooling power for the least money. Technically, it is a highly efficient portable air conditioner as it is a dual-hose system, which mimics the inner workings of a real split AC.\nRegular ACs have only one hose which blows hot exhaust air outside. This, however, creates a negative pressure in your room which sucks additional hot air into your room.\nThe second hose of the Whynter portable AC sucks air from outside, instead of from your room, which makes it a LOT more efficient (and accordingly more powerful) than any single-hose portable AC.\nThat’s why I ranked this 14,000 BTU portable air conditioner as the most powerful and my personal recommendation!\n#2 BLACK+DECKER Air Conditioner (14,000 BTU) Even though there are hundreds of 14,000 BTU portable air conditioners to choose from, this Black+Decker portable AC (click to view it on amazon) is a model you can rely on.\nThis model has been around for years, and most people love it. It has over 40,000 reviews on amazon. That’s a number!\nTo be honest, the cooling capacity of this portable AC is 14,000 BTUs which is not any more or less powerful than other 14,000 BTU ACs. Nevertheless, since 14,000 BTU is (with one exception) the maximum cooling capacity of portable ACs, I had to choose one among a huge range of portable ACs. So, I went for the most trusted model. And this is definitely the number 1 portable AC online.\nStill, it’s a single-hose system. So, for the 14,000 BTU you get out of this AC, you will have to invest more electric power. In comparison to the Whynter ARC-14S (the number #1 in this list), this air conditioner will either consume more power (meaning a higher electricity bill), or output less cold air (depending on how the manufacturer measured the 14,000 BTU rating).\nIt’s a proven AC, but it’s technically inferior when compared to a dual-hose model.\n#3 Honeywell HJ5CESWK0 (15,000 BTU) Ranked third place, but actually the most powerful of all portable air conditioners is the Honeywell HJ5CESWK0.\nThis portable air conditioner only makes it to #3, because it’s just always out of stock. I don’t care about an AC with the supposedly biggest cooling power if I can’t even buy that product.\nAnd the difference to the readily available 14,000 BTU ACs is only marginal. In cooling capacity, 15,000 BTU is just 7.14% more than 14,000 BTU.\nThat’s not a lot. Especially considering other factors such as the portable ACs insulation, which has a much more significant impact on cooling power than the measly 7.14% BTU increase.\nWhat are the most powerful portable air conditioners? Now that we’ve checked the 3 most powerful portable air conditioners, this section deals with the WHY. Why did I choose these portable air conditioners and not any other models?\nExperiment: Finding 5 powerful portable air conditioners ranked by BTU Before I knew what the most powerful portable air conditioners are, I had to check products online. Here’s an excerpt of the most powerful portable ACs that I found (3 of them made it to the recommendations).\nModel****Cooling CapacityHoneywell HJ5CESWK015,000 BTUWhynter ARC-14S14,000 BTUBLACK+DECKER Air Conditioner14,000 BTUDe\u0026rsquo;Longhi Pinguino14,000 BTUSereneLife SLPAC12.512,000 BTU\nAs you see, most portable air conditioners have a maximum cooling capacity of 14,000 BTU.\nLooking up different portable AC models, I found that the range is usually between 6,000 BTU and 14,000 BTU. Some models are even weaker than 6,000 BTU.\nBut all models have this 14,000 BTU limit in common.\nI am curious…\nWhat is the biggest portable air conditioner size? The biggest portable air conditioner is the Honeywell HJ5CESWK0. It has a cooling capacity of 15,000 BTU. The Honeywell portable air conditioner is however always out of stock.\nThe biggest readily available portable air conditioners provide 14,000 BTU of cooling power.\nApparently, there is a limit to how strong portable air conditioners can be.\nI guess that it has something to do with efficiency. As an engineer, you can’t increase the cooling capacity of a portable AC indefinitely. At some point, the flaws of portable air conditioners annihilate the additional electric power you invest.\nFor example, portable air conditioners blow the waste air out the window using a plastic hose. That plastic hose is, however, so thin, that it hardly provides any insulation.\nThe more a portable air conditioner cools, the hotter the hot waste air gets. The problem is now the following:\nHotter air penetrates insulation much faster than colder air. That’s why at a certain cooling capacity, the heat re-entering the room will cancel out the cold air produced by the AC.\nSo, building portable air conditioners more powerful than 14,000 BTU is not worth it. Maybe they don’t even get certified because they get more and more inefficient… Who knows?\nHow much power does a 14,000 BTU portable AC consume? A 14,000 BTU AC consumes around 1,500W on high settings. That’s an hourly running cost of $0.21 assuming an average electricity rate of $0.14 per kWh.\nIf your electricity rate is higher, you can just increase the running cost proportionally.\nAlso, the 1,500W is just an average.\nThe exact wattage depends on your climate zone and the size of your room.\nYou can assume the following corrections depending on the climate:\nClimate zone****AC Wattage1 (tropic)2250 Watts2 (hot)2000 Watts3 (warm - moderate)1750 Watts4 (mild - moderate)1500 Watts5 (mild)1250 Watts6 (cool)1000 Watts7 (cold)750 Watts\nYou can look up your exact climate zone in the IECC climate zone map below:\nWhat’s the most powerful window air conditioner? Do you really need a portable air conditioner? Does it really have to be a portable one? Because for (almost) anyone who has access to a window, a window AC could also be worth considering.\nWhy? Because window ACs are a lot more powerful than portable air conditioners.\nRecommendation: This 25,000 BTU Frigidaire Window Air Conditioner (click to view it on amazon)\nThe best thing about window ACs is that they don’t use much (if any) more electric power than a portable air conditioner. However, window ACs provide up to 2-3x the cooling power.\nThe reason is that window ACs don’t have the design flaws present in portable ACs we talked about earlier. Window ACs are actual, real, and solid air conditioners.\nPortable air conditioners have significant efficiency issues.\nSo, if you have a window in the room you want to cool and you have the funds to buy a window AC, then please think about it.\nWith a window AC, you get much more cooling power for your money’s worth. And in the long run, a window AC will even save you money because of the increased efficiency.\nPersonally, I’d always prefer window ACs.\nUnfortunately, the window type I have in my home does not allow window ACs (I have tilting instead of shifting windows).\nHow to build a powerful portable air conditioner based on a window AC 14,000 or even 15,000 BTU is not enough cooling capacity for you? Well, since this is the absolute ceiling of portable air conditioner power, we have to think of something else for you.\nIn the previous section, we have already checked window air conditioners. These are air conditioners that are supposed to be placed in a window.\nBut what if you don’t have a window? Or you don’t want a non-portable window air conditioner?\nIf you are technically a bit capable (able to stick some pipes together, etc.), then you can transform a window air conditioner into a portable air conditioner.\nYou can buy a 25,000 BTU window AC and transform it into a 25,000 BTU portable AC.\nCheck this guide: Can you use a window air conditioner without a window? (I tell you exactly how to use a window AC as if it was portable there)\nHowever, there’s one drawback: By making a window air conditioner portable, you essentially introduce all the design flaws and efficiency problems of portable air conditioners to your window AC.\nThis results in a significant cooling power cut. You won’t be able to build a 25,000 BTU portable air conditioner easily. After installing a hose, the cooling capacity might cut down to 20,000 BTU or even 15,000 BTU.\nHowever, you can raise the cooling capacity again by spending extra attention to proper insulation and tightly sealing everything.\nIt’s a bit of a mess and a fight against physics.\nThis section is just to give you ideas. It is possible, but it will be a several-day-lasting project. You will have to enjoy it.\nI’d stick to regular portable or window ACs.\nHow to increase the cooling power of a portable AC To get the most power out of a regular portable air conditioner, you have to add additional insulation. The most important upgrade is wrapping the exhaust hose in an aluminum wrap (or any other insulation material). Additionally, you can install your own second hose to convert your single-hose AC to a dual-hose system.\nBut that requires a bit of fiddling around and maybe handyman knowledge.\nRead this guide for more: How to make a portable AC more efficient?\nConclusion Using the terms “portable AC” and “powerful” in one sentence is not common.\nThe most powerful portable air conditioners have 15,000 BTU or 14,000 BTU of cooling power. There appears to be a technical limit of the achievable cooling power of portable ACs.\nIf you need more power than that, I highly recommend getting a window air conditioner.\nWindow air conditioners do not have the efficiency problems that portable air conditioners have. They work just like regular ACs and provide a lot more cooling power for the same money.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/most-powerful-portable-air-conditioners/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe most powerful portable air conditioners are 14,000 BTU.

Why is that?\nIn this article, we’re going to find this out!\nQuick answer: On regular US 120V wall outlets you can run two space heaters at once on reduced heating settings only (80% or less). On 220V-240V (eg. UK, Europe) power outlets you can run two space heaters on full power since more voltage means less amperage which means less tripping of circuit breakers.\nWhile all other blogs on the web just do calculations, I simply tried running my two space heaters at once. Did a circuit breaker trip? Here’s the result:\nAnswer: Can you run two space heaters at once? Here’s the answer to whether you can run two space heaters simultaneously in your home. If you have a 15A circuit, check the first table. For 20A circuits, check the second table.\nThen look up the power of your heaters and see in the ‘Can you run two heaters’ columns whether you can run your heater.\nUse the 120V column if you live in North America Use the 230V column if you live in Europe, the UK, or Australia For 15A circuits: Heater power****Can you run two heaters?

The heaters recommended in this article are safe to run simultaneously.\nCheck the article, if you live in the US and you are looking for the right heater!\nExperiment: I tried to run two space heaters simultaneously Before crunching any numbers, I decided to test whether I can run two space heaters simultaneously myself.\nI am a proud owner of two space heaters. One is a 2,500W oil-filled radiator. The other is an 800W infrared heater. So, both together are able to deliver a total heat output of 3300W. That’s quite a number.\nMost space heaters run on 1,500W. So, the 3,300W combined from my space heaters is even more than running two regular 1,500W heaters.\nExperiment Result: What happens when I run two space heaters at once? NOTHING.\nThe heaters turned on. They started heating. No fuses or circuit breakers were harmed in the making of this experiment. Literally, nothing happened. The two space heaters ran as if nothing special was going on.\nWhy am I able to run two space heaters at once? I live in Europe. In Europe, in the UK, and, actually, in most countries of the world, the wall outlets provide 230V of power. In the US it’s a measly 120V.\nThe more power we receive through voltage, the less current (amperage) is required. Less current requires a lower wire gauge, which makes it less likely to blow fuses and trip circuit breakers.\nMy two space heaters draw a combined amperage of 3300W/240V = 13.75A.\nThis is well below the 15A (or 20A) limit most circuit breakers have.\nAnd that’s why I am able to run two space heaters on full power.\nSorry, America!\nNow, we know that almost all outlets in the world can handle two space heaters simultaneously. Let’s check the situation for 120V US outlets.\nWill 2 space heaters trip the circuit breaker? One 1,500W space heater draws 12.5A on a 120V wall outlet. A regular circuit breaker trips at 15A - 20A.\nSo, one space heater can always run on full power.\nTwo space heaters will trip the circuit breaker if both heaters run on full power. They won’t trip the circuit breaker if they run on reduced power.\nIt does not matter whether you achieve the reduced power by reducing both space heater’s power settings, or by reducing one space heater’s power setting a lot and running the other on full power.\nThe only metric that matters for tripping circuit breakers is the combined power consumption (and, therefore, the amperage) of both heaters.\nCan you run two space heaters on one circuit? Yes, you can run two space heaters on one circuit, if each space heater draws less than half the amperage your circuit is rated for.\nIf your circuit is 20 Amps, then each space heater should draw less than 10 Amps.\nA 1,500W space heater draws 12.5A. Therefore, you have to reduce the heating setting by at least 20% so it draws only 10A.\nThen, two space heaters will draw 20A combined and you can run them on one circuit.\nFor a 15A circuit, you should reduce the amperage of each space heater to 7.5A. That’s a reduction of the heat setting by 40%.\nAs a rule of thumb: You can run two space heaters on a 15A circuit only if you run each space heater at half power settings.\nNote that you can’t run any other devices in that case, since that would overload your home’s circuit.\nHow many space heaters can I run on a 20-amp breaker? On a 20-amp breaker, you can run 2 space heaters on 80% heating settings, or 3 space heaters on 50% heating settings.\nHowever, the total power output of a 120V outlet is capped at 2400W, so you can never produce more heat than 2,400W, and adding more space heaters (on lower settings) won’t make a difference.\nYou can check the specifications of your space heater to see how much you need to reduce the heating settings in order to safely run your space heater without tripping the breaker.\nHow many watts can I run on a 20-amp circuit? On a 20-amp circuit, you can run a total of 20 amps × 120 volts = 2400 watts.\nHow many watts can I run on a 15-amp circuit? On a 20-amp circuit, you can run a total of 15 amps × 120 volts = 1800 watts.\nHow many amps does a 1500-watt heater take? A 1,500W space heater draws 12.5A from the wall outlet. You get this result by dividing the wattage by the voltage.\n1,500W ÷ 120V = 12.5A.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-run-two-space-heaters-at-once/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou can run two space heaters at once almost anywhere in the world except in the US.

It also affects the efficiency, cost, noise, and installation cost of the different AC types.\nQuick answer: Window ACs are window-mounted, low-cost, but noisy. Split ACs are wall-mounted, rather expensive, but more powerful and quiet. Both window and split ACs have a similar cooling efficiency. Technically they are equally capable of cooling large rooms.\nIn this article, we’re going to compare window and split air conditioners. After reading this article, you’ll know which one is better for you.\nComparison Table: Is a Window AC or a Split AC better? MetricWindow ACSplit AC**Price$300 - $600$1,000 - $3,000Installation cost**$313$1,000Cooling Capacity5,000 - 12,000 BTU/h18,000 - 30,000 BTU/hEfficiencyhighhighDIY installation possibleyesonly for the experiencedNoise level69dB - 72dB50dB - 60dBLooksBig appliance in your window (ugly)Still a big appliance, but outside of your field of view (subtle)\nIn short, as you can see from the values from the table, a split AC is better in terms of cooling power and low noise levels. However, it costs more.\nA window AC is louder and does not cool as much (however, still enough for regular-sized living rooms). But it is a lot more affordable!\nIf you have to think whether you can afford a split AC, you probably can’t (that’s something I tell myself often as a rule of thumb). In this case, I’d opt for a window AC.\nIf you can afford a split AC, get one.\nRecommended Products: Window and Split AC Before we dive deeper into the window and split AC comparisons, let me just list two air conditioners that I want to recommend to you. Both are available online, so you don’t need to pay the price markup you would get at an HVAC company.\nRecommended Window AC (10,000 BTU cooling capacity)\nI recommend this 10,000 BTU Midea window AC (click here to see it on amazon). It comes in smaller cooling capacity (BTU) sizes as well, if you want to save some money.\nI prefer the bigger variants of air conditioners in general because they are (usually) more efficient and you get more value per dollar spent.\nRecommended Split AC (18,000 BTU cooling capacity)\nMostly, you buy spit ACs together with installation from an HVAC company. If you want to save the installation cost and install the AC unit yourself, then I recommend this 18,000 BTU MRCOOL Split AC system (click here to view it on amazon).\nWith 18,000 BTUs, this AC is very powerful. And that’s already a general observation we can make: Split ACs are usually more powerful than window ACs.\nWhat are the Differences between a Window and Split AC? Cooling Capacity Window ACs usually come with the following cooling capacities:\n5,000 BTU/h 6,000 BTU/h 8,000 BTU/h 10,000 BTU/h 12,000 BTU/h Meanwhile, I’ve found the following cooling capacities for split ACs:\n12,000 BTU/h 18,000 BTU/h 23,000 BTU/h 34,500 BTU/h The average window AC provides 10,000 BTUs of cooling capacity while the average split AC provides well over 20,000 BTUs of cooling capacity.\nSurely, there will be some window ACs that are more powerful than some split AC models. However, a good universally valid statement is:\nOn average, split ACs provide more cooling capacity than window ACs. Window ACs are, however, not technically inferior. Split ACs are just larger and heavier devices that also consume more power.\nIt’s like comparing a truck with a regular family sedan.\nEfficiency Efficiency-wise, window ACs and split ACs are equal. There is no technical difference that causes an efficiency advantage for one or the other. Rather, any difference in efficiency is model-specific.\nYou can expect both window ACs and split ACs to have good cooling efficiency.\nThe reason is that both window and split ACs have the condenser located outside of your house. The extracted heat is led outdoors.\nSome ACs such as portable ACs have the condenser inside the AC unit standing in your living space. The AC unit has to blow the heat outdoors through a hose. Because the hose is usually poorly insulated, some of the heat reenters the room.\nYou don’t have these kinds of efficiency problems with a window or split AC.\nPrice You can expect to pay at least 2-3x for split ACs when compared to a window AC. However, split ACs also provide proportionally more cooling capacity.\nPer BTU of cooling capacity, the price of window ACs and split ACs is about the same.\nHowever, with split ACs you will have to account for higher installation costs.\nInstallation effort \u0026amp; cost Drilling holes in a wall, connecting the split parts of a split AC, and maybe even installing ducts is not the same as simply placing an appliance in a window.\nInstalling split ACs is significantly more expensive than installing a window AC.\nInstalling a split AC requires commitment and handyman knowledge. Meanwhile, almost everybody can install a window AC with the help of a manual or a video.\nOf course, you can hire an HVAC professional for the installation.\nInstalling a split ac costs $300 - $6000 depending on the AC system. For a single split AC unit, it’s usually under $1,000. The $6,000 is only for complex multi-zone AC systems.\nInstalling a window AC costs on average $313 with a range of $139 a $527.\nNoise The noise level of the outdoor part of a window and split air conditioner is between 69-72dB. However, split and window ACs differ significantly in their indoor noise levels.\nBecause a window AC is mounted in a window, which has low sound insulation, the indoor noise level of a window AC is 50dB to 70dB, depending on the type of window.\nThe outdoor component of a split AC is separated through a wall. So your indoors is very quiet with about 50dB to 60dB.\nNote that in Decibels (dB), an increase of 3dB doubles the loudness. For example, 53dB is twice as loud as 50dB. So, the difference between split and window AC noise is significant.\nA window AC is 3 times as loud as a split AC.\nConclusion: Split AC or Window AC? Which one should you get? In general, prefer split ACs if you have the funds and if you can afford proper installation.\nIf you don’t have the funds or need a rather portable and cheap device, get a window AC.\nBoth split ACs and window ACs are well worth their money.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/whats-the-difference-between-window-ac-and-split-ac/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWindow ACs and Split ACs differ in their internal structure.

For hot yoga, it’s critical that the heater\ndoes not auto shut-off heats to the desired temperature Quick answer: The best space heaters for Hot Yoga are the Mr. Heater Big Buddy (propane heater) or the Dr. Infrared Heater. Both heat quickly, don’t turn off and provide enough power to get small rooms to 100°F.\nThe problem with most space heaters is that they turn off before reaching the 100°F necessary for hot yoga.\nHere are my recommendations. Only one heater can provide the full 100°F. However, for the other two heaters, I am going to tell you exactly how you can reach your desired temperature at the end of this article. So, stick out and read the full post!\nRecommendations: 5 Best Space Heaters for Hot Yoga Here are the 3 best space heaters for hot yoga.\n#1 Mr. Heater Big Buddy (propane, 100°F) The Mr. Heater Big Buddy is a propane heater that can easily heat your room to over 100°F. It has a heat capacity of up to 18,000 BTUs, which is 3 times as strong as regular electric space heaters.\nThe Mr. Heater Big Buddy produces the most heat of all the heaters on this list. However, since it is a propane heater, you can’t just run it electrically.\nYou have to get refill propane. A regular 20-lb propane tank lasts for a full 108h on low settings on this heater.\nOn the highest setting, it lasts for 24 hours. In this case, you will need to refill the propane tank twice a year.\nOn low settings, that’s enough capacity to last you well over a year.\nOne 20-lb propane refill will cost you around $15. That’s cheaper (per BTU of heat output) than running electric space heaters. Producing the same amount of heat electrically would cost you between $17-$34.\nSo, the Mr. Heater Big Buddy even saves you money in the long run!\n#2 Dr. Infrared Heater (electric, 85°F) The Dr. Infrared Heater is by far the best and most reliable infrared heater. It is strong enough to heat a small hot yoga room quickly to a maximum temperature of 85°F.\nHowever, that’s just the air temperature. Infrared heaters mainly radiate heat (just like a campfire) instead of heating the air. Raising the air temperature in your room is just one part. Infrared heaters heat the person, not the room. The heat coming out of an infrared heater feels a lot hotter than 85°F.\nTherefore, the perceived temperature of the Dr. Infrared Heater is around 100°F, while the actual air temperature is limited to 85°F.\nUnfortunately, the thermostat will cut off the heating after reaching 85°F and hold the temperature at 85°F.\nThe Dr. Infrared Heater runs purely electrically. So, contrasting the propane heater, you won’t need to organize yearly refills. You can just run it off the wall outlet.\n#3 Pelonis Oil-filled radiator (electric, 85°F) The Pelonis Oil-filled radiator is an electrically powered space heater. It heats to a maximum temperature of 85°F.\nI included this oil-filled radiator in this list for everyone who has kids or pets running around.\nThis oil-filled radiator produces the same amount of heat as the previous infrared heater. However, since the heat is not radiated as much, it feels less powerful.\nThe Pelonis oil-filled radiator distributes the heat by heating the air surrounding the large metal body. Contrasting the previous infrared heater, it does not have any (very) hot parts. Kids and pets can’t really burn themselves on this heater (unless they intentionally try to).\nSo, it’s the safest option of all three heaters. But it’s also the weakest in terms of perceived heat output.\nAll of the selected heaters can run continuously for the whole hot yoga session. They don’t overheat and provide an even heat output.\nFor everyone who is seriously into their hot yoga, I highly recommend getting the propane heater, since it provides so much more heat than the other heaters.\nCan Space Heaters run continuously during a Hot Yoga session? All quality space heaters are able to run continuously for the duration of a hot yoga session. However, cheaply made, low-quality space heaters are not safe to run for longer than 60 minutes at a time, since they overheat quickly.\nSpace heaters for hot yoga must be able to run for at least 3 hours continuously. The reason is that we have to account for the duration of a hot yoga session plus the heat-up time of the room plus a buffer period for safety reasons.\nIn general, I don’t recommend using any space heaters where the heat is distributed through plastic vents or heaters that give off a strong artificial smell after the unboxing. That’s usually a sign of low build quality.\nAll of the recommended space heaters for hot yoga in the previous section are safe for continuous usage over many hours.\nWill Space Heaters auto shut-off during your a hot yoga session? Most electric space heaters auto shut-off over the course of a yoga session. The heater will turn on again after a few minutes to keep the heat at the desired level. You can tell by a clicking noise coming from a relay in the thermostat.\nPropane heaters usually don’t automatically shut-off and provide a constant heat output.\nMost heaters have an overheat protection that can get triggered when the temperature rises too high. However, during regular hot yoga heating, this should not be the case.\nWhen your heater automatically shuts off due to its overheat protection, then that’s a sign of a fault in the heater. In this case, I recommend getting a new one.\nWhat space heater type is the best for Hot Yoga? (Comparison) Propane heaters are objectively the best space heaters for hot yoga. They provide enough heat to heat your room to well over 100°F, have a low running cost, and heat up a room quickly.\nHowever, if you have no access to propane refills, you can also get an infrared heater.\nMetricPropane HeaterInfrared Heater****Oil-filled RadiatorHeat output100°F85°F85°FCost per year$15$15$15Power18,000 BTU/h5119 BTU/h5119 BTU/hPerceived HeatHighHighModerateHeat DistributionHeats whole roomHeats mostly the person in front of itHeats whole roomHeat-up time5 minutes2-3 minutes15-30 minutes\nCost of running propane heaters and electric space heaters According to the heater cost-effectiveness article, a 20-lb propane gas refill is $15.17 at an average propane price of $3.90 per gallon.\nOne gallon of propane contains 430,000 BTUs of heat energy. In Kilowatt-hours that’s 126kWh.\nAt an electricity rate of $0.14 to $0.30 per kWh in the US, that’s an average cost of $17.64 to $37.80 for the same amount of heat produced.\nThat’s why with propane heaters you even save money heating. However, it’s a bit annoying that you can’t just plug them into the wall outlet and just run them like an electric space heater.\nHow to produce enough heat for hot yoga with electric space heaters If you want the comfort of running electric space heaters and the heating power of a propane heater, then I’d suggest running two electric space heaters simultaneously.\nJust make sure your fuse doesn’t trip. If it does, your home’s electric circuit can’t handle the load.\nAlso, I’d suggest not running any other appliances aside from your space heaters in the same room you’re doing your hot yoga session.\nEspecially when you opt for infrared heaters, running two at a time is beneficial, since infrared heat always feels warmer on the side of your body facing the heater than on the opposite side.\nRadiant heat feels the same as sitting in front of a campfire, where your face is glowing red and your back is still cold.\nRunning two infrared heaters in opposite corners of the room, both heaters facing towards the middle of the room compensates for this phenomenon and evenly distributes the heat across your body.\nPrinciples for maximizing the temperature in your room For hot yoga at home, two principles will help you squeeze the maximum temperature out of your heater:\nUse small rooms for hot yoga: The smaller your yoga space is, the less heat is needed to raise the temperature. Space size is equally important as the power of your heater. You can double the perceived heat output of your heater by choosing a yoga room half the size. Insulate your hot yoga room: Roll up a rug, towel, or a blanket and put it in front of the air gap below your door. This reduces the heat that leaves the room and, therefore, increases the amount of heat inside your room. Conclusion Propane heaters are the best heaters for hot yoga. However, they require propane refills twice a year. Electric space heaters don’t require refills and output less heat.\nSo, you can run two space heaters simultaneously.\nIf you are still not sure about the right heater, don\u0026rsquo;t get a space heater just based off the maximum temperature in the specs. Usually, that\u0026rsquo;s the temperature of the heating coil:\n\u0026ldquo;The high of 120F refers to the heat of the heating coil itself, not the ambient air temperature at which the unit shuts off, which is 85F.\u0026rdquo;\nmember of Hot Yoga Doctor forum\nBoth options have their advantages and disadvantages.

But does it also add value to your home?\nYes, radiant floor heating can add value to your home. But it is expensive — before adding floor heating, ensure your house is well-insulated, as insulation gives you a much better return on investment.\nRadiant floor heating adds value to your home in the following ways:\nIt keeps your house warm and makes it easier for you to relax It significantly increases the resell value of your house It ensures a safe and clean environment for your house It provides a sense of satisfaction and pride, resulting in some emotional value Radiant floor heating is becoming increasingly popular in new homes and can be a selling point for potential buyers.\nIn this article, I will mainly discuss the value that radiant floor heating adds to your house so that you can seriously consider this as an important commodity for your house\nWhat Exactly is Radiant Floor Heating? Radiant floor heating is a type of floor heating that supplies heat directly to the floor instead of warming the air inside the room. The radiated heat is then transferred to other objects in the room.\nRadiant floor heating is one of the most efficient ways to heat a space because the heat is produced directly beneath the floor surface, where it can be evenly distributed throughout the room.\nIt comprises heating elements and water tubes in your house beneath the floor. The entire system basically works on an infrared radiation mechanism that heats up an object, and you can feel the heat that the object emits even through a certain distance.\nThis heat is what you feel when you walk on the floors of your house, and it makes your house relaxing and comfortable.\nRadiant floor heating can be achieved through mainly two mechanisms. One uses electricity to heat the flooring, and the other uses hydronic sources as a source of energy.\nRadiant floor heating has numerous advantages. The most prominent advantages are being energy efficient to eliminate duct losses, preventing the spread of allergic substances, maintaining a constant temperature throughout the house, and requiring almost little to no maintenance.\nHow Does Radiant Flooring Add Value to Your Home? Radiant flooring adds comfort and emotional value to not only your house but also your monetary value. There are numerous benefits of radiant flooring, and I will discuss each in detail.\nConsidering all the values that it brings forth, you can make the right decision about adding radiant flooring to your house.\n#1 Heated Floors Make Your House Comfortable and Cozy If you live in a chilly area where it gets really cold in winter, you wouldn’t want to wake up and step on a cold floor in such weather, would you? This is exactly what heated floors can do for you. They can make your life easier in harsh weather and keep your house warm and cozy throughout harsh seasons.\nBesides knocking the chill off the floors, radiant floor heating would also elevate the temperature of your room and bring it to a more comfortable level.\nYou can use heated floors in your bathrooms or basement, which generally get very cold, and enjoy the experience of walking on warm and cozy floors.\nRadiant floor heating would give your house an added sense of comfort and luxury and allow your house to have a more relaxing and calm environment. It could be the next step in upgrading your house and making it more pleasant for you.\n#2 Radiant Floor Heating Increases Resale Value If you are someone who plans to sell their house five to ten years down the lane, then radiant floor heating is an ideal option for you. Radiant heating systems increase the resale value of the house.\nIf there are any potential homebuyers and they see that your house contains radiant floor heating, they would automatically understand that you have a luxury house and you are asking the right money for it.\nYou can also land a higher offer based solely on your house\u0026rsquo;s radiant floor heating.\nIf you plan to sell the house in a few months or a year, installing radiant floor heating won’t be a good idea because it requires some investment. Therefore, you should first fully use it for its worth and then plan on leaving it for someone else.\nRadiant floor heating in any house represents luxury, and many people are attracted by it. Thus, it makes for a great marketing and selling point and lands the right offer.\n#3 Heated Floors Increase Energy Efficiency One of the most amazing features of radiant floor heating is its energy efficiency. These systems are virtually 100% efficient because of the way they operate.\nUsually, the heating systems force-blow the air through vents. However, radiant floor heating systems work a little differently. These systems do not have a vent; thus, the heat produced just travels upwards and spreads out evenly, potentially having no room to escape.\nYou can use your thermostat to regulate the radiant heating systems and ensure they are only used when needed. You can schedule the times to turn on or off the radiating systems on your thermostat.\nBesides increasing energy efficiency, another advantage of radiant heating systems is that they can be used to balance out some areas that don’t balance out with the rest of the house and usually remain cold.\nThese systems can assist your HVAC systems and eliminate the need for them to overwork to keep your house warm.\n» Also read: 20 Cheapest Ways to Cool a Room \u0026amp; House\n#4 Radiant Floor Heating Reduces Noise Pollution If you have installed forced-air heating systems in your home, then you would be no stranger to the whirring, banging, and kicking noise that the furnaces of these systems produce.\nYou can say goodbye to all those noises and enjoy sweet silence if you switch to the radiant floor heating.\nLower noise pollution can help you focus on your work and get things done more efficiently. Thus, from now on, you can focus on your work better and move around more easily in your house.\nNo noise pollution due to radiant floor heating systems can significantly increase your sleep quality, even in cold weather when you have to switch on the heating systems.\nRadiant heating systems make little to no noise and help your house become more relaxing and comfortable, leading you to focus better and be more productive.\n#5 Floor Heating Systems Are Hypoallergenic The radiant floor heating systems are hypoallergenic because they do not involve spreading dust and other allergens. To understand how the floor heating systems are hypoallergenic, you would need to understand how they work.\nUnlike forced-air heat systems, which recirculate heated air and transmit dust and other particles, radiant floor heating works through a different mechanism.\nInstead of recirculating heated air, the radiant floor heating systems heat up the air through an electrical or a hydronic energy source.\nSince radiant floor heating does not recirculate the air, they limit the spread of allergens in your house and can maintain a constant temperature despite that.\n#6 Radiant Heating Systems Are Low-maintenance Radiant heating systems require little to no maintenance. These systems are highly efficient and, thus, do not need to be constantly maintained or serviced.\nThat is mainly because it is present underneath the floor and is a highly compact and protected system that can not get damaged by external influences such as rodents or other animals.\nMoreover, radiant heating systems do not age easily and are made to function long-term. Most of them come with a 25-year guarantee; if anything unlikely occurs, you can get it repaired then.\nThis means that radiant heating systems are just a one-time investment, and you would not be required to make hefty arrangements for their maintenance because they easily function for many years.\n#7 Constant Temperature and Even Heating Distribution One of the many interesting features of radiant heating systems is their ability to keep the room temperature constant throughout the day and night.\nThis is mainly because it stores energy during the day and uses it at night to maintain the temperature and keep your floor from getting cold.\nAn added advantage of this feature is that even if the power goes out for some reason, your radiant floor heating will be able to provide warmth for quite some time due to the energy it has stored in it.\nThe radiant heating systems are one-of-a-kind in providing your house with even heating distribution.\nThe reason for even heat distribution is that it allows the heat to come from every square foot of the flooring, and since the heat has a tendency to rise, the underground location of these systems is ideal for providing your house with relaxing warmth.\n#8 Increased Safety and Comfortable Heat When you use a stove or a heater to heat up your house, there is always the risk of uneven distribution of heat and someone burning themselves while adjusting these devices.\nWith the radiant floor heating system, you can prevent that. These systems are highly safe because the heating source is underneath the ground and cannot harm you.\nBesides safety, the radiant floor heating provides comfortable heat that feels soft on your feet as you walk on the flooring. These heating systems are often called a ‘heated blanket’ and are particularly useful for people in the winter.\n#9 Long-term Investment and Peace Of Mind Though radiant floor heating requires some hefty investment, once you install it, you will understand that it is totally worth it.\nRadiant floor heating systems do not require any maintenance and provide numerous comfort, monetary, and health benefits that are hard to find in any other heating system.\nMoreover, once you install the radiant floor heating systems, you will have peace of mind and not have to think about them again. You can enjoy the benefits of these systems for a long time, and once you go to radiant floor heating, you will not be able to find your way back!\nCons Of Radiant Floor Heating Here are some cons of radiant floor heating:\n#1 Radiant Floor Heating Is Expensive Radiant floor heating is expensive. Sometimes the contractors may even charge you more. Though this is a one-time investment, it is pretty hefty, and you should consider your decision.\nOne way to save money could be to hire a contractor you know personally, but you should not compromise on quality and ensure that they know the work properly.\n#2 Difficult to Find Contractors to Install It Since radiant floor heating systems are extensive and complicated, you rarely find the person rightly qualified for the job.\nSince the trend of radiant floor heating has just started to catch up, most contractors do not know how to install it. Thus, before hiring a contractor, you should thoroughly check that they will install it properly and will not mess it up for you.\n#3 Time Lag Of Heat Movement One con of a radiant floor heating system is that it takes time to spread evenly and would not instantly heat up the floors.\nMany areas of your house are already receiving heat from solar energy, and if the heat produced by these systems reaches those floor areas, it may lead to an overheating problem.\nTo avoid this problem, you shouldn’t install radiant heat floor slabs where you think that the air directly gets heated by sunlight.\nTypes Of Radiant Floor Heating If you have decided to install radiant floor heating systems, you must look for the type of radiant floor heating you want.\nThere are three types of radiant floor heating, and they have different qualities.\n#1 Electric Electric heating systems use electric coils to generate heat. They use electrical cables or electrically conductive mats installed beneath the flooring.\nThough installing these systems is cost-effective and cheaper than hydronic systems, the fuel (electricity) you are using to operate these systems would be more expensive long-term.\nThis option is usually used for single rooms like bathrooms to provide luxury and comfort. However, they can also be used for small houses.\n#2 Hydronic Hydronic heating systems are probably the most frequently used and cost-effective systems out there. These systems operate by pumping water heated from a boiler and converting it into gas.\nThis system has the tubing laid out in a pattern that allows maximal heat distribution under the floor. Moreover, if your home already uses a water heater, these systems are ideal for you.\n#3 Air-Heated Air-heated systems are also another type of radiant floor heating system, but they are rarely used because they are not great at functioning simply because air cannot hold and transfer large amounts of heat.\nBesides low functionality, these systems are not even cost-effective and are not a viable option for your residential property.\nIs Radiant Floor Heat Worth the Money? The radiant floor heating systems are worth your money. Though these systems are expensive to install, they provide substantial value for your house in the long run.\nYou should also remember that the underground floor heating systems allow you to save more in the long run by keeping your house energy efficient and saving up on bills.\nIf you do not have a very high budget, you can always make adjustments and look at different options that you may find more appropriate.\nWhich Types of Floor Heating Bring the Most Value? Electric radiant floor heating systems bring the most value to your home. They\u0026rsquo;re less expensive and can cut more maintenance costs than hydronic systems.\nAdditionally, electric floor heating systems are more energy efficient than gas-fired alternatives.\nHydroponic radiant systems use heating pipes that run through the concrete, absorbing the heat from the heated water.\nYou also risk water leakage and potential damage to your home if you choose this heating system. Any accident can lead to significantly less home value.\nElectric radiant floor heating is risk-free and efficient, making it the best value for your money.\nWhen trying to determine which type of floor heating is the best investment for your property, there are a few factors that you should take into account.\nSome of the things to consider include the following:\nThe cost of installation and maintenance How efficient will the system be in terms of heat distribution How long will it last The style of flooring that will be installed How Much Does a Radiant Floor Heating Installation Cost? A radiant floor heating installation costs between $1,700 and $6,000, with an average of $3,800 per installation project. However, this cost depends on the size and type of installation.\nFactors that will affect the price include:\nArea of the floor Labor Your location (urban or suburban) Type of flooring being installed (ceramic, vinyl, wood) Installing a new system or upgrading an existing one, The complexity of the installation. Labor costs Floor Area Typically, you should expect to pay $6 to $20 per square feet for a radiant floor heating system installation. Hence, if you own a 1,600 square feet house and are looking to install a radiant floor heating system, you could expect to pay around $9,600 to $32,000.\nMaintenance Costs Radiant floor heating systems will need zero maintenance over the years. However, if your heating system is damaged for some reason, you can expect to pay around $1,300.\nLabor Costs for Radiant Floor Heating Installation The average labor cost for radiant floor heating installation is between $550 and $2,500, depending on the floor area. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re going for a DIY floor heating project, it can save a few extra thousand dollars.\nWhich Government Incentives Are There For Installing Radiant Floor Heating? The government of the U.S. does not incentivize floor heating as it\u0026rsquo;s not inherently environmentally friendly. However, the source of floor heating (such as solar or electrical systems) can bring some incentives depending on your state.\nFor example, you can qualify for a financial incentive if you lie in the category of the California Solar Initiative (CSI) Thermal Low-Income program.\nOr you can get some tax credits for installing geothermal heating systems.\nYou can explore more incentives on the DSIRE USA site.\nFinal Words Radiant floor heating is a valuable addition to any house. It not only provides comfort and luxury but also increases the house\u0026rsquo;s energy efficiency and keeps a healthy environment.\nThese systems are well-operated and require low maintenance, making them the ideal heating options for your house.\nEven though these systems require a good investment, you will be able to make their worth by using them for subsequent years to add comfort and warmth to your house.\nIf you want your house to be comfortable and cozy and want to save up on high energy bills, radiant floor heating is indeed the right way to go!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/does-radiant-floor-heating-add-value-to-home/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRadiant floor heating is a popular choice for people who want to improve their home\u0026rsquo;s comfort and energy efficiency.

Here’s how many solar panels you need to cover a heat pump’s power consumption. Additionally, you’ll get to know the cost of installing the solar panels as well as the heat pump.\nQuick answer: Yes, you need 17 solar panels to run an average 3-ton heat pump. Depending on the unit size and efficiency of your heat pump, you will need anywhere between 5 to 32 solar panels. Check the table below to see how many solar panels you need to run your heat pump.\nStick out! In this article, we’re going to cover\nHow we got to these results Tables with the exact number of solar panels you need to install to run your heat pump How much installing the solar panels and the heat pump will cost you So, let’s start!\nHow much Power does a Heat Pump consume? Heat pumps use anywhere between 545W and 4,286W of power depending on the unit size and SEER rating.\nSEER is the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating. It describes how many BTUs (British Thermal Units) you get per Watt of input power.\nDon’t worry, we’re not going into any calculations. Check the article on how to calculate heat pump power usage if you are interested in how to get to these results.\nYou can look up the SEER value of your heat pump in the specifications (a sticker somewhere on your heat pump, or just google it).\nIf you are too lazy to look up, then just assume your heat pump has a SEER of 16 or 18. That’s a reasonable assumption for most modern heat pumps.\nIn this article, I am going to hide the difficult stuff from you and just present you the numbers.\nTo find out how many solar panels you need to power a heat pump, we have to first find out how much electric energy a heat pump uses per year.\nHow much energy does a heat pump consume in a year? A heat pump runs an average of 5475 hours a year. Small and efficient units use 2,984kWh and large, inefficient units use up to 14,076kWh a year.\nThe energy consumption of your heat pump (moderately sized and medium efficiency) is likely somewhere in the middle, between 6,500kWh and 8,000kWh.\nDepending on your heat pump unit’s size and efficiency, this causes the following energy requirements:\nUnit size14 SEER16 SEER18 SEER20 SEER22 SEER1.0 tons4,692kWh4,106kWh3,652kWh3,285kWh2,984kWh1.5 tons7,041kWh6,159kWh5,475kWh4,928kWh4,479kWh2.0 tons9,384kWh8,213kWh7,298kWh6,570kWh5,973kWh2.5 tons11,733kWh10,266kWh9,127kWh8,213kWh7,468kWh3.0 tons14,076kWh12,319kWh10,950kWh9,855kWh8,957kWh3.5 tons16,425kWh14,372kWh12,773kWh11,498kWh10,452kWh4.0 tons18,774kWh16,425kWh14,602kWh13,140kWh11,946kWh4.5 tons21,117kWh18,478kWh16,425kWh14,783kWh13,441kWh5.0 tons23,466kWh20,531kWh18,248kWh16,425kWh14,930kWh\nHow much Power do Solar Panels produce? Now we know how much energy a heat pump requires in a year. The only thing left to do is to find out how much energy an average solar panel produces in a given year.\nI’ve already crunched the numbers in this article: Can solar panels heat a house?\nHere’s the result:\nAn average solar panel generates 1.8kWh (Kilo-Watt hours) of energy per day. In 1 year, that’s 657kWh of electricity.\nHow many Solar Panels do you need to run a Heat Pump? Now that we know how much power a heat pump uses, and how much power an average solar panel generates, we can calculate the number of solar panels you are going to need to power your heat pump.\nThe table below lists the required number of solar panels for different unit sizes and SEER ratings:\nUnit size14 SEER16 SEER18 SEER20 SEER22 SEER1.0 tons7 panels6 panels6 panels5 panels5 panels1.5 tons11 panels9 panels8 panels8 panels7 panels2.0 tons14 panels13 panels11 panels10 panels9 panels2.5 tons18 panels16 panels14 panels13 panels11 panels3.0 tons21 panels19 panels17 panels15 panels14 panels3.5 tons25 panels22 panels19 panels18 panels16 panels4.0 tons29 panels25 panels22 panels20 panels18 panels4.5 tons32 panels28 panels25 panels23 panels20 panels5.0 tons36 panels31 panels28 panels25 panels23 panels\nHow much is the installation cost of solar panels for a heat pump? “The average total cost to install a residential system for solar panels before tax credits or rebates is comparable to the price tag on a new car.”\nconsumeraffairs.com\nMan, that\u0026rsquo;s a vague statement. Is it as expensive as a 10-year old used Toyota, or is it a new Benz? I hate meaningless statements. So, again, I crunched the numbers for you.\nThe installation cost of solar panels is between $2.20 and $2.80 per Watt.\nOne heat pump uses between 545W (22 SEER) and 857W (14 SEER) per ton.\nTo cover the cost of heat pumps, you will need to install between $1362.50 and $2142.5 worth of solar panels per ton of heating capacity.\nThis assumption leads to the following results:\nHeat pump sizeMinimum solar panel system costMaximum solar panel system cost****1 ton$1,362.50$2,142.502 tons$2,725.00$4,285.003 tons$4,087.50$6,427.504 tons$5,450.00$8,570.005 tons$6,812.50$10,712.50\nAdditionally, you can add 30-50% on top for the installation. The exact installation cost is hard to tell. You should get your phone and call 2-3 companies to get a quote! (Always tell them you’ve already called their competitors, and they are cheaper!)\nAnyways, installing solar panels is an expensive investment. Nevertheless, solar panels pay for themselves after 7 years. That’s a good return on investment here. After 7 years, you are profiting. I think it’s worth it.\nAre Solar Panels compatible with a Heat Pump? Yes, solar panels are compatible with a heat pump. Solar panels connect directly to your neighborhood\u0026rsquo;s electric grid and make use of net metering. Net metering is when you feed power into the electric grid and you are compensated for it on your electric bill.\nThis means the power you generate in the summertime when there’s lots of sunshine pays for your heating in the winter!\nIf you are using solar panels off-grid, you should get a large battery to store as much energy as possible.\nHowever, in this situation, I think solar panels and heat pumps are not the right way to heat. Rather you should stick to wood-burning stoves. Heating using a stove is objectively the most cost-effective way to heat a room (backed up by data).\nSolar Panels and Heat Pumps: Conclusion Combining a heat pump with solar panels is a great way to heat a house!\nEspecially since the heat pump acts as leverage (it has an efficiency bigger than one), meaning it moves more heat into your home than it consumes. This reduces the number of solar panels you are going to need to heat your home as compared to other heating methods that rely on electricity.\nYou had a great idea and you’ve got my approval!\n(Which is worth something, considering I am very critical when it comes to fancy heating methods)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-solar-panels-power-heat-pump/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSolar panels can power a heat pump.

But gas- and fuel-burning heaters can emit carbon monoxide!\nQuick answer: Electric space heaters never emit carbon monoxide. However, fuel or gas-burning heaters can produce carbon monoxide if broken or improperly adjusted. You can avoid indoor carbon monoxide buildup by using the right space heaters and regularly venting your room.\nIn this article, we\u0026rsquo;re shedding light on what type of space heaters can emit carbon monoxide, and how you can carbon monoxide-proof your home. Also, you’re going to learn about the most important gas-protection measures when running a fuel-burning space heater indoors.\nWhich Space Heaters never emit carbon monoxide? There are two types of space heaters that never emit carbon monoxide.\nOil-filled radiators. I recommend this Pelonis oil-filled radiator (click to see my review). It is a very safe space heater. It’s very suitable for heating if kids or pets are around. Infrared heaters. Personally, I am using both oil-filled and infrared heaters. Infrared heaters are very nice due to their high perceived efficiency. They radiate heat in just one direction. So, you can point them towards you and they will heat just the area around you. Infrared heaters can get quite hot, so I don’t recommend them with (small) kids or pets. This Dr. Infrared heater (click to see it) is my favorite infrared heater. Infrared and oil-filled radiators don’t emit carbon monoxide because they are electrically powered and don’t burn any kind of fuel or gas.\nOil-filled radiators don’t burn the oil inside them! The oil is merely used as heat storage (similar to the water in a hot water bottle).\nWhich Space Heaters can Emit Carbon Monoxide? All space heaters that burn fuel (such as propane, kerosene, or lamp oil) can potentially produce carbon monoxide if they are broken or improperly adjusted.\nThe gas is produced during the combustion process when the fuel is on fire, specifically when combustion is incomplete. This can occur with gas heaters using propane or natural gas, kerosene heaters, wood stoves, or fireplaces (wood-burning or gas-fired).\nCarbon monoxide production only occurs if the space heater is broken or improperly adjusted.\nProperly installed and functioning space heaters will produce an ideal and wasteless burn, and therefore present no danger of carbon monoxide emission.\nHow does a gas space heater ideal burn work? To get an ideal burn when using a propane or gas space heater, two conditions must be met;\nA proper burn needs fuel, air, and an ignition source. The ratio of gas to air must be within a certain range for combustion to occur, which is anywhere between 2.2 and 9.6 propane to 97.9 to 90.4 oxygen. However, the ideal burn is only achieved when the ratio is 4 parts gas and 96 parts oxygen. If the ratio varies from 4:96, there is incomplete combustion, and the risk of carbon monoxide production rises.\nThis ratio adjustment is one of the reasons why you need a professional HVAC company to fix broken gas heaters. A good company ensures that the ratio of air to gas is properly adjusted before returning the repaired space heater to you.\nBecause we’re using space heaters indoors, a gas heater runs on your living space’s oxygen. The oxygen rate in your room, therefore, also determines whether a space heater emits toxic gases, or not.\n(Another reason to vent your room regularly, aside from the stink!)\nWhy Electric Space Heaters don’t Emit Carbon Monoxide Carbon monoxide is created when you burn a fuel under a limited oxygen supply. Electric space heaters do not use any fuel, so they cannot produce carbon monoxide or any other gas.\nIn essence, an electric heater works when electricity flows through a metal or ceramic heating element or coil to produce heat. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple physics mechanism that doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve burning anything or producing any by-products.\nBut how about oil-filled radiators? Well, unlike home furnaces that burn heating oil as fuel, oil-filled radiators use oil only as a heat conductor. The fins in the radiator are filled with diathermic oil that absorbs heat without boiling or evaporating. This hot oil circulates through the radiator and evenly distributes the heat so it can radiate into the room evenly.\nThe heaters still use electricity as the heat source, but the oil makes the transfer of heat more efficient, therefore using less power.\nAt no time is this oil ever burned or subjected to heat so this is the safest space heater where carbon monoxide emission is a concern. Furthermore, oil-filled space heaters are closed systems, so they don\u0026rsquo;t emit any gases at all, even carbon dioxide.\nDo Electric Space Heaters Emit any Gases? Electric space heaters do not burn any fuel, even oil-filled ones, so no by-products are produced. Instead, electric current simply flows through some coils and emits heat into the room.\nHowever, if you have a space heater made of cheap materials, you may notice some type of smell when the appliance is new. This should wear off after a few days if the heater is working properly.\nHow to prevent indoor carbon monoxide buildup Since carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, it can take a long while before you realize its presence. If you are using a combustion space heater or any other fuel-burning appliance, here are a few ways you can reduce carbon monoxide exposure and take steps before it’s too late.\nRegularly vent your room Install effective ventilation systems to remove carbon monoxide and leave the windows and doors open regularly during the day.\nUse fuel-burning space heaters only outdoors I would not recommend combustion heaters for indoor use if you have a windowless or ventless room.\nDespite being more affordable and cheaper to run, combustion space heaters are a bit risky in window-less rooms, so opt for electric space heaters instead.\nHow to check a space heater for toxic gases (carbon monoxide) and incomplete burn Let’s see how we can check for toxic gases and especially carbon monoxide\nCheck the flame color of your heater You can tell your gas space heater has an ideal burn when the flame is blue, which means the fuel is burning to completion.\nIf your space heater does not burn the gas or fuel properly, the color of the flame changes from blue to yellow or reddish.\nCheck for soot collection There will also be soot collection on the heater and excess water vapor forming on your house windows.\nAgain, look at the appliance itself to see if the flame is yellow or orange if there is brown or black soot staining around the heat source.\nThe pilot light on the heater can also start going on and off frequently.\nInstall carbon monoxide detectors The alarms will go off if the carbon monoxide concentration in your house rises and allow you to leave the house in time.\nAlso, have the detectors maintained annually to ensure they are working well. At least change the batteries.\nReduced heating efficiency If your gas or fuel-based space heater produces less heat while still consuming the same amount of fuel, there’s a high chance of incomplete combustion.\nSevere signs of carbon monoxide presence Other tell-tale signs of carbon monoxide presence in a home include dying plants, constant headaches among family members, dizziness, nausea, and feeling breathless or suffocated.\nIf you notice any of these signs, stop using the space heater immediately and get out of the house to get some oxygen. The house should be adequately aired before you go back in to ensure exposure is low enough.\nAnd of course: Stop using that space heater!\nFinal Thoughts Except for electric space heaters, other types can emit carbon monoxide and other harmful gases.\nEven so, many of them are very safe if working properly and when the house is well-ventilated. Be sure to have a professional recommend and install the right space heater for you, as well as maintain it regularly.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/do-space-heaters-emit-carbon-monoxide/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eElectric space heaters don’t emit carbon monoxide.

But don’t worry! You won’t have to do a single calculation yourself.\nI have calculated all the wattages and yearly running costs for the most common heat pump sizes (1-5 tons) and the most common energy efficiencies (SEER ratings between 14 and 22) for you.\nSo, you can just look up the numbers for your heat pump!\nQuick answer: An average heat pump runs on 667W of power per ton, with a seasonal energy efficiency rating (SEER) of 18. A 3-ton unit, therefore, needs 2,000W of power and costs you $1,533 a year.\nFurther below, you will find the wattages of different heat pump sizes and SEER ratings, as well as their yearly running cost!\nHow to calculate heat pump power consumption? Knowing the power consumption of your heat pump is important to answer several questions:\nWhich generator will run a heat pump? Can you run a heat pump off solar panels? How much does a heat pump cost per year? How to size a heat pump? Let’s have a look at the formula to calculate the power consumption of a heat pump. Don’t worry, we won’t dive too deep into the maths! A surface look is enough.\nFormula:\nUnit size (in BTU/h) = Unit size (in tons) × 12,000 BTU/h\nTotal Wattage (in Watts) = Unit size (in BTU/h) ÷ SEER (in BTU/Wh)\nExplanation of the heat pump total wattage formula The first formula calculates the size of a heat pump unit in BTU/h. The most common metrics to note heat pump sizes are tons and BTU/h.\nOne ton is equal to 12,000BTU/h. For calculating the total wattage of a heat pump, we need the unit size denoted in BTU/h.\nThat’s why I included the first formula, which is nothing more than a simple unit conversion.\nThe second formula calculates the total wattage of a heat pump. The total wattage, as per the formula, depends only on the heat pump unit size and the SEER.\nThe SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating) is a metric that determines the energy efficiency of a heat pump.\nYou can find the SEER on every heat pump’s specification sheet.\nThe SEER is defined as\nSEER (in BTU/Wh) = Total Wattage (in Watts) ÷ Unit size (in BTU/h)\nSo, the formula to find the total wattage comes from the definition of SEER. By simply transforming the SEER definition formula, we get the total wattage formula.\nI hope my explanations cleared up the formulas! If it did not click, don’t worry. The next thing that follows is an example calculation and a table with all the wattages and costs pre-calculated for you.\nYou don’t need to use a single brain cell.\nHeat pump power consumption example calculation What size (in BTU/h) is a 3-ton heat pump?\n3 tons × 12,000 BTU/h = 36,000 BTU/h\nThat’s it!\nHow much power does my 3-ton heat pump consume?

Also, the wattage decreases for increasing efficiencies.\nPer ton, an average 18 SEER heat pump consumes 667W of power. An average 3-ton heat pump uses 2,000W.\nHow to calculate your yearly heat pump cost? Here’s the formula to calculate your yearly heat pump cost.\nCost (in $/year) = Unit size (in BTU/h) × Hours per year (in h) × Electricity rate (in $/kWh) ÷ SEER (in BTU/Wh) ÷ 1000 (in W/kW)\nThe yearly running cost of your heat pump depends on the unit size, the running hours per year, your personal electricity rate, and the SEER.\nYou can find your heat pump’s unit size and SEER rating in the specification. Your personal electricity rate is listed on your most recent electricity bill.\nHowever, figuring out the hours your heat pump runs per year is not as straightforward as a simple lookup. I’ve crunched the numbers for you!\nHow long does a heat pump run per year? A heat pump runs 2-3 cycles an hour. One such cycle usually lasts between 10 and 20 minutes. For average values, we can estimate 2.5 cycles per hour and 15 minutes per cycle.\nThis means your heat pump will run for\n2.5 cycles × 15 minutes = 37.5 minutes per hour = 0.625h\n0.625 × 24h a day is 15 hours a day\n15h × 365 days a year = 5475 hours a year\nA heat pump runs 5475 hours a year on average.\nHeat pump yearly cost example calculation Let’s look at the same 3-ton (36,000BTU/h) heat pump with a SEER of 14 which we already used in our earlier example calculation.\nI assume an average electricity rate of $0.14 per kWh.\nUsing the formula from the previous section:\nYearly cost = 36,000BTU/h × 5475h × $0.14 ÷ 14 SEER ÷ 1000 = $1,971\nTo spare yourself the calculation, just look up your personal heat pump’s running cost in the next section!\nHow much does running a heat pump cost per year?

A heat pump costs between $418 and $3,285 to run per year, depending on the unit size and the energy efficiency.\nFor the values in the table, I assumed an average yearly running duration of 5475h. And I assumed an electricity rate of $0.14 per kWh, which is the US average.\nIf your yearly heat pump hours or your electricity rate vary significantly from these assumed averages, then you can use the formula to calculate your personal heat pump running cost.\nAlso, you can just increase the values by a fixed percentage. For example, if your electricity rate is 50% higher than the assumed value of $0.14 per kWh, you can just your heat pump running cost by 50% accordingly.\nConclusion Calculating heat pump power consumption and running costs can be overwhelming. Especially, if you are new to heat pumps.\nHowever, the heat pump power consumption and running cost tables for different heat pump unit sizes and SEER ratings should help you look up the values you are looking for.\nPlease note that heat pump wattages and running costs vary significantly by location.\nThe reason is that different states have different electricity rates and different climates.\nDepending on the climate you are living in and your personal electricity rate, your cost may vary up or down.\nUnfortunately, there’s not much you can do about it, except looking for a cheaper electricity provider (in case you are paying too much).\nTitle image by gsbrown\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-much-power-does-a-heat-pump-use/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHeat pumps use between 545W and 4,286W of power depending on unit size and energy efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, you’re going to learn how to calculate heat pump wattages and yearly running costs.

(1-5 Tons)"},{"content":"Only home standby generators can power heat pumps larger than 2 tons. However, even smaller heat pumps require expertise in wiring and setup.\nIn this article, we’re going to check the wattages, different heat pump sizes use, and which generators suit each heat pump size.\nQuick answer: Only a home standby generator can power a medium-sized heat pump. Small heat pumps of 1-2 tons can be powered off large portable generators. However, getting a portable generator just for powering a heat pump is cost-inefficient. Rather, consider getting a wood stove or a propane heater. These provide more BTUs of heat energy for less money.\nHow much power do heat pumps use? The power your heat pump uses depends on its size (in tons or BTUs) which directly correlates with the size of your home.\nAn average heat pump with a heating efficiency of 20 SEER consumes 600W per 1 ton.\nHowever, the power of heat pumps ranges from 545W - 850W per ton depending on the SEER rating.\nSEER stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating and determines the amount of BTUs a heat pump can move per Watt.\nA SEER rating of 20, for example, says that a heat pump is able to move 20 BTUs of heat per Watt.\nA high SEER rating is generally better than a lower one.\nThe upper power consumption limit of 857W per 1 ton (which equals 12,000 BTUs) stems from the minimum allowable SEER rating for heat pumps which is 14.\n12,000 BTUs / 14 SEER = 857.14W\nThis upper power consumption limit is valuable for finding out the generator size we need. All heat pumps are legally required to consume less than 857.14W of power per ton.\nYou can find out the exact heat pump size you need through a house audit performed by a professional. They will set up a door construction (or \u0026ldquo;blower door test\u0026rdquo;) that measures your house\u0026rsquo;s heating needs.\n“This blower door test, combined with some other data, like the climate of the city you live in, will help them produce a Manual J Load Calculation, which is the industry standard way to size an HVAC system.”\nOften these measurements are free of charge. Of course. The HVAC company wants to sell you a heat pump, so it lowers your entry barrier to buying from them.\nPower consumption of different heat pump sizes **House size (in square feet)****Heat pump size (in tons)****Maximum average power consumption (in Watts)**500 sq. ft.1 ton857W1,000 sq. ft.2 tons1,714W1,500 sq. ft.3 tons2,571W2,000 sq. ft.4 tons3,429W2,500 sq. ft.5 tons4,286W3,000 sq. ft.6 tons5,143W\nPlease note that the right column lists the maximum average power consumption. The maximum average power consumption is the maximum amount of power that a heat pump consumes on average. It is NOT the maximum power consumption.\nThe maximum average power consumption determines the power consumption for the worst legally allowable SEER rating of 14.\nAccording to the table, you need about 1 ton per 500 square feet of house area.\nHow much power do generators provide? Different size generators produce different amounts of power.\nHere’s a table with the most common generator types, the amount of power they produce, and their respective prices.\nGenerator typePowerCostSmall Recreational Generator\u0026lt; 2,000W$450 - $1600Midsized Inverter2,000W - 3,500W$800 - $2,400Large Portable Generator\u0026lt; 8,500W$950 - $2,000Large Inverter5,000W - 7,500W$1,400 - $1,800Home Standby\u0026lt; 20,000W$2,000 - $6,000\nWhich size generator can run a heat pump? Only a home standby generator can reliably run a heat pump. Smaller generators are theoretically able to power small 1-2 ton heat pumps. However, you can’t power additional appliances with them.\nThe amperage a heat pump needs to get started is 3x the amperage it needs once it\u0026rsquo;s running.\nRespectively, for starting, a heat pump needs 3x the power. A generator should, therefore, be able to support 3x the power a heat pump is classified for.\nLet’s have a look:\nHeat pump size (in tons)****Required startup power (in Watts)****Theoretical smallest generator required1 ton2571WMidsized Inverter (2kW - 3.5kW)2 tons5143WLarge Inverter (5kW - 7.5kW)3 tons7714WHome Standby (\u0026lt;20kW)4 tons10286WHome Standby (\u0026lt;20kW)5 tons12857WHome Standby (\u0026lt;20kW)6 tons15429W Home Standby (\u0026lt;20kW)\nAs you see, for most heat pump sizes a home standby generator is required.\nSmaller 1-2 ton heat pumps may theoretically run off a midsized inverter or large inverter-type generator.\nHowever, you should get a professional’s consultancy and confirmation on whether using anything else than a home standby generator in your case makes sense and is technically possible.\nAnother problem with using small generators is that you are not able to power any appliances aside from the heat pump.\nIn an energy outage, a heat pump is not a priority. Other devices, such as a fridge, are a lot more important because they keep you alive! A heat pump is only a luxury.\nIt is, therefore, pointless to size a generator exactly for one heat pump without accounting for additional buffer power.\nWill a portable generator run a heat pump? Regular portable generators are not able to power a heat pump. An extra strong portable generator might theoretically be able to power a heat pump. However, you should consult an expert to perform the wiring.\nCan a portable generator power a mini split heat pump?\nMini split heat pumps are a smaller and almost portable form of heat pumps. An average mini split heat pump uses around 2,000W.\nThey are designed for regular wall-outlet use. Therefore, we don’t have to account for any wiring and startup issues as with regularly sized heat pumps.\nYes, a portable generator rated \u0026gt; 3,000W can reliably run an average 2,000W mini split heat pump. Place the generator outdoors. Otherwise, it mitigates the heat pump’s efficiency.\nAlso, a generator exhausts toxic gases such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. You don’t want them in your living space.\nDoes powering a heat pump off a generator make sense? Powering a heat pump off a generator is only worth it for long-term usage. Buying a generator to power your heat pump, or buying a heat pump to run off your generator, just to cover emergency situations does not make sense.\nBoth a heat pump and a generator are very expensive appliances. Additionally, they require maintenance.\nBoth heat pumps and generators contain moving parts, which cause friction and wear down. Heat pumps and generators are very prone to wear and tear.\nFor emergencies, it is better to use low-maintenance and cost-effective heating methods for energy outages.\nTwo of the best heating methods that don’t require electricity and that don’t need any moving parts are\nwood-burning stoves and propane gas heaters If you are thinking about buying a heat pump or a generator (if you don’t have these yet), then please consider getting a wood stove first!\nWood stoves produce by far the most BTUs of heating energy per dollar spent. They are the objectively most cost-effective heating method.\nAdditionally, you can stack and store a lot of wood in your garden. It is much harder to store a lot of fuel for powering a generator. It might even be legally prohibited in your location.\nIf you now think that both wood-burning stoves and heat pumps are too expensive, then I highly recommend getting a propane gas heater, such as this Mr. Heater Big Buddy.\nIt produces as much heat energy as a wood stove and even more than a small heat pump!\nHowever, with about $150 (or \u0026lt;$100 for smaller models), it costs just a fraction of a heat pump or a wood stove.\nYou’ll only need to store some propane gas at home. A 20-lb tank costs about $15 and lasts you for weeks if you use it economically.\nHow to install a generator with a heat pump? To install a heat pump and connect it to a home standby generator, you have to hire a licensed electrician.\nSeveral issues make heat pump installation with generators hard:\nComplicated wiring. Some heat pumps run on two different input voltages (120V and 240V which needs to be accounted for) Asynchronous frequencies. Starting a generator that is not in sync with your neighborhood’s electric grid can be a safety issue and cause lethal shocks Lack of resources. There are no proper resources online on how to do it for a reason. Only licensed electricians are qualified to do it Interference with neighbors. It might be necessary to check and understand the neighbor’s power supply, especially if they also have a home standby generator Personally, I don’t recommend being the person responsible for accounting for and solving these issues. If something goes wrong, your insurance (if you even have one), won’t be happy. And probably they won’t take responsibility for your carelessness.\nConclusion You can run a heat pump off a home standby generator. However, you will need a licensed electrician’s help for proper installation.\nFor emergencies, a simple wood stove or a propane gas heater will work just as well, but with a lot less hassle and lower cost!\nTitle image by unlimidev\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/what-size-generator-can-run-a-heat-pump/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOnly home standby generators can power heat pumps larger than 2 tons.

However, running a space heater on high heating settings continuously gets expensive quickly.\nQuick answer: Yes, you can run a space heater off a solar panel. One solar panel produces enough energy to run one space heater on full power for 1.2h a day. To run a space heater continuously, you need 20 solar panels. Wood-burning stoves or propane gas heaters are more cost-effective for off-grid heating.\nIn this article, we’re checking exactly how many solar panels you need to power a space heater in different circumstances. Also, we’re going to cover heating methods that are a lot more cost-effective.\nSo, stick out to the end.\nHow much power does a solar panel produce? An average solar panel produces between 250W and 400W of power in the summertime. In the wintertime, however, power production decreases significantly due to the lack of sunshine.\nOn an average day, a solar panel produces 1.8kWh of energy. That’s the amount of energy needed to run a 1.8kW device for 1 hour.\nHow much power does a space heater need? An average space heater consumes 1,500W on maximum heat settings. However, in normal circumstances, the average power consumption of a space heater is closer to 1,000W.\nThe reason for the reduced power consumption is the built-in thermostat. A thermostat is a small device that measures the current temperature in a room and adjusts the power consumption of a heater accordingly.\nShortly after turning on, a space heater consumes a peak power of about 1,500W. When it senses a rise in room temperature, it decreases the power consumption or turns off the heating overall.\nThe exact wattage a space heater consumes in your home depends on the insulation of your room and the current room temperature. Insulation is important for keeping power consumption down since it keeps the heat and, therefore, a space heater’s thermostat turns on for reheating less often.\nHow many solar panels do you need to run a space heater? With one panel producing 1.8kWh a day, you can power one 1,500W space heater on full settings for 1.2 hours.\nSpace heaters will run on full power when it’s very cold outside and the insulation can’t hold the heat inside. It’s the worst-case, which we account for.\nThe table below lists how many hours of full-power heating you can get from a number of solar panels.\nSolar PanelsSpace heater hours11.222.45610122024\nIn most cases, however, you can increase the amount of space heater hours a solar panel generates by 50% if you assume an average power usage of 1,000W per space heater.\nThis means, depending you could also get up to 1.8h of space heater usage out of a single solar panel.\nThe table lists just the minimum amount of power you get out of your solar panels.\nTo power a space heater on full settings for 24 hours, you need 20 solar panels. On moderate settings, you need 10 solar panels to run a space heater.\nThat is, however, a conservative estimate. Usually, a space heater does not run on full power, and you don’t need it to run for 24 hours continuously.\nAssuming your space heater runs on just 1,000W on average, and you need it to run only 8 hours a day, you need “ only” 9 solar panels.\nHow to run a space heater off solar energy in winter According to an experiment by “The Solar Nerd” on an average winter day, one solar panel produces around 0.25kWh of energy.\nThat’s barely anything. It’s about the amount of energy to charge two power banks or boil a few pots of tea. But it’s not enough to keep a room heated.\nThat’s only a fraction of 15.56% of the solar power available in summertime. To independently heat a space heater off just 0.25kWh per solar panel, you’d need, therefore 20 solar panels * 1.8kWh / 0.25kWh = 144 solar panels.\nFor powering a space heater off solar panels off-grid in winter, you need 144 solar panels.\nThat neither makes sense nor is it cost-effective. Luckily, we have “net metering” to solve this issue.\nWhat is net metering? How does it work? Net-metering is a virtual storage of the solar energy you produce that can be accessed anytime.\nWhile in the summertime, solar panels could support running a space heater for a few hours, in wintertime, they can’t.\nIdeally, it should be the other way around. Who needs space heaters in summer?\nThe solution to this problem is net-metering. Net-metering is the concept to feed your solar panels\u0026rsquo; power into your neighborhood’s electric grid. The energy you feed into the grid is compensated and accounted for on your electricity bills.\nEffectively, the energy you produce in summer pays for your electricity bill in winter.\nYou can only power a space heater off solar panels if you use net metering.\nNet metering acts as virtual energy storage. In summer, you feed energy into the grid, in winter, you withdraw it.\nIn winter, your solar panels don’t really produce any significant amount of power. But you can spend the money net metering generates in wintertime.\nNet-metering enables the average solar panel owner to even out seasonal electricity over- and underproduction.\nCan off-grid solar panels power an electric space heater? No. While off-grid solar panels can power a space heater in the sunny seasons, they aren’t able to power an electric space heater during the winter. The lack of sun hours combined with the bad weather makes solar-powered electric off-grid heating impossible.\nDoes powering a space heater with a solar panel make sense?\nIf you already have solar panels installed, net metering set up, yes you can run a space heater off your solar panels.\nHowever:\nInstalling solar panels for heating only is not worth it due to the high installation cost and the high electricity consumption of space heaters.\nEspecially if your area does not have net metering setting up 144 solar panels just to power a single space heater in the wintertime is pointless.\nIf you had the money to set up 144 solar panels, you’d probably also not worry about powering space heaters.\nWhat’s the best way to heat off-grid?\nThe best way to heat without electricity (completely off-grid) is wood. I did an experiment and found it is objectively superior to other heating methods because it has the lowest cost per BTU of heat.\nAccording to the experiment’s results, you get up to 8x more heat when using wood as a heat stove, as compared to solar power, for the same amount of money spent. And this does not even factor in the higher cost of installing solar panels vs. installing a wood stove.\nFun-fact:\nHeating with candles is the worst way to heat without electricity. It is 90x more expensive per BTU of heat energy than wood.\nIs propane gas good for heating off-grid? Yes, propane gas is, after wood, the second best way to heat without electricity. When compared with solar power, it is about 2.5x more cost-effective when considering the heat energy (in BTUs) per dollar spent.\nSo, if you don’t have a wood stove yet, I absolutely recommend getting this Mr. Heater Big Buddy propane heater for off-grid heating.\nBoth wood and propane are very cost-effective methods for heating independently of an electric grid.\nBoth propane gas and wood are simple and cheap to store. Especially, when compared to off-grid solar panels, which would require large batteries.\nWe are not at a point yet, where electric heating beats good old gas heating.\nConclusion Yes, solar panels can, theoretically, run a space heater. However, installing solar panels just for heating is not worth it due to the high installation cost.\nAlso, electricity is not a cost-effective way of heating.\nBoth for on-grid and off-grid heating, wood-burning stoves and propane gas are much more cost-effective heating methods.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-run-space-heater-off-solar-panel/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou can run a space heater on solar panel energy.

Whether in an electricity outage or in an off-grid location, it\u0026rsquo;s always good to know the best possible ways to heat a room without electricity.\nIn this article, I\u0026rsquo;ll guide you through the most cost-effective \u0026amp; least energy-intensive ways to heat a room without electricity.\nAfter reading it thoroughly, you\u0026rsquo;ll know plenty of alternative heat sources. Some of them can heat entire houses, like wood, others are emergency heat methods that require next to no energy.\nMethods for Heating that don\u0026rsquo;t require Electricity So, let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the full list of ways to heat without electricity!\n1. Propane Heaters For emergencies such as an energy outage, propane gas is very practical because you can store it over long periods of time. The gas is always available and never degrades.\nPropane gas is cheap and you can fill it up at a local hardware store.\nTo heat using propane gas, I recommend this Mr. Heater propane heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nThis model is sized for large rooms and is able to keep your entire family heated for several days, if not weeks depending on how economically you use the propane.\nThe Mr. Heater propane heater can output 18,000 BTUs per hour, which is the equivalent of 3 electric space heaters on full power.\nThe Mr Heater Buddy is my favorite propane heater!\nSo, how long does it last?\n“A standard-sized 20-pound propane cylinder holds approximately 430,000 BTUs of liquid propane.”\nferrelgas.com\nOn full power settings, the Mr. Heater propane heater drains a 20-pound propane tank in 23.8h. So, it will last you almost one full 24 hours.\nDurability of propane gas heaters However, in emergency situations, you’ll never power the heater on full throttle. You can use it on 3 different heat settings:\nPropane Heater Setting**How long does propane last?**Low (4,000 BTU/h)108 hoursRegular (9,000 BTU/h)48 hoursHigh (18,000 BTU/h)24 hours\nSo, on the lowest 4,000 BTUs per hour setting, which is the equivalent of an electric space heater running on 1,100W of power, you are able to heat for a full 108h continuously.\nThis amount of power is enough to keep an average 150 sq. ft to 250 sq. ft. living room at a comfortable temperature of at least 64°F even in the cold winter.\nIf the 18,000 BTUs rating is too high for your needs, you can also get a smaller version of this model. However, I am a friend of always having the option to produce more heat if needed. You can always turn down the settings to match a lower heat output.\nAccording to learnmetrics.com, refilling a 20 lb propane tank costs $15.17 at $3.90 per gallon.\nDon’t forget you can always keep multiple propane tanks at home!\n2. Wood Burning Heaters Wood is the most independent source of heat. It has multiple advantages. The first is, of course, as we’ve already seen the best cost-efficiency of all heating methods.\nWood produces the most heat per dollar invested. Also, you can stack it and store it for electricity outages.\nHowever, if you use wood as a heat source, you have to put in the work. Preparing a cord of firewood involves transporting wood to your home, cutting, chopping, stacking, and drying it.\nThe more work you do yourself, the less money you will have to spend.\nDue to its large heat capacity, wood is a powerful heat source and well-suited for heating large rooms.\nFor a living room, you need around 1 cord of wood (128 cubic feet, or 3.6 cubic meters) per year. This depends on your desired room temperature and the exact room size.\nHere’s a table listing the number of cords of wood you need per year for different room sizes and target temperatures.\nRoom Temperature150 sq. ft. room300 sq. ft. room450 sq. ft. room65°F (economic)0.5 cords per year1 cord per year1.5 cords per year70°F (normal)1 cord per year1.5 cords per year2 cords per year75°F (comfortable hot)1.5 cords per year2 cords per year2.5 cords per year\nThe forestry department of Utah State University found that you get 27.5 Million BTUs of heat per cord of Beechwood. Oak delivers up to 30.7 million BTUs of heat energy per cord.\nThey are the best types of wood for heating.\nWood-burning heaters (such as this wood stove) are very reliable \u0026amp; outage-safe. But they require installation.\nCost-efficiency of different wood types Here are more types of wood sorted by the heat per cord. Additionally, I researched the cost of each wood species and found which type of wood is the most cost-effective.\nWood SpeciesHeat per Cord (Million BTUs)Cost per Cord (USD)Cost per Million BTU (in USD)Alder17.5$200.00$11.43Apple27$300.00$11.11Ash, Green20$350.00$17.50Aspen18.2$120.00$6.59Beech27.5$300.00$10.91Birch20.8$300.00$14.42Douglas-fir20.7$150.00$7.25Elm20$200.00$10.00Juniper21.8$300.00$13.76Larch21.8$300.00$13.76Locust27.9$300.00$10.75Maple25.5$300.00$11.76Oak26.2$300.00$11.45Pine21.1$120.00$5.69\nAs you see in the table, most sorts of common firewood such as Oak, Birch, and Beech are in the $10 - $14 per Million BTU range.\nPine and Douglas appear very cheap. However, Pine does not grow in areas where firewood is needed.\nAspen is probably that cheap (around $6 - $7 per million BTUs) because it only grows in cold regions, where lots of firewood is available.\nIf you live in a moderately cold climate, your best bet is Oak, Birch, and Beech, which are the most popular kinds of firewood.\nSide fact:\nAll types of wood have a better cost-efficiency than any other heat source we looked at. It does not matter, which type of wood you use. As long as you use wood, you are already getting more heat for your money than with any other heating method.\n3. Body Warmth Animals, especially large ones such as cows produce a significant amount of body heat. However, using live animal bodies’ heat is not an option for most households.\nThat’s why we did not include animals in the final comparison table listed at the beginning of this article. Also, it is very hard to accurately determine the cost of heating with live animals.\nSo, this is just a theoretical investigation:\nOne cow produces 4,500 - 6,000 BTUs per hour ( source). One BTU per hour is around 0.293W. This means a single cow produces anywhere between 1,300W and 1,700W of heating power.\nThat is the equivalent of an electric space heater running on full power.\nWith a 1,500W space heater, I can get my living room toasty warm. It’s incredible that a cow can do the same.\nBut I don’t want a cow in my living room!\nIn an emergency, it\u0026rsquo;s always good to gather the family together. More people create more heat!\n4. Dried plant or animal material Another emergency heat source we have a short look at is dried plants and animal dung.\nI was traveling Nepal with a friend once. In the Himalayan mountains, there is no electricity and no wood for heating. Gas is expensive since it has to be carried up the mountains in heavy bottles.\nThe local’s favorite way of heating is to mix dried plants (grasses, bushes) with dried animal dung (usually cows, horses, and yaks).\nThe everyday hunt for animal dung yielded enough material to get a full evening of heat out of it!\nYou can even mix the dried materials with plant oil for more heat.\nSince all of that is only imaginable in emergency situations, I’ll leave it here as an anecdote and I don’t include it in the cost-efficiency analysis.\nThese simple Nepalese wood stoves are fired with Yak dung!\n5. Candles A candle produces, depending on the model, around 40W to 80W of power. To match the power of a 1,500W space heater, you would need at least 18 80W candles.\nA single candle costs at least $0.05. Out of a candle, you can expect to get 352 BTUs of heat. This results from the heat capacity of candle wax multiplied by the weight of a single tealight. I’ll spare you the details.\nWith a $0.05 tealight and 352 BTUs heat capacity per tealight, the cost for a million BTUs would be $142.04.\nSounds high, right? Especially when we compare it to the $10 - $14 per million BTUs of most wood types.\nHowever, that’s only the lower end of the spectrum.\nCandles are too expensive for heating without electricity In an electricity outage, or in times leading up to electricity outages, the demand for tealights rises sharply. The supply of wax is more limited than the supply of wood.\nThis means that candles either go out of stock, or their prices rise sharply.\nWe’re not in a drastic situation right now. But looking online, I can find several offers for tealights where a single tealight costs $0.26 to $0.33, or even more.\nWith these inflated prices per candle, a million BTUs in candles cost $738.61 to $937.46.\nIn addition to the incredible cost of heating with candles, a single candle burns only 2-3 hours. This means that you will have to constantly change candles. And you’ll end up with a lot of waste.\nI hope you agree with me that heating with candles is absolutely impractical. Even in an emergency.\n6. Flowerpot Heater Flowerpot heaters are a mutated form of heating with plain candles. A lot of people mistakenly think that candles placed below an upside-down flowerpot produce more heat than the candles alone.\nHowever, according to the laws of thermodynamics that is physically impossible. A single tealight has a certain heat capacity.\nChanging the structure around a candle might have a slight impact on how quickly the heat is released, but it does not extract more heat energy from the candle.\nIn physics terms: You can change the burning power of a candle, but not the heat energy stored inside.\nIf you manage to build a flowerpot heater that makes candles burn with more power, this just causes the candles to burn up more quickly, leaving you with a net zero effect.\nStill, I wrote a full article on how to build a terracotta clay pot heater, analyzing different types of candles, types of flowerpots and checking the physical possibilities.\nHave a look, if you are interested.\nFor heating a room without electricity, a flowerpot heater definitely works. However, the cost of heating with candles is too high and other options such as propane or wood are a lot more practical.\nFlowerpot heaters are trending. But candles produce only little heat and are comparably expensive!\n7. Run a space heater off a generator You can run a space heater off a generator. However, this will quickly drain your fuel supply. To heat without electricity, you should rather power an electric blanket off your generator.\nElectric blankets consume only around 50W, which is significantly less than the 1,500W required to run a space heater.\nA generator lasts 30x longer if you use an electric blanket instead of a space heater.\n8. Power bank plus electric heating blanket Let’s assume you have a power bank at hand. How much heat can you get out of a fully charged power bank?\nFirst of all, most large power banks have a capacity of 20,000mAh. If your power bank is able to supply a 5V load, then the overall capacity (in Watt-hours) is 20,000mAh / 5V = 100Wh.\nWith 100Wh you could power a 50W electric blanket on full power for 2 hours.\nThe cost of charging a 100Wh power bank is $0.03 at most. This is even a slight overestimate since the official US average electricity rate is $0.14 per kWh. I like to use conservative numbers, so I assumed $0.30 per kWh.\nThis results in a cost-efficiency of $87.98 per million BTUs. That’s quite a high number, somewhere in between propane gas and candles.\nHowever, with an electric blanket powered off a generator, you don’t heat the entire room, but just one person directly. So, instead of dispersing each BTU of heat energy in your room’s air, you apply it directly to a person’s body.\nThis is a significant difference since you feel each BTU immediately. And that’s why I conclude:\nElectric blankets powered off a power bank have a relatively high cost per BTU due to high electricity rates. However, because the electric blanket directly touches you, each BTU feels a lot warmer than with other heating methods (which heat the air instead). Electric blankets powered off a power bank (or generator) are, therefore, a very efficient way to keep warm without electricity.\n9. Generator or power bank plus terrarium heater You can achieve the same effect as with heating with an electric blanket using a terrarium heater.\nTerrarium heaters are thin heating stripes that you can put on the floor and put your feet on them.\nSo, they are like electric blankets, but just for the feet.\nActually, they were made for heating terrariums, but why not use them in an emergency?\nHere’s why I include them in this article:\nOne terrarium heater consumes as little as 7W of power. That’s only a tiny fraction (\u0026lt;1%) of what an electric space heater consumes. And it’s just 14% the power of an average electric blanket.\nThis means that it will last you 7x longer than an electric blanket.\nIn an extreme emergency, you can connect a terrarium heater to a power bank and heat your feet for many hours, if not days, before the energy runs out. On a generator, a terrarium heater will last months!\nThe cost-efficiency of a terrarium heater in combination with a power bank or generator matches the cost-efficiency of an electric blanket and it directly depends on your personal electricity rate.\n2 Principles to Heat Effectively without Electricity In an emergency, when you have to heat your room without electricity, you want two things\nstay warm spend as little of your heat resources as possible Here’s how you can do that:\nFirst Principle: Heat the person, not the room The most important principle to heat without electricity as cheap and economically as possible is to heat the person, not the room.\nThis means:\nAlways sit directly in front of the heat source. The heat has to radiate directly toward your body.\nAlways prefer conductive heating methods (such as electric blankets, hot water bottles, or merely touching the stone slabs in front of your wood stove with your feet), over whole-room heating methods.\nThe air in your room is an insulator. To heat effectively without electricity, prefer to heat only rooms where people are present. Avoid heating empty spaces.\nYou can even convert general whole-room heating methods to conductive heating methods:\nHeat a hot water bottle using your wood-burning stove Sit directly in front of a heat source Touch stone slabs (or something else that absorbs heat) directly in front of your heat source with your feet Second Principle: Dress warmly Not only should you always aim to apply the heat directly to your body, you should also dress warmly to keep the heat.\nWool and cotton are great for heat retention. Prefer heavy materials over light ones.\nDon’t be afraid of wearing 3-4 layers on your upper and lower body.\nAnd don’t forget to insulate your feet well: Two pairs of socks are better than just one.\nWear a hat if it’s very cold.\nFurther Analysis: Cost Of Different Heat Sources A wood-burning stove is the most cost-effective way to heat a room without electricity with just $10.91 per Million BTUs. The second best option is propane gas with $35.28 per Million BTUs. For emergencies, wood is the preferable resource. For installation-less use, a propane heater is the better heater choice.\nThe table below lists the capacity (in BTUs) of different loads of heat sources. Additionally, you’ll find the cost for a full refill. And accordingly, the cost-efficiency, which measures the cost (in Dollars) to get a million BTUs of the heat source in question.\n**Heat Source****Cost Per Unit Of Heat (in $ per Million BTU)**Wood$11Propane$35Electricity$87Candles$142\nThe data for more types of wood is listed in the section about wood heating further below. You can check the sort of wood that is most available in your area there.\nFor the power bank values, I assumed a load of 5V (for hooking up a USB heating blanket) and an electricity rate of $0.30 per kWh for charging. This is a conservative estimate and more than double the current US average of $0.14 per kWh.\nFrom the data collected, you immediately see that heating with wood is the most cost-effective way to heat a room without electricity. On the other hand, heating with candles is financially unfeasible.\nFor the candle data, I even used the cheapest tealight models I could find (from Walmart, which is $5 for 100 tealights). Still, it’s by far the most expensive way to heat a room without electricity.\nIf you use more expensive tealights, the cost-efficiency degrades quickly. Tealights that cost $0.26 - $0.33 have a cost-efficiency of $700 - $900 per million BTUs. Horrible. Never heat with candles if you want to get the most value for your money!\nTealights are 10x to 90x more expensive than wood and 4x to 25x more expensive than propane gas.\nHow to Keep Safe Heating without Electricity With wood-burning or fuel-burning heating methods comes the risk of toxic gas accumulation in your room.\nMake sure to vent your room occasionally to let fresh oxygen in.\nAlso, make sure that the heater you use is well-built and, ideally, certified. Most certified propane heaters and wood stoves are adjusted for an “ideal burn”, which burns wood or gas without waste materials and without toxic gases.\nWhen using a heating blanket or a terrarium heater for your feet, avoid hot water bottles to reduce the risk of an electric shock.\nConclusion The most cost-effective and versatile method to heat a room without electricity is a wood-burning stove.\nThe second best off-grid heating method in an energy outage is propane gas, which is similarly affordable.\nIf you don’t have a wood-burning stove available, always keep a propane heater with a 20-lb propane tank around. This saves you the installation cost of a wood stove.\nIf you do have a wood stove, then always keep at least half a cord of firewood around your house or cabin. Even if you don’t actively use it. In an electricity outage, you’ll be happy to be prepared.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-heat-room-without-electricity/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSometimes you have to keep warm without electricity.

With space heaters, you’ll pay around $54 - $108 a month.\nIt’s never easy to find a heat source that is well-suited for large rooms. Either you have to pay a lot, or it’s hard to install.\nGenerally, you can always turn up your central heater’s temperature settings. However, that increases your heating bill significantly. Central heating heats the entire home and, therefore, produces more heat than is needed for a single room.\nSo, we’re looking at alternative methods\nWe’re going to check different methods for different situations. I promise, you’ll find at least one method that suits your needs:\nheating methods that require no installation work heating methods that require installation work heating methods that assume your house is still in planning / construction Also, we’re checking how to distribute heat in a large room once you settled for a heating method.\nQuick answer: A wood-burning stove is the most cost-effective method to heat a large room. Alternatively, use one or two space heaters to supply heat in your large room. If your house is still in construction, consider combining radiant floor heating with a heat pump.\nLet’s check each large room-heating method individually and find out the cost and effort to set it up and run it.\nHow to heat a large room without installation work The simplest, safest, and most reliable method of heating a large room without installation work is with electric space heaters.\nAn average space heater consumes 1,500W of power. Accordingly, it produces 1,500W of heat. This amount is sufficient to keep even large rooms well-heated.\nFor very large rooms, you should consider getting two space heaters.\nThere are different types of space heaters you could use:\nRegular oil-filled radiators: Heats the air in the entire room. The heat feels very comfortable, matching the feeling of central heating. Infrared heaters: Infrared heaters produce heat by radiating infrared heat waves. They radiate the heat in just one direction. Infrared heaters heat the objects they are directed towards. They don’t heat the air. With infrared heaters, you have more control over where the heat goes. This increases their perceived efficiency.\nBy placing your infrared heater properly, you maximize heat utilization! (the amount of heat that reaches you)\nOn a theoretical basis, they are, however, not more or less efficient than other types of electric space heaters. Where to place space heaters in a large room From a physic’s point of view, the placement of heaters does not matter. According to the laws of thermodynamics, all heat will end up evenly distributed in the entire room if you wait for enough time.\nHowever, in the heating period when your room is still cold and the heaters are slowly getting hotter, there will be a temperature gradient in the room.\nIt’s similar to sitting next to a fireplace: The immediate surroundings of the fire are warm, however, the large open outdoor space is still cold.\nYou can use space heater placement to lower the initial temperature gradient.\nOil-filled radiator placement for large rooms Oil heaters can generally be placed anywhere in the room. They radiate heat relatively evenly around the room. However, a lot of hot air rises upward to the ceiling. If you have a tilted ceiling, it is, therefore, always practical to place your oil-filled radiator below the tilted ceiling, which helps distribute the air. But that’s just a slight theoretical improvement.\nWith oil-filled radiators, placement is not that important.\nInfrared heater placement for large rooms With infrared heaters, placement is very important, since they output heat in just one direction. Therefore, always make sure that your infrared heater faces either\ninto the room or into the area where people sit Never face an infrared heater towards or in parallel to a window. A significant portion of the heat will penetrate through the window and is wasted, which decreases the heating efficiency.\nIf you have two space heaters, prefer to place them at opposite ends of the room. There are two reasons.\nThe first reason is that heat is distributed more evenly. By having space heaters in opposite corners of the room, the chance of cold space in your large room decreases.\nThe second reason is that there’s a chance opposite sides of large rooms use two different electrical circuits. By connecting space heaters to separate circuits, the chance of overloading your home’s circuitry decreases. Most circuits can handle two space heaters simultaneously.\nHowever, in that case, you are operating at the very limit, and running a TV, computer, or any other appliance becomes a game of chance.\nIf you don’t have enough wall outlets to plug heaters in opposite ends of the large room, consider getting a well-built heavy-duty extension cord for space heaters.\nCost of heating with space heaters An average 1500W space heater costs $54 to run per month assuming you run 8 hours a day with an average electricity rate of 14 cents per kWh according to the space heater running cost article.\nThe assumed electricity rate is the US average. However, depending on where you live, your personal electricity rate may vary. You can check your personal electricity rate on your recent electricity bill.\nHow many space heaters does your room need?\nYou need one space heater per 150 square feet. Space heaters are very good at adapting to room size since most models have a built-in thermostat.\nThe thermostat senses the room temperature and adjusts the heat output. At 150 square feet, a space heater usually maxes out its heating capabilities and you will need additional space heaters.\nStill, before you buy multiple space heaters, here’s my personal estimate of how many space heaters you need to heat your large room. The estimates are conservative. Buy a space heater, and see how well it heats. And if it’s not heating enough, get an additional heater.\nRoom size (sq ft)Number of heatersMonthly running cost1501$542001$543002$1084002$1085003$162\nHow to heat a large room (with installation work required) Space heaters are the best choice for heating if you don’t want to put in any work. If, however, you are willing to either hire someone to install additional heaters, or you are willing to do the installation work yourself, here’s what I recommend:\nTo heat a large room, a wood stove or fireplace with a wood stove insert is the most effective method. Wood stoves output a lot of heat. Also, you have control over the heating cost if you chop firewood yourself. However, you need to install the stove and maintain it.\nHeat large rooms using a wood stove Contrasting other types of heaters which are limited to a maximum electric power consumption, wood stoves are scalable. The more wood you put in, the more heat they produce.\nOf course, there’s a size limit. However, most wood stoves are capable to heat large rooms to very comfortable temperatures.\nThe amount of heat a wood stove produces is controllable using an air valve that controls the airflow into the burning chamber.\nYou can, therefore, use wood stoves to produce a lot of heat, or you can use them to heat economically.\nConsider a wood-burning stove if you can prepare wood yourself With a wood stove, you have to organize resources yourself. Of course, you can order a truckload of chopped and dried firewood. However, that’s expensive.\nThe more work you put into preparing your own wood, the cheaper it gets. For example, you can chop wood yourself. You can dry it yourself. And you can even transport it from the forests yourself if you live in a rural area.\nI find the sweet spot for minimum cost and effort while getting the most wood is to order a truck of trunks right to your home.\nThen, take care of cutting, chopping, and drying yourself. You can save thousands of dollars this way! However, you’ll spend a week or two each year chopping firewood in your free time.\nIf that’s something for you, wood stoves are great!\nCost of installing and heating with a wood stove The cost of wood-burning stove installation varies greatly depending on your circumstances.\nHere’s a quick table with standard quotes for different work:\nCost of wood stove installation\nWork****CostWood stove$300 - $900(optional) Building a chimney if not present$1000 - $3000(optional) Install chimney liner for improved efficiency$700 - $2000(optional) Stove accessories$50 - $200\nCost of heating with wood Heating with wood starts from $0 per year if you have free access to wood and do all the work yourself. And it goes up to $3,000 per year if you order chopped, dried, and stacked wood.\nThe exact cost of heating with wood depends on your location and the resulting accessibility of wood, how much you heat, how efficient your wood stove is, and how much work you put in yourself.\nWith a decent EPA-certified wood-burning stove, you can expect yearly wood cost between $910 to $1820. If you cut the wood yourself you can pay as low as $300. This includes wood delivery to your home.\nYou can reduce your yearly wood heating cost to a fraction of said cost if you put the work in yourself.\nHere’s how much you can expect to pay based on how much work you put in:\nWork you do yourself****Yearly heating cost for large roomsNothing, everything is delivered fully prepared to your houseup to $3,000Stack and dry woodup to $2,000Chop wood, stack, and dryup to $1,500Cut large tree trunks, chop, stack, and dryup to $800Transport wood from the forest, cut, chop, stack, and dry (100% DIY)between $0 to $300\nThis year\u0026rsquo;s heating cost for our family is around $300 since we get whole tree trunks delivered and process (chop, stack, and dry) the wood ourselves.\nAs you see, the more work you do, the cheaper heating with wood gets. Which makes it a very cost-effective method of heating large rooms.\nImprove fireplace efficiency using fireplace inserts If you already have an open fireplace, consider getting a fireplace insert. A fireplace insert massively improves your fireplace’s efficiency and heat output.\nA fireplace insert transforms a regular fireplace into a very well-suited heater for large rooms.\nFireplaces lose 90% of heat through the chimney. A fireplace insert retains the heat and radiates it into the room, just like a stove.\nThese inserts cost up to $4,500 to install. However, they usually pay for themselves within 3 years of heating.\nImprove your large room\u0026rsquo;s insulation Before you install overly powerful heaters in your home, ensure your insulation is well set up. A well-insulated room reduces your heating bill long term. It’s a one-off expense that will pay for itself.\nYou can check if there’s a government incentive for installing insulation. Usually, it’s in the form of reimbursement or tax write-offs.\nThe most cost-efficient form of insulation is attic insulation. Attic insulation is cheap because you just need to cover your attic’s floor or the roof with styrofoam or a reflective insulation shield.\nA 2 ft. by 50 ft. insulation roll costs around $65, so for most attics, 2-3 rolls, which would be $130 - $195, should be enough to improve insulation significantly.\nHeat large rooms using floor heating combined with a heat pump (best for houses in construction) For houses in construction, consider adding radiant floor heating. It even adds resell value to your house.\nHere, you can also check for government incentives. Radiant floor heating combines well with heat pumps. A heat pump has to use less power with floor heating because the heat does not have to be pumped above floor level.\nThis increases the overall heat efficiency of your home.\nRadiant floor heating is well-suited for large rooms since the heat is evenly distributed throughout the room.\nHowever, it’s very expensive to set up and only feasible during house construction. Additionally, I assume that floor heating, if improperly insulated, directs a lot of heat into the walls of the house instead of into the room. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches your living space.\nAlso, it’s very slow.\nI am not a fan of floor heating.\nFloor heating installation cost An average large radiant floor heating installation costs around $2,400.\nRoom size (sq ft)Floor heating installation cost150$1,800200$2,400300$3,600400$4,800500$6,000\nI assumed an installation cost of $12 per square foot.\nFloor heating running cost A radiant floor heater’s running cost depends on the source of heat. With a heat pump, you can estimate a monthly heating cost of $54 - $108 for a large room. Without a heat pump, you pay double.\nHow to distribute heat in large rooms In general, fans are great for distributing heat in large rooms.\nFloor and pedestal fans To distribute heat in a large room, use a floor fan. Floor fans can move large volumes of air with relatively low noise.\nAlso, they look good and suit well in most rooms.\nYou can also use a pedestal fan. However, most pedestal fans are ugly. And due to their smaller blades, they are noisier and have to rotate faster to move the same amount of air.\nWood stove fans Wood stove fans are fans you place on top of a wood stove. The heat energy rotates the fan blades of the wood stove fan which creates a light airflow and helps distribute the heat a little.\nSome people even assume that wood stove fans improve the efficiency of a wood stove. This, however, has no physical ground and is false,\nFor large rooms, wood stove fans are only a fancy gimmick and not really something that helps distribute the heat\nCheck my article on why wood stove fans are not worth it.\nConclusion To heat a large room, use space heaters, a wood stove, or radiant floor heating. The most effective method is wood-burning stoves, since they are very cheap to run and can produce a lot of heat.\nSpace heaters are convenient since they are portable and heat up a large room quickly. Radiant floor heating is expensive to install and not as efficient. It’s only worth it if you are still constructing your house and you can combine it with a heat pump.\nYou can find everything summed up in this quick video where I talk about my favorite ways to heat large rooms:\nhttps://youtu.be/RINGvedYAbg\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-heat-a-large-room/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo heat a large room using wood can be as cheap as $300 a year.

However, you obviously cannot let yourself freeze to death. I\u0026rsquo;ve got some pretty good alternatives for you that will heat your space without using a heater. How amazing would that be?\nQuick answer: You can heat a room without a heater using candles, running electronics, an electric blanket, a hair dryer, or simply wearing warm clothing. The cheapest method to heat a room is using a low-wattage infrared heater since it bundles heat radiation.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s not waste any more time and start on ways to heat your room without using a heater.\n1. Heat Using Candles Using candles to heat your room may appear inexpensive, but this is not the case.\nCandles may, without a doubt, generate heat fairly effectively. Although it doesn\u0026rsquo;t heat a space as effectively as a real heater, considering that one candle has an 80W heating power, it nevertheless manages to warm a room adequately.\nThe maximum number of candles you might need to heat a space effectively is 20, after which you\u0026rsquo;re set to go.\nGetting 20 candles may seem like no great deal since it won\u0026rsquo;t cost you much, and you can purchase them easily from any nearby supermarket. But hang on…\nConsider the duration of a candle\u0026rsquo;s burn. As for how long a candle will burn, it depends on its size, but after they are all used up, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to replace them with new ones. And since you will need to buy numerous candles, replacing them would not be inexpensive anymore.\nWhatever the situation, I believe that heating your room with candles is not the best alternative. It is advised not to light too many candles in confined spaces with poor air circulation because doing so can result in a fire hazard.\nHere are a few suggestions to bear in mind if you\u0026rsquo;re still considering using candles to heat your room:\nWatch where you set the candles to prevent anything from catching fire in your room. Keep the candles out while you are sleeping. Don\u0026rsquo;t let the candles burn unattended. Last but not least, remember to put the candles in a candle holder. 2. Heat Using a Clay Pot Heater Heating your room with a clay pot heater is similar to heating with candles because both methods require candles.\nAs the name implies, you utilize two to three clay pots and stack them on top of one another. You place a candle within the pot, which concentrates the heat from the candle flame into one spot and then radiates it forth. It produces a surprising amount of heat.\n» I have created a detailed guide on How to Build Terracotta Clay Pot Heater\nThe best thing is that it is the simplest and least expensive DIY project and produces excellent heating results.\nHowever, as there are many advantages, there are also some disadvantages. When numerous candles are placed together, the melted paraffin wax from all of them can ignite. Furthermore, when the pots become hot, touching them might cause burns.\n3. Turn On Lights Did you know that the light bulb produces 95% more heat than light? How incredible.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to leave the bulbs and lamps open because they will produce heat, especially if they are red and yellow.\nHowever, since it isn\u0026rsquo;t a proper method of heating, it will definitely not be as efficient as a heater. In addition, opening so many lights in your room may result in a higher electricity bill. Plus, you can\u0026rsquo;t keep the lights on at all times in case you want to sleep.\nAlso, if a high-wattage light is left on for a long period of time, there is a chance that it could overheat, which might lead to sockets melting or even the burning of wires.\n4. Absorb Heat Using Dark Window Shades Dark window shades trap heat in the room. These shades lessen the amount of heat that is transmitted through the window.\nTherefore, you might choose dark window coverings to keep the heat inside your room.\nTo trap it, you must first heat the room, which you can do by using the other options listed in the article.\n5. Heat Using an Electric Blanket An electric blanket is a modern innovation that works well to warm you rather than the entire room. Additionally, it is quite comfortable and energy-efficient. They cost significantly less to operate than an expensive, unreliable heater.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about obtaining an electric blanket, be careful not to put anything over it because doing so could make it overheat, pose a fire risk, or even lead you to get burned.\nUnfortunately, if you\u0026rsquo;re searching for a means to heat up your room because you have to work or whatever and don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend the day wrapped in a blanket, this alternative may not be the best option for you.\nFurthermore, it contributes to pregnancy-related hyperthermia, so it is not advised for those who are expecting.\n6. Improve Your Room’s Insulation I must say that upgrading your room\u0026rsquo;s insulation will fix your heating problem. Let\u0026rsquo;s go over some methods by which you can insulate your space.\nUse Draft Stoppers When your windows or doors have cracks or openings, the air from outside is exchanged and cools your space. You can use draft stoppers to prevent this from happening. One option is to roll up a thick towel and lay it beneath the door or the bottom of the window.\nSeal Air Leaks In order to stop cold air from entering, you can also seal the air leaks or place weatherstripping between the window frame and stash. You can use plastic film to cover the windows and keep them from freezing.\nSwitch the Window Coverings Additionally, you can choose a bright color for your curtains or blinds to escape the winter aura or convert to thicker or insulated window coverings that will keep the chilly air out.\n7. Move Hot Objects Into the Room You can move hot objects in your room to allow them to emit heat into the space. A wood stove or a hot water bottle are two examples of such objects.\nHot Water Bottle Despite its size, a hot water bottle performs effectively. It can be tucked under your sheets and keeps your feet warm. A hot water bottle won\u0026rsquo;t be very helpful if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to warm up more than one area or part of your body, though, since it acts more like a heat pack and simply warms the area or part of your body where you set it.\nWood Stove A room may be efficiently heated by a wood stove owing to its strong heating capacity. Although it evenly spreads the warm air, it has a few drawbacks.\nBoth indoor and outdoor pollution from wood stoves can result in major health concerns like breathing difficulties, heart attacks, lung cancer, and other conditions.\nTherefore, avoiding using a wood stove is best if you or anybody else in your home has health issues.\n8. Buy a New Heater So what if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a built-in heater? Consider using a portable space heater instead. There are various kinds of space heaters, including infrared and oil-filled radiators.\nAn oil-filled heater focuses on heating your room evenly and more forcefully, whilst an infrared heater provides fast heating.\nAn oil-filled heater is recommended if you plan to use it in your bedroom.\nThese space heaters unquestionably give safe and dependable heat and are an excellent option if you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about buying one, but they also have certain don\u0026rsquo;ts that you need to be aware of.\nTo avoid contact between the two, do not set the heater close to the bedding. Do not leave a space heater unattended in a child\u0026rsquo;s room. Also Read: 5 Space Heaters You Can Leave Unattended\nEven though a modern space heater is very safe to use for extended periods of time, even while sleeping, check to see if it has a safety function that immediately switches it off in an instance that the heater tips over or overheats.\n9. Wear Warm Clothes Wearing additional layers of clothing is one technique to stay warm if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a heater for your room. The truth is that wearing so many layers when at home might be irritating, even though adding more layers can make you feel warmer and insulate your body.\nNonetheless, here are some tips for staying warm with extra clothing:\nPut on a thermal base layer. Add a sweatshirt or hoodie on top. Put on clothing made of cotton, fleece, or wool. Not to mention, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to put on some thick socks and a woolen beanie. 10. Warm-Up Bedding Let\u0026rsquo;s just accept that spending the day in a warm, comfy bed is something we would all sacrifice anything for. And what else could you possibly desire in the winter?\nAnother great way to remain warm is to increase the heat in your bed. Yes, it won\u0026rsquo;t warm the room, but as long as it keeps you toasty, I\u0026rsquo;ll consider it a perfect substitute.\nHere are some options for warming up your bedding:\nPurchase High-Quality Blankets A warm blanket on top of your sheets will keep you cozy. Get a heavy blanket or a comforter and curl up in it. However, you should be aware that blankets alone won\u0026rsquo;t keep you warm because they act as a heat trap, which is useless if there isn\u0026rsquo;t any heat, to begin with.\nTherefore, as mentioned earlier, you can put a hot water bottle inside your blanket or even blow dry your sheets to release heat before trapping it with a high-quality blanket.\nPurchase a Bed Heater The best investment you can make is a bed heater. It instantly warms the bed and blows air directly under your sheets. Even though it is quite pricey, it is worthwhile because it saves energy and money compared to a real heater.\n11. Heat by Running Electronics Running electronics generate heat. The energy that is produced inside the devices is converted into heat. Gaming systems, TVs, laptops, and other devices are a few examples.\nOperating a 130W PC generates the same heat as running a 130W space heater. How convenient to use your computer for work and as a heater simultaneously.\nWhat’s the Safest Way to Heat a Room Without a Heater? Insulating your room is the safest method to heat it without using a heater. There is no chance of an electric shock, overheating, or anything else to worry about because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t consume electricity.\nSimply seal off the openings where cold air enters the room to prevent it from getting in, and then heat the space once using any method you choose to create a warm setting. The great advantage is that you won\u0026rsquo;t need to use electrical devices or methods for very long before you start worrying about hazards.\nYou only need to heat your room once and cover any drafts; you\u0026rsquo;re good to go!\nWhat’s the Cheapest Way to Heat a Room Without a Heater? The most affordable method of heating a room is with a space heater. Since there are different kinds of space heaters, the infrared heater is the most affordable. They operate with fewer watts and provide heat quickly because they immediately radiate after turning on.\nSpace heaters are relatively inexpensive if you turn down your central heating and they can be used to heat a single room. They are available in various sizes and styles; some even come with features such as timers and remote controls.\nSpace heaters can be placed on the floor or a table, and they typically use electricity to generate heat.\nAlso read: 20 Cheapest Ways to Cool a Room \u0026amp; House\nWhich Method Of Heating Your Room Produces the Most Heat? A wood stove can generate the most heat for your room because even a small wood stove can heat up to 500 square feet . It also poses the greatest risks for health problems, but well, that is another case.\nConclusion Close all of your home\u0026rsquo;s unused doors before heating up your room to keep the cold air from sneaking in and adequately insulate your entire home, and especially your room.\nIf your room is still chilly, you have a lot of options in the article to heat it up. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to be concerned because you can now stay warm and toasty in your room.\nWant even more ideas on heating a room without a heater?

And if yes, how? Space heaters use a lot of electricity. Nevertheless, you can use them to increase your home’s heating efficiency.\nIn this article, we are going to cover how you can cut your heating bill using space heaters!\nQuick answer: Space heaters save you at least $162 yearly if you reduce your central heater’s temperature by more than 8°F (4.4°C) and supply heat using two space heaters. If you use just one space heater to supply heat, your heating bill is reduced by at least $324 a year.\nLet’s have a closer look and see how space heaters can save you money. Also, we’re going to look at different scenarios and see when heating with space heaters is worth it and when it isn’t!\nSaving money using space heaters might sound impossible. Space heaters are known to consume a lot of electricity. Running an average 1500W space heater costs $54 if you use it for 8 hours every day ( source).\nStill, it is possible to save money using space heaters. Let’s have a look at how.\nCentral Heat: The Main Cause Of High Heating Bills First off, we have to understand what causes high heating and utility bills.\nThe main source of a house’s heat is the central heating system. The central heating system can be based on oil, gas, wood, or electricity.\nIt does not really matter which of those resources you use in your home. Since the central heating system supplies heat for the entire house, it automatically is the biggest cost factor.\nOn your central heating system, you can set target temperatures for your home. The higher the temperature you set, the higher the resulting heating bill.\nWhen does Central Heating make sense? Almost everyone uses central heating as a sole source of heat. The central heating heats up the entire house. Of course, there are room-local heat sources such as radiators or air vents connected to the central heating system. You use these to adjust temperatures for individual rooms.\nCentral heating is only worth it if the house’s size suits the number of people living and moving inside.\nLet me break this sentence down:\nYour house has several rooms. The rooms should always be used. Unused rooms do not need to be heated as much. Also, people move around the house. Ideally, the central heating should keep frequented rooms warm while unused rooms stay cooler.\nCentral heating does not make sense if the house is too big for the number of people living inside, or if only a subset of rooms is used.\nHow to Save Central Heat Money Using Space Heaters To save money using space heaters, turn down the central heating temperature settings and supply heat with space heaters only to the rooms you are using.\nThe advantage of this is that space heaters are portable. You can bring them with you anywhere you go. Or you can scatter them around the house.\nThrough proper space heater placement, you can also influence the heat flow and the direction of heat radiation. For example, by properly placing an infrared heater to face directly toward you, you increase the amount of heat that reaches your body.\nIn addition to being able to turn down central heat, properly placed space heaters improve the perceived heating efficiency of your home.\nIn comparison, by using the fixed wall radiators or air vents from your central heating system, you have no control over where the heat goes.\nLet’s check how much money you can save using space heaters.\n1. Reduce Central Heating Temperature In this section, we are going to estimate how much money you can save by turning down central heat and supplying heat using space heaters!\nTo get the final result, we have to first find out how much money turning down central heating saves. Then we check how much running space heaters costs. And in the end, we check if turning down the central heat plus running a space heater is cheaper than running central heat alone.\nHow much money does reducing central heating save? Let’s check how much heating a whole house using central heating on comfortable heat settings costs.\nBecause each home varies in size, I’ll use percentages first. Let’s assume that running a home on comfortable central heat settings corresponds to 100% cost.\nAccording to WWF, reducing the central heating’s set temperature by just one degree Celsius cuts your heating bill by 10%. A temperature difference of 1°C corresponds to 1.8°F.\nSo, reducing your central heating by one degree Fahrenheit cuts your heating bill by 5.6%.\nI’ll not take that number for granted, since it is published by WWF, which is an environmental protection organization, and therefore its research is biased toward exaggerating numbers.\nAccording to energyhub.com, reducing your heating settings by 1 degree saves at least 3% on your heating bill.\nProbably the reality is somewhere between 3 - 5.6%.\nCentral heating savings calculated Let’s technically estimate our own percentage as well just to make sure (skip this part if it’s too confusing). For our calculation, we need the heat capacity (CP or Cv) values of air.\n“The nominal values used for air at 300 K are CP = 1.00 kJ/kg. K, Cv = 0.718 kJ/kg”\naccording to ohio.edu\nThat means to heat 1kg of air in a fixed volume environment (a room), you’d need around 1kJ of energy.\nFor wintertime, a good estimate could be that the temperature difference between outside and indoors is 20 Kelvin (around 20°C or 37°F).\nAccordingly, without heating, your indoor space would be cold and you would need no energy.\nTo heat your space to a comfortable temperature in a perfectly insulated room you would need an energy of 20K × 1kJ/kg = 20kJ/kg. In comparison, heating it one Kelvin less, you would need only 19kJ/kg of energy. That’s a reduction of 5%.\nCorrespondingly, our own experiment’s result states that a reduction of 1°F cuts your heating bill by 2,8% in a perfectly sealed and insulated room.\nIn a real environment, however, rooms are not perfectly insulated and heat leaves the room. For each additional degree you heat, the temperature difference between inside and outside increases. The bigger this temperature gradient is, the more heat leaves the room.\nTherefore, I assume the WWF estimate of 5.6%, even though it is double the theoretical value we calculated.\nTo save money with space heaters, you have to reduce central heat. Otherwise, you just add space heater expenses on top of central heating expenses!\nExample calculation: How much can you save by reducing central heating by 5 degrees? By reducing a home’s central heating temperature by 5 degrees, you reduce your heating bill by 25.03%.\nYou can calculate this yourself using this formula:\n1-1×(1-0.056)^5 = 0.2503\nHow much money does reducing central heating save? Inflation drives prices quickly, so it’s very hard to find up-to-date numbers.\nAccording to a National Energy Assistance Director’s Association estimate, the average US family pays $1,202 on heating bills per year.\nThis average includes different heating resources such as natural gas, oil, electricity, or propane.\nHeating oil is the most expensive of all and costs $2,115 a year. Meanwhile, natural gas is the cheapest and costs $952 a year.\nPersonally, I expect average US heating bills to be significantly higher than these official values. But let’s stick to them for now.\nBy reducing your central heater\u0026rsquo;s temperature by just 4°F, you can save up to $435.43 a year.\nI’ve done the calculations for you:\nHeat reduction (°F)Minimum savingsMaximum savings1$53.31$118.442$103.64$230.254$195.99$435.438$351.64$781.2116$573.39$1,273.87\nAccording to the table above, you obviously save more, the more you decrease your central heating bill. However, at some point reducing the temperature stops making sense.\nA temperature reduction of 16°F for example would be very uncomfortable. It might even harm your house by accelerating mold growth and moisture buildup.\nHowever, the main message is that even slight decreases in temperature, such as 1°F, 2°F, or 4°F already significantly cut your heating bill!\n2. Use Space Heaters to Supply Heat Where it\u0026rsquo;s Needed This is where space heaters come into play. You can reduce your central heater’s temperature settings and supply heat using space heaters.\nSince one 1,500W costs about $54 per month to run (for an average US electricity rate of 14 cents per kWh), we have to ensure that the savings are larger than the space heater expenses.\nI’ve done the calculation for you. Here’s how many space heaters you can run for the 3 cold winter months for 8 hours every day:\nHeat reduction (°F)Average savingsAmount of space heaters1$85.8802$166.9414$315.7118$566.43316$923.635\nThe average central heating bill savings come from combining the minimum and maximum values from the previous table. The rightmost column tells you how many space heaters you can run based on those savings.\nIf you run the listed amount of space heaters in your home, then you break even and have the same total expenses as running the central heating alone.\nHowever, for each space heater that you spare, you save $54 × 3 winter months = $162.\nAnd here it starts getting interesting:\nSpace heaters will only save you money if you reduce your central heating’s temperature by more than 8°F (or 4.4°C) and use 2 or fewer space heaters to supply heat in your home.\nUsing Space Heaters to Save Money: When does it make sense? It can make sense to save money using space heaters if you are a very comfortable person and you have set a high central heating temperature.\nThen, reducing by 8°F and supplementing heat where needed is not an issue.\nHowever, saving money using space heaters does not make sense if your central heating is already set to a low temperature.\nThen, an additional 8°F reduction gets uncomfortable quickly and enhances mold growth in your home.\nAlways make sure to keep your home at 64°F or higher. Don’t reduce your central heating settings below that.\nThis means you can only really save money using space heaters if your home’s central heating temperature setting is currently set to 72°F or higher.\nIf your central heat settings are below that, then the savings are not sufficient for running a space heater.\nOther Highly Effective Ways to Save Heating Costs Before trying to save money on your heating bill using space heaters, there are other optimizations you should check.\n1. Improve your house\u0026rsquo;s insulation First of all, make sure your home is well-insulated. A well-insulated home not only keeps the warmth for much longer. It also takes less heat energy and, therefore, also less money to raise your room temperature.\nInsulation is the most cost-effective way to keep your house warm. The main benefit is that it is a one-off task.\nImprove insulation once and it will reduce your heating bills forever. Additionally, insulation is maintenance-free. There are no moving parts, nothing that can break. And usually, it is very doable for most handymen.\n2. Insulate your attic The one insulation that is oftentimes overlooked is attic insulation. The attic specifically loses a lot of heat in the wintertime as the heat from your living space rises upward and, therefore, always passes through the attic.\nAn insulated roof and attic keep warm air in the wintertime.\nAlso, attic insulation is one of the cheapest forms of insulation, because it does not have to look good! It’s your attic. Just place styrofoam along the attic floor and attach a layer below the roof and you’re done.\nIn addition to keeping the heat in the wintertime, attic and roof insulation hold the cold air in the summertime and prevent your house from heating up. This additionally reduced your air conditioning electricity costs in the summertime.\n3. Improvised insulation If you don’t have the opportunity or funds to insulate your home’s walls, attic, and roof, you can still do something.\nEspecially when supplying heat using space heaters, you can block the airways below doors. Most of the heat in your room leaves through door gaps.\nJust put a blanket in front of your door gaps and you’ve significantly improved your room’s insulation for free!\nOf course, make sure to vent your room occasionally to get some fresh air. I am doing this very thing right now!\nConclusion Space heaters can save you money if you reduce your central heater’s settings by around 8°F or more and supply heat using space heaters where you need it.\nIf you can’t reduce your central heater’s settings that much because of elderly people or a family in your house, saving money with space heaters is hardly possible.\nWithout reducing your central heating settings significantly, space heaters are usually just an additional expense.\nBut they can be worth it for quick heat or in rooms where your central heat does not work properly!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/do-space-heaters-save-money/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDo space heaters save you money?

Place candles on a fireproof surface below and light them. Ensure enough air reaches the candles to get the most heat out of your candles.\nLet’s have a look at building your clay pot heater in more detail.\nHow to build a Terracotta Pot Heater First, gather the materials to build your own clay pot heater. You need\nA terracotta clay pot (or any other non-inflammable type of flowerpot) at least 3 candles Bricks or stones to hold the terracotta pot heater up A safe surface to place everything on, such as a stone slab or a plate Most of these materials should already be available around your house. And if not, they are very simple to get. Or you can also use alternative materials.\nFor example, if you don’t have properly sized bricks at home, you can also use stones you find outdoors or wood. Just be careful when setting everything up to minimize the chance that something ignites.\nIn general, clay and stone materials are the best as they are not only not inflammable, but also store a good amount of heat.\nHow to arrange the different pot heater parts First, prepare your safe surface. I use a small stone slab I found in the garden, but you can use a plate as well.\nThen, arrange at least two bricks around the safe surface to hold up the inverted flowerpot. If you use more than two bricks, make sure there’s enough space for air to reach the candles.\nAlso, make sure the bricks are not too tall, otherwise, the heat from the candle disperses and does not reach the flowerpot.\nPlace the candles onto your safe surface. The candles should be only about one or two inches below the flowerpot opening to ensure that the heat accumulates in the flowerpot.\nFlip your flowerpot upside down and place it onto the bricks.\nPlace a few candles below the flowerpot onto the safe surface. Generally, I’d suggest starting with one or two candles. Then, you can see how much heat they produce and add more candles if you need more heat.\nExperimenting is key when building and optimizing your flowerpot heater.\nHow much heat does a flowerpot heater produce? A flowerpot heater produces about 50W per candle when tealights are used. Larger candles yield more power. To heat a small room you need at least 5 candles. That’s the equivalent of an electric space heater on low settings.\nAccording to my candle heating guide and thenakedscientist.com an average candle produces 80W of power.\nYou can calculate this number by considering the heat energy stored in 1 gram of candle wax, which is 37 Kilojoules, and then measuring how much wax a candle burns per second. A candle’s burning rate is about 0.5 milligrams of wax per second.\nMy own flowerpot heating experiment I did my own experiment for the small tealights I used:\nI set up a candle pot heater with 2 tealights as an experiment. Each tealight lasted about 3.5 hours. The small tealights I used in the experiment contain 10 grams of wax each.\nThis means my personal burning rate is 10 grams per 3.5 hours, which equals a burning rate of 0.79 milligrams of wax per second.\nThis means a terracotta pot heater produces heat from burning 0.79 milligrams of wax per second multiplied by 37kJ of energy released per gram = 35.89W of heating power.\nI am honestly surprised that the scientific data and my own experiment’s results differ that much. Interestingly, I found that either the original experiment’s burning rate values (or mine?) must be wrong because my tealight’s burning rate is around 50% higher, but my candle yielded less power.\nThe original experiment’s candle was probably larger.\nThe differences in the burning rate and candle power could result from the structure of the heater. A clay pot radiates a part of the heat back to the candle and melts the wax. Molten wax burns faster than solid wax.\nThe structure of the flowerpot heater determines how much heat it produces. The more optimized the clay pot heater is, the higher the candle wax burning rate is. However, instead of optimizing the structure, adding more candles is much easier and gives you the same results.\nShould you use a clay pot with or without a hole? flowerpots come with and without holes.\nPots without a hole have a higher heat capacity and will hold the heat for longer. However, the candle burning rate, and therefore the heat output of a closed flowerpot is comparatively low, because of limited air supply.\nOn the other hand, flowerpots with a hole allow your candles to burn faster and produce more heat because a stream of air will form through the hole due to the heat rising upward.\nThe hole allows heat to escape quicker. This reduces the overall heating capacity of your flowerpot heater. And due to the increased burning rate, you will have to replace candles more often.\nSo, which one should you use?\nFor maximum heat production, you should use a flowerpot with a hole. For maximum burning duration of the candles, you should use a closed flowerpot.\nHow many candles do I need for my room size? Now that we know how much power a flowerpot heater can produce, let’s have a look at how many candles you need to heat your room.\nAccording to the experiment I performed earlier, an average candle produces 50W of power in a terracotta pot heater.\nThere are different scenarios that determine the number of candles you need:\nin an emergency situation you need only a few candles to heat to comfortable temperatures you need more candles Let’s have a look at the number of candles you need depending on the room’s size in emergency and in comfort situations.\nComfortable temperatureEmergencySmall bedroom (132 square feet)10 candles5 candlesAverage bedroom ( **224 square feet)20 candles10 candlesAverage living room (340 square feet)**30 candles15 candles\nTo calculate these values, I assumed an average candle power of 87W. I assumed that large rooms such as average living rooms require 1500W to stay comfortably warm in winter. That’s about the power an electric space heater produces on high settings.\nAccordingly, an average bedroom needs 1000W and a small bedroom 500W.\nFor emergency situations, I have cut the power requirements and, therefore, the number of candles in half.\nHow to improve clay pot heater safety Clay pot heaters are inherently dangerous. They have exposed hot parts, such as the clay pot itself and open candle flames, which can ignite other things in your room.\nAdditionally, a flowerpot heater is very easy to tip over. None of the parts are fixed and merely balance on top of each other.\nAlso, the candle’s flames consume the oxygen in your room.\nHere’s what you should do to improve your terracotta pot heater’s safety:\nYou can lock the flowerpot heater in an empty bird cage. This ensures that children and pets can not reach it.\nHowever, even in a cage, it is still very susceptible to tipping over. One bump into the cage and everything falls.\nTo make it tip-over-proof secure your pot heater with a few bent metal rails and screws.\nAs long as you don’t have children or pets at home, you don’t have to take these precautions, however.\nMake sure to regularly vent the room as the candle flames slowly consume the oxygen.\nI recommend venting at least every hour. The advantage of flowerpot heaters is that venting does not cool down your room much.\nA lot of the heat is stored in the flowerpot. So, a one-minute venting won’t cool you down too much.\nWhich types of candles should you use for a flowerpot heater? The ideal candle for flowerpot heating lasts a long time, has the right dimensions to put under a flowerpot, and is cheap.\nFirst, let’s look at candle types suitable for flowerpot heating:\nTealights My favorite candle for flowerpot heaters are tealights. They are very inexpensive and the most affordable of all options.\nAdditionally, tealights give off a sufficient amount of power and you can easily place many tealights next to each other.\nTealights come in thin metal cups which improve the safety of the candle and which also ensures that the amount of burned wax is maximized. In contrast, other candles without metal cups go out after some time and a large chunk of wax is left over.\nTealights burn off completely, which ensures that you get the most heat energy for your money.\nPillar candles Pillar candles are, as their name suggests, very wide, solid and they have a thick wick. Pillar candles are usually cheap to get (if you buy them in the right stores). Avoid buying them in fashion or decor stores.\nRather, look for them in cheap hardware stores. Pillar candles do not come with a cup. This is a disadvantage because you won’t be able to burn 100% of the wax.\nStill, pillar candles shine with a high wax burning rate due to their thick wich and longevity due to the large amount of wax.\nPillar candles are suitable for overnight flowerpot heating because they last a long time.\nDo not use these candles:\nDecorative candles With decorative candles I refer to these long, thin candles you place on your table for dinner. They are decorative because they are not made for heating, but for decoration.\nIf you light one, it burns off quickly because of its thin shape. However, their dimensions are not suitable for flowerpot heaters. Also, they are relatively expensive.\nScented candles Scented candles are another example of candle you should not use for your terracotta pot heater. Usually, they come in a cup, which is a good thing. And they have a large diameter, due to which they last a long time.\nHowever, scented candles are luxury products. For heating, we want to get the most heat energy for the least amount of money. Scented candles are too expensive for flowerpot heaters.\nBut if you have one lying around and you don’t use it, then feel free to heat with it. But never but scented candles for heating!\nWhich type of pot should I use? There are different types of flowerpots that you can use. The ideal pot type supports your heater’s safety, heat distribution and does not break down when exposed to heat.\nClay pots Clay pots and terracotta pots are the most suitable pot type to build a candle pot heater with. They are both affordable and safe. If one breaks, they are cheap to replace.\nAnd they have a large heat capacity, which means they will hold the heat for a long time, even after the candles go out or when you vent your room.\nCeramic pots Ceramic pots are very similar to clay and terracotta pots. They are safe and have a good heat capacity.\nThey are glazed and colorful and usually more elaborately crafted, which makes them more expensive to get.\nIf you have a ceramic flowerpot at home, you can use it for your heater, but I would not recommend buying a new one just to build your candle pot heater.\nConcrete pots Concrete pots are cheap to get in hardware stores. Concrete pots are, however, usually very heavy and oversized for flowerpot heaters.\nMetal pots Metal flowerpots are not suited for building a flowerpot heater. The thin metal sucks the heat away very quickly and will cool down quickly as well due to its low heat capacity.\nAlso, metal pots rust very quickly when they heat up. They are not durable at all.\nWhich terracotta pot heater types are there? Let’s have a look at different candle pot heaters.\nStandard clay pot heater The standard clay pot heater consists of an inverted clay pot below which burning candles are placed.\nThe standard clay pot heater is simple to set up and low-cost. It is, however, unsafe to use and does not distribute and store the heat too well. It’s similar to having a hot stone in your room.\nNested pot heater The nested pot heater is a variant of the standard pot heater where multiple clay pots of different sizes are stacked on top of each other. Between each pot pair, a layer of air acts as insulation.\nThe advantage of this type of heater is that it is safe to touch since the outer pot does not heat up much. Also, the total heat capacity of a nested pot heater is higher, since the total mass of the heater also increases.\nThis means this heater is better suited when kids or pets are around, and it will retain heat for longer when you vent your room.\nHowever, the structure of the heater does not change anything about the heating efficiency, since efficiency only depends on the type of candle used.\nAlso, nested pot heaters are harder to set up.\nEngineered pot heater An engineered pot heater is a type of flowerpot heater that involves lots of technical design. Here’s an example:\n\u0026amp;ab_channel=desertsun02\nEngineered pot heaters like this one look very promising. And they have a few advantages, such as directed heat flow, larger heat output due to a ventilation system, and improved safety.\nHowever, the efficiency of the candles can not be changed by the heater’s structure. It’s a fixed physical constant. So, heaters like this can only maximize the power of the candles by increasing the burning rate.\nA higher burning rate, however, means that you have to replace candles more frequently.\nInstead of spending your time engineering a flowerpot heater, you should rather build a wood stove or improve the insulation of your home. These yield much greater results!\nWhen to use clay pot heaters? Building and using a clay pot heater only makes sense in an emergency situation where you have no access to heat. For example, when there’s an energy outage, you don’t have any heating devices, or when you are in an off-grid cabin.\nIt could also make sense in a workshop or garage.\nBut honestly, I do not recommend relying on clay pot heaters.\nFirst, you need a lot of candles. Candles cost money. And usually, they cost more per Kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy than oil, gas, or electricity.\nTo heat a small room using candles for a day, you’ll need a supply of approximately 40 candles. And the worst is: When you need them in an emergency, or due to rising energy prices, they are always out of stock.\nI am right now looking for candles online, and I can’t find a single reasonably priced offer.\nUsing candles for heating is unreliable. There’s a reason we primarily use oil, gas, electricity, or wood for heating.\nAnd in emergencies, it is much wiser to have a pile of good old wood at home rather than hundreds of small tealights.\nWhat are the alternatives to clay pot heaters? Using a clay pot heater rarely makes sense. Better alternatives for emergency heating are wood stoves or propane heaters.\nInstall your own wood stove Wood stoves are very flexible. They are a great long-term investment. You install one once and having it will pay off for a long time, especially if you can chop your own wood.\nIn emergencies, it’s always a lot easier to find wood in the forests as compared to searching for out-of-stock candles.\nYou can store wood for many years.\nUse a propane heater Another alternative to candle heating in emergencies is propane heaters. I always recommend getting this propane heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nYou can hook up two propane bottles and it lasts for hours, or even days! Also, you can release a lot more heat than using candles and you can control how much the heater should heat.\nAnd on top of that, propane gas is very affordable and you can store a big propane tank bottle in your garden for emergencies that will supply you and your family with heat for weeks or even months!\nOil lamps Petroleum lamps still exist! You probably know them from movies. You can get them in flea markets or garage sales. Maybe you can also find one online.\nThe advantage of petroleum oil lamps is that petroleum is easy to store and the flame of an oil lamp is big enough to equal the size of half a dozen candles combined.\nNevertheless, this is just an idea I wanted to list. And honestly, I still prefer wood or propane!\nConclusion As you see, using propane heaters or wood stoves is a lot more scalable and reasonable to use in an emergency.\nCandles are always out of stock in emergency situations, so you should not rely on terracotta clay pot heaters as a primary heat source.\nNevertheless, when you have no other options, it makes sense to build a simple clay pot heater.\nYou don’t have to over-engineer your heater. A simple set of candles combined with an inverted pot and something that hold up the pot is enough!\nBuilding a fancy nested or engineered clay pot heater does not improve efficiency! It only changes the candle burning rate of your clay pot heater and you will have to replace candles more often.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-build-a-terracotta-clay-pot-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is the ultimate guide on how to make a terracotta clay pot heater to reduce your heating expenses in the cold season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUtility and electricity bills are at an all-time high currently and I have been looking for ways to save some money while still keeping my expenses low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we’re going to check everything you need to know about terracotta clay pot heaters, how to build them, which materials are best and how to set them up safely.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"How to Build a Terracotta Clay Pot Heater"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s frustrating to repeatedly turn your portable air conditioners on and off, and you might want to keep them on forever. The question now is whether it is even safe to run them 24/7. Here\u0026rsquo;s the answer:\nQuick Answer: Yes, portable air conditioners can run 24/7. While it may not have a negative impact on the AC itself, it will result in an increase of your electricity bill by around $151.20 a month. If you really need to run your portable AC that much, you should rather get a wall-mounted AC unit.\nRunning your portable AC unit 24/7 is not always the most energy-efficient option.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get right to the finer details of using a portable air conditioner continuously.\nWhat Happens if You Run a Portable Air Conditioner 24/7? High power usage and electricity cost Because portable air conditioners require a lot of power, operating one constantly will increase your electricity bill.\nIf you’re using a portable air conditioner and your power bill spikes, you may be operating your unit too much. Using a portable air conditioner all day long will use up a lot of power, which can result in a higher electric bill.\nIf you’re noticing your power bill going up, try using your portable air conditioner less often or for shorter periods of time.\nAccording to the portable AC running cost guide, the cost of running a portable air conditioner for a month is $5.04 every 24 hours. Which, if you do the calculation, sums up to $151.20 for a month.\nNoise Because they are different from central air conditioners, portable air conditioners also create noise, which can be irritating and frustrating if left on all day.\nHowever, if the noise is loud or odd, it may indicate that a component is damaged or not performing properly.\nMold growth and smell Since dust and water droplets build up on the ac evaporator coil over time, it eventually decomposes or even provides a place for bacteria and fungi to thrive, which causes the portable air conditioner to smell.\nThe water tank itself should be fine since only distilled water from the air and no dust reaches it.\nIncreased need for AC Maintenance It becomes very important to maintain the portable air conditioner when you run it 24/7. Since it gathers a lot of moisture, especially in humid areas, you must drain its water tank properly. Running it continuously means you should be up for draining it every day too.\nAdditionally, continued use will clog and dirty the air filters and the evaporator coil, necessitating frequent filter cleaning. The clogged filth in them is another incentive to clean them.\nWhy Is It Necessary to Drain the Portable Air Conditioner? It is important to drain your portable air conditioner since it releases water that could lead to overflowing if you don\u0026rsquo;t drain it. Additionally, the microbes can start to grow in the water and make you sick.\nMost portable air conditioners have a built-in float switch that automatically turns off when the water tank fills. Hence if you don’t drain the water tank of your ac, the unit will turn off.\nSafety Risks of Running a Portable AC Continuously Dehydration Since the air conditioners dry out the air, it substantially contributes to dehydration and even causes a sore throat due to dry and cool air. Dehydration can subsequently lead to a wide range of other issues.\nMaintaining moisture in the air is essential, and you can use a humidifier. It will replenish the moisture in the air, thus preventing dehydration.\nAsthma Running a portable air conditioner 24/7 causes the air filters to get dirty and spreads allergens in the air. Even moisture that builds up inside the appliance can encourage mold growth, and the germs can spread through the airflow. This air may potentially trigger allergic reactions or an asthma attack.\nHeadaches This is a factor that can be caused due to dehydration. When the fluid level in your body is low, the brain starts to contract as a consequence that can cause headaches.\nAlso read: Are Portable Air Conditioners Safe?\nHow to Setup Your Portable AC for 24/7 Usage? To run your portable AC 24/7 do these things:\nDrain the water tank regularly Place the portable ac on an anti-vibration pad to reduce noise Set the AC to its lowest settings to reduce wear and increase your AC\u0026rsquo;s durability Insulate the portable air conditioner\u0026rsquo;s hose to increase energy efficiency I recommend getting these anti-vibration pads (click here to view them on amazon), which reduce noise and prevent walking and shaking of your portable air conditioner.\nInsulating the hose and window kit with aluminum wrap and HVAC tape is a great idea because it reduces cooling cycles and improves efficiency.\nIs Running a Portable AC 24/7 a Good Idea? No doubt, a portable air conditioner can be run 24/7. However, it is better that you don’t run it for that long. The reason why it\u0026rsquo;s not a good idea to run it for this long is because they are not very efficient. Instead, you can opt for a wall unit AC.\nA wall unit AC in comparison takes up less space, is more efficient, and will even save you money in the long run. On the other hand, a portable AC is good if you plan to run it for 4-8 hours a day.\nAbove all, running a portable AC is not a good idea because it has a harmful effect on the environment due to its low efficiency.\nYou can estimate a regular portable air conditioner to consume only half of the power of a portable air conditioner while producing the same cooling effect.\nHow Can You Extend the Life of Your Portable Air Conditioner? Clean Regularly It goes without saying that the first thing you need to check is whether or not the air conditioner is clean. The air conditioner\u0026rsquo;s efficiency is decreased when filters clog up with dust or accumulation.\nSo, especially when running your portable air conditioner continuously, you have to maintain it regularly.\nNot only the performance, but it can even cause overheating and total damage.\nPlace Your Air Conditioner Properly Make sure to place your air conditioner near a power outlet and window for ventilation and drainage purposes. It is a fact that an air conditioner’s ability to operate effectively depends on where it is placed.\nUse Less Electrical Appliances When there are too many electrical appliances running in the same space, the air conditioner will struggle to run properly because of the heat emanating from other appliances.\nConclusion You can run your portable air conditioner 24/7, but it rarely makes sense. If you really need to cool your room so much, it makes a lot more sense to get an actual wall-mounted AC unit.\nThe reduced energy consumption of a regular AC will make up for the increased installation cost.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-portable-air-conditioners-run-continuously/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s frustrating to repeatedly turn your \u003ca href=\"/how-does-a-portable-air-conditioner-work/\"\u003eportable air conditioners\u003c/a\u003e on and off, and you might want to keep them on forever.

Dyson is known for their high-quality, technologically advanced cooling fans, among other household items. But are they really worth that hefty price?\nQuick answer: No, Dyson cooling fans are not worth it and overpriced. For venting a room, a regular floor or pedestal fan will perform just as well. However, Dyson cooling fans can be worth it in some situations for their directional, strong airflow and their design.\nThis does not mean you should never get a Dyson cooling fan. Let’s have a closer look at what I mean and in which cases Dyson fans excel.\nIn this article, we are going to check this Dyson cooling fan (click here to view it on amazon).\nDifference between Dyson and Regular Fans Dyson cooling fans do the same job regular fans do. The only difference is design and Dyson’s marketing claims.\nBoth regular and Dyson fans blow air around your room so it feels cooler than it actually is. They reduce the “ perceived temperature”.\nSo why would you buy a $400 Dyson fan to do something a regular $50 fan can do as well?\nI am not trying to sell you anything. So, I am going to check Dyson’s marketing claims unbiasedly. Here are my findings:\nDyson fan design To start with, Dyson fans have an inconspicuous elegance unique among fans.\nThanks to its bladeless design, the fan is compact and good-looking.\nAlso, there are no spinning blades, which is\nvery nice to look at (no movement in your room) a safety feature (pets or children can’t cut themselves) Guests who have never seen a Dyson fan before likely don’t even note there’s a fan in the room because it blends well into home décor and works silently behind the scenes.\nBut I guess there are a few people who don’t recognize Dyson’s design. Anyways, it looks good, hides spinning blades, and blends with your room.\nNoise levels: Are Dyson fans silent? No, Dyson fans are only silent on the absolute lowest settings, where they don’t move much air. On moderate to high settings Dyson fans are as loud as a hairdryer.\nSpeaking of silence, Dyson claims their fans are 70% quieter than the best-selling regular fans. They even claim that a Dyson fan is silent at low speed.\nIn truth, however, this is only a marketing claim with no solid foundation. Here’s a video that shows you that Dyson fans are loud:\n\u0026amp;ab_channel=Unsharpen\nPeople even complain about Dyson fan noise. Here’s a quote:\nThe fan is very quiet on 1. Hahahaha. I have a Dyson fan. It’s fan power is so weak I almost always have it on at 10. At 10 it’s so noisy it feels like I’m about to board the plane.\nLewis Lau in a YouTube comment\nAnd I agree with that.\nAre Dyson fans more energy efficient? Here’s what Dyson claims:\nThe design of a Dyson fan also makes it very energy efficient, using 40% less energy than regular fans. High-performance Dyson fans have a power rating of 26 watts compared to at least 50 watts found on regular fans.\nThe truth is:\nFans are very simple devices. Efficiency is only lost due to friction at the rotational axis of the fan blades.\nAny decently built fan with decent bearings will have low friction which is indistinguishable from Dyson.\nDyson does not have a special bearing system that reduces friction and therefore has the same efficiency as any other fan.\nHigh Quality and Durability Dyson fans have a two-year warranty for a reason. The company is so confident about their product quality that they don\u0026rsquo;t doubt your fan will still be okay after two years.\nAccording to Dyson, the cooling fans utilize liquid crystal polymer instead of plastic. I honestly don’t know what the difference is. And I don’t think the exact material used makes any significant difference in efficiency or durability.\nMaybe there is a difference, but I bet it’s not enough to be more durable than a good old full-metal floor fan. Nothing beats metal. Not even a fancy “liquid crystal polymer” material.\nOne thing I have to admit:\nDyson cooling fans are also easy to clean and maintain thanks to the bladeless design. you simply need to wipe the frame clean occasionally.\nRegular fans, on the other hand, are very hard to clean, since you have to open the fan cage which is tightened using several screws. So, you oftentimes skip cleaning classic fans.\nAir filtering Most Dyson cooling fans have air purification technology (which is Dyson’s term for “air filtering”) to eliminate smells and allergens from your air.\nYes, Dyson’s air filtering is an advantage compared to regular fans. However, in the long run, the filters have to be dusted and maintained.\nHigher-end Dyson fans also come with a built-in heater or a dehumidifier to use when needed. You will use such a fan when it\u0026rsquo;s hot to cool the air around you and use it during winter to warm your room.\nThe heating will, however, increase your electricity bill by about $25 a month.\nCheck out this article: Are Dyson Heaters energy-efficient? (Running Cost Check)\nAir multiplier technology But where Dyson cooling fans shine most over the rest is in their use of technology and old-school science to make a fan that\u0026rsquo;s beautiful, quiet, energy efficient, and better at cooling you. These design cooling fans are equipped with air multiplier technology, which increases the velocity of the airflow.\nDyson fans also utilize technology to allow you to use remote control, voice command, or an app to control the ten speed and temperature settings.\nIs Air Multiplier Technology a marketing hoax? While Dyson markets their cooling fans as bladeless, they actually do have blades hidden and aligned asymmetrically inside the casing.\nOnce you turn on the fan, a brushless motor rotates these blades and sucks in as much as 5 gallons of air on the highest settings.\nThe collected air is then passed upwards towards a hollow tube at the top of the fan and then directed towards the front of the device and pushed out through thin slits.\nBecause there\u0026rsquo;s less space for air to pass through, it moves faster according to Bernoulli’s principle.\nBut here is a misunderstanding most people have:\nThe air indeed moves faster in total, but the volume of moving air per second stays constant since due to the slits, the fan blows now a thinner layer of air.\nOverall, air multiplier technology has no effect on cooling. It does not increase the total airflow rate when compared to a regular fan that consumes the same power.\nAccording to Dyson, the air multiplier technology multiplies this air, so it pushes 15 times more air through the slits. The combination of faster-moving air and more volume is what makes Dyson cooling fans so effective and efficient.\nThis is likely a plain wrong statement from a physics standpoint.\nDyson fans have a very directional airflow Dyson fans have one advantage due to their design. The air stream leaving the fan slits is very directional, smooth, and narrow.\nThis makes Dyson fans well-suited for cooling people, instead of venting rooms. Just point your Dyson fan at people in your home to reduce their perceived temperature.\nBut because the air is very smooth and stable, it might be more comfortable to run 24/7 than a regular fan.\nLike standing pedestal fans, Dyson fans have side-to-side oscillation, so you can have the fan cooling a few people sitting around a small living room or a couch.\nThe movement of the fan head can be controlled with a remote.\nConclusion Are Dyson cooling fans worth it? I would honestly say: No, Dyson fans are not worth it. Dyson fans look great and are solid fans. However, in a technical comparison, they perform no better than any regular fan.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-dyson-cooling-fans-worth-it/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre Dyson cooling fans worth it?

In this article, we\u0026rsquo;re going to check how much electric power solar panels produce and how you can use this power to heat your home. We’re going to consider the effects of different seasons of the year on your solar power generation and the power yields of different roof sizes!\nQuick answer: Yes, solar panels can heat a house. To heat your home on solar panels only, you will need to install 19 solar panels to power electric heating, or 7 solar panels to power a heat pump with a coefficient of performance (CoP) of 3.\nHow much power do solar panels produce? Average solar panels produce between 250 - 400 Watts of power. The higher the Wattage a solar panel can produce, the more premium it is and the more expensive it is. Usually, solar panels are priced in dollars per watt.\nHigher wattage is always preferable.\nOf course, the wattage rating of solar panels is measured under ideal conditions in laboratories. In reality, the wattage heavily depends on the weather, the orientation of the roof, time of day, and sun intensity.\nAn average solar panel in the US produces about 1.8kWh a day. That is the amount of energy to run a 1800W device for one hour. At an average electricity rate of 14 cents per kWh, one solar panel reduces your electricity cost by 28 cents.\nHow many solar panels can a roof fit? The US-average roof size is 1,700 square feet (about 160m2). An average solar panel is 17,6 square feet. Theoretically, an average roof could fit 101 solar panels.\nIf you know your roof’s area, just divide it by the average solar panel size to get the theoretical maximum amount of solar panels you can install.\nOf course, there are practical limitations to this. Due to the geometry specific to your roof, you can only cover parts of your roof. And usually, you cover only the one side of your roof that yields the most electric power.\nThe realistic maximum amount of solar panels a home can fit is between 30 and 40. However, even that is more than you need!\nMost homes install 20 to 24 solar panels rated 340W, which is enough to cover 100% of their energy usage.\nCan I heat my house using solar panels? To heat your home using solar panels, your solar panels have to absorb enough power from the sun. Let’s check how much energy, solar panels produce in the winter.\nHow much power do solar panels produce in the winter?\nHowever, usually, you want to heat in the wintertime, where there are fewer sun hours and the sun rays have a lower inclination compared to summer.\nHowever, there is an interesting, counterintuitive effect: In the cold, solar panels gain efficiency. The cold air reduces internal electric resistances.\nAccording to an experiment by “The Solar Nerd” located in Buffalo:\nOn an average winter day, one solar panel produces around 0.25kWh of energy. On a sunny winter day, average solar panels can produce up to 1kWh of energy. And on a day where your roof is covered in snow, the power production is close to zero.\nThis looks like pretty bad values. However, this is where net metering gets beneficial. If you feed in your energy into your city’s electric grid, the excess energy you produce in summer makes up for the lack of energy in winter.\n“If you have net metering, it means that the excess electricity you generate in the summer will be banked as credits that you can “spend” in the winter.”\nthesolarnerd.com\nSo, it does not really matter whether your solar panels produce less in winter and more in summer, which is initially a concern for most people. Just make sure that net metering is supported in your area.\nHow much power do you need to heat a house? An average home needs about 12,000kWh of heat energy a year ( source). A heat pump with a coefficient of performance (CoP) would need 4,000kWh of energy a year, while other regular heating systems would require the full 12,000kWh.\nSo, you already see that the heating system you use matters.\nAlso, the way you heat matters. Do you heat the full house? Or do you need to heat just one room in a blackout emergency situation?\nTo heat one medium-sized room to a comfortable temperature in winter, you will need around 750W of power. That’s the equivalent heat output of a regular space heater on moderate settings. In 24h that’s 750W x 24h = 18kWh a day. To heat during the cold half of the year, you would need 6 months x 30 days x 18kWh = 3,240kWh.\nWith a heat pump with a CoP of 3 that would be only about 1,080kWh.\nTo heat a whole house, you need 12,000kWh of energy per year or 4,000kWh with a heat pump. To heat a single room, you need 3,240kWh of energy per year or 1,080kWh with a heat pump.\nHow many solar panels do you need for heating? Here’s how many solar panels you need to cover just the heating of your home considering an average production rate of 1.8kWh per solar panel per day.\nElectric HeatingHeat PumpWhole house19 Solar Panels7 Solar PanelsSingle Room5 Solar Panels2 Solar Panels\nThe formula used in the table is (yearly energy / 1.8kWh * 365). Feel free to plug your own yearly heating energy consumption into the formula to calculate your personal required amount of solar panels. You should be able to find your annual energy consumption on your heating bill.\nFinding:\nYes, you can heat a house on solar panels. You need 19 solar panels to heat a house using electric heating, or 7 solar panels to heat a house using a heat pump.\nTo heat a single room, you need 5 solar panels using electric heating and 2 when using a heat pump.\nHowever, keep in mind that these numbers are just to cover heating. To run your entire house’s electric grid on solar panels, you will need to install at least 20 more solar panels.\nSo, to make an entire home fully energy independent including the heating, you need 39 solar panels with classic electric heating or 27 solar panels when you have a heat pump.\nNow that we know how many solar panels you need to heat a house, let’s have a look at how you can do it.\nHow can you convert solar panel power to heat? If you feed your solar panel power back into your neighborhood’s electric grid and you make use of net metering, you don’t have to worry about setting up complex heating systems.\nThe net metering ensures that you can heat independently of your solar panel’s current power output.\nTo heat your house using solar panel power, you can only use electric heating methods. Two different methods pop out.\nElectric space heaters The simplest way to heat your home using the electricity of your solar panels is electric resistance heating.\nThis could be either a central heating unit in your home that is already electricity-based, or you can buy simple space heaters to keep your home warm.\nTo mimic the look and feel of classic radiators, I recommend electric oil-filled radiators.\nIf you want to be very efficient, you can use infrared space heaters. These radiate infrared heat waves directionally. You can always point them towards you. Instead of heating the entire room, you heat just yourself.\nGenerally, in a family home, I recommend using oil-filled radiators, because they are able to produce a comfortable warmth.\nThere are other types of space heaters such as ceramic space heaters, but for heating entire homes, I recommend either infrared or oil-filled.\nElectric space heaters are rated at 1,500W. One space heater alone will consume 13,140kWh of energy a year, which is more than the 12,000kWh an average home needs for heating.\nThe formula is 1.5kW x 24h a day x 365 days a year = 13,140kWh\n(yes, I know, you probably won’t run your space heater 24/7 for the whole year, but you get the point. And you can tweak the numbers!)\nThis means that an average 1500W electric space heater produces a lot more heat than you need. To realistically heat a house, I recommend getting 3 electric space heaters and running them on moderate settings. Place each space heater in a different room to cover your entire home.\nThis reduces the wattage of each space heater and improves safety while still providing the same amount of heat.\nCheck this article to see my recommended oil-filled radiator: The Best Oil-Filled Radiator\nAir source and ground source heat pumps With heat pumps, you can use your solar panel’s power to heat your house. Heat pumps work just like the reverse of a fridge or an air conditioner. They extract heat energy from the air outside or the ground and pump it into the house.\nHeat pumps work even if it’s colder outside than inside! And they move more heat energy than the amount of electric energy you put into it.\nThis makes heat pumps one of the very few appliances with efficiencies bigger than 100%.\nThe downside of heat pumps is that their cost of installation is $4000-$8000, which is very high and pays for itself only after many years.\nIf you just got solar panels, the expense might be too high.\nBut remember that installing a heat pump also increases the worth of your home. So, the money is not really lost.\nEnergy storage without net metering Heating your house on solar panels is reliably possible due to net metering. The surplus of energy produced in the summer makes up for the lack of energy produced in the winter.\nNet metering acts as a virtual storage of your electric energy. You feed energy into the electric grid and you can withdraw it anytime.\nIf your area does not support net metering, for example when you are in a remote place or you are living in a mobile home not connected to an electric grid, heating in the wintertime using solar panels only is barely possible.\nWithout net metering, with an average solar panel’s daily energy production of 0.25kWh during winter, you need either a lot of solar panels to produce sufficient energy, or a supplementary heat source, such as a wood stove.\nAnother option is to install energy storage batteries to store surplus energy from the summer. However, they are very expensive, inefficient, and have too little capacity for heating.\nDoes it make sense to heat a house using solar energy? Whether it makes sense to heat your home using solar panels depends on your situation. Solar panels are expensive to install and they deteriorate over time.\nIf you don’t have net metering heating with solar panels is never realistically feasible.\nIf your area has net metering, yes, heating your house using solar energy can be worth it. Especially with a heat pump.\nThe alternatives oil, gas, or wood can be, however, more reliable, easier to access, and require almost no maintenance.\nThe answer is very difficult. I’d say the following:\nHeat pump and net metering: Solar panel heating is worth it. Electric heating and net metering: Solar panel heating is worth it, but there’s potential for improvement. You need to install a dozen more solar panels when compared to using heat pumps. Make sure your home is well-insulated to improve heating efficiency. No net metering: With an average home and average amount of solar panels, you can not realistically cover the energy consumption for heating during wintertime. Especially in unstable, cold, and cloudy weather where you need the most heating, solar panels generate the least energy.\nStick to other energy sources such as wood, oil, or gas. This article will help you: The 21 Cheapest Methods to Heat a Room \u0026amp; House Conclusion Yes, solar panels can heat a house. But you can not realistically heat independently of your neighborhood’s electric grid.\nElectric and heat pump heating off solar panel energy is only possible with net metering where your area’s electric provider guarantees the storage of your surplus energy generated in the summer.\nIf you want to generate heat independently, you need to stick to classic energy sources such as wood, oil, or gas.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-solar-panels-heat-a-house/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan solar panels heat a house?

In this article, we’re checking 5 possible reasons and how to fix them!\nQuick answer: Your portable air conditioner collects no water because it is either broken or the water tank leaks. Low air humidity is also a potential cause. Another cause is that your portable AC is an evaporative cooler, which does not collect water.\nLet’s have a look at each of those reasons.\nYour portable air conditioner is broken If your portable air conditioner is broken, and it does not cool, it won’t collect any water in its water tank. Checking this issue is very easy. Fixing it is a little harder. Here’s how.\nHow to check: Check if your portable air conditioner produces cold air by turning it on and holding your hand where the cold air is supposed to come out. If after 1 minute, the air leaving the air conditioner is still warm, that means your portable air conditioner is broken. If you can’t tell for sure, then pay attention to the noise your portable AC makes. Occasionally, there should be a compressor noise. If your portable AC makes no noise aside from the fan blowing sound, it is likely broken.\nHow to fix: Let’s first eliminate the most obvious reason for your portable air conditioner not cooling and not making any compressing noise. On the thermostat, check that the target temperature is set lower than the current room temperature. If the set target temperature is too warm, your portable is of course not collecting water because it does not attempt to cool.\nIf still, no cold air comes out of your portable air conditioner, it is likely broken.\nIn case your portable air conditioner is broken, continue with this portable air conditioner repair guide .\nThe air in your room has low humidity Another possible cause for your portable air conditioner not working is low air humidity. If the air in your room holds no humidity, your portable AC can not collect any water.\nOf course, there is no room that contains no humidity. Especially because we humans consist of 60% water. So, as soon as someone is present in a room, the person’s breath will cause the portable AC to absorb water.\nDepending on how dry it is in your area, the rate of water collection could be very slow.\nHow to check: Check if your portable air conditioner blows cold air. If it does, everything is fine. To check for low humidity in your room place a hot can of water in the middle of the room. The water vapor should cause the portable AC to absorb more water.\nHow to fix: There is no need to fix this! Humidity reduces the efficiency of a portable air conditioner. Having low humidity in a room is a good thing!\nYou bought a fake air conditioner Another possible reason for your portable air conditioner not cooling is that you bought a fake AC.\nOnline, you can find tons of portable air conditioners that are not real air conditioning systems.\nA real air conditioner consists of a ducting system, an evaporator coil, a compressor, and an exhaust hose. If at least one of those is missing, your portable AC won’t work.\nThese products are often made cheaply and sold on online marketplaces such as amazon.\nIf your portable air conditioner has no hose attached, that’s an immediate red flag that your portable air conditioner is not a real AC that collects water.\nThese “fake” portable air conditioners are often sold as “air coolers” or “evaporative coolers”.\nHow to check: Check your portable air conditioner. It should have an exhaust hose, a big size, heavy weight. and it should make noise when it’s running. There are no ventless, silent, or lightweight portable air conditioners that really work.\nHow to fix: Get a real portable air conditioner, if you fell for a scam product. Ventless portable air conditioners never work.\nYour portable air conditioner’s water tank leaks Another reason your portable air conditioner does not collect water is that the water tank leaks.\nIf your portable AC’s water tank has a leak, it’s impossible to ever fill up and collect water. Also, in the high summer heat, you won’t notice the water leaking, because it will evaporate quickly.\nEspecially if your portable AC stands on a carpet, the water is absorbed and invisible to you.\nThe water absorbed by air conditioners comes straight from the air in your room. Because gaseous water can hold no minerals, the absorbed water is distilled. This means it will leave no stains on your carpet or on the floor when it leaks.\nHow to check: Run your portable air conditioner and check the floor below it after a few minutes. The leaking water tank leaves a small pit of water below the AC. Also, you can unmount the water tank (if possible) and check for any visible leaks.\nHow to fix: Seal the water tank with glue. I recommend getting a waterproof plastic glue such as this JB Weld epoxy (click here to view it on amazon).\nThe slope of the water tank is incorrect It might be that the water tank inside your portable AC is tilted. Your portable AC could still collect water, but, depending on where the drain sits, no water is able to flow out.\nHow to check: Check that your water tank sits properly in the portable AC’s case. It could be that you uninstalled it once and then you misplaced it when you installed it again.\nHow to fix: If the water tank is tilted, double-check how it’s installed. There is likely something wrong with the placement.\nConclusion If your portable air conditioner collects no water but blows cold air, there is no reason to worry. Either it’s a low-humidity room, or your water tank is broken.\nIf your room has low humidity, you don’t need to take any action.\nIf your water tank leaks, it’s usually simple to seal with the right glue.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/portable-air-conditioner-collects-no-water/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhy does your portable air conditioner collect no water?

But before you buy one, it\u0026rsquo;s important to ensure it is safe.\nQuick Answer: Yes, portable air conditioners are safe. As long as you maintain them properly and run them on moderate settings, there are no health hazards. They are also safe for children and pets since there are no exposed hot parts and no sharp edges.\nYou can place the portable air conditioner unit anywhere as long as it removes warm air and blows cool air into your home.\nYou will find answers to your questions and tips on how to run your portable air conditioner safely in this article.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s dig a little deeper into the details.\nDo Portable Air Conditioners Make You Sick? Although portable AC units cannot directly cause you to become sick, they can undoubtedly be a source of sickness. The toxins are readily spread when the air in your room is circulated by air conditioning, leading to health issues.\nPortable ACs have these components:\nEvaporator coil Refrigerant Condenser coil Compressor Fan These components can serve as a breeding ground for bacteria, which they then release into the air and cause you to become ill.\nAmong the illnesses you could experience; nausea, dizziness, headache, earache, cough, allergies, asthma, etc.\nHowever, if you properly care for your portable AC unit, it should not cause you any illnesses. I’ll discuss how you can safely use portable air conditioners later in this blog post.\nDo Portable Air Conditioners Emit Gasses? Portable air conditioners do not release gasses until they tip over and break. Even then, you won\u0026rsquo;t suffer any harm from the gasses released. The carbon chemicals in portable ACs are hydrofluorocarbons, which pose no health hazards.\nMany people falsely assume that portable air conditioners release dangerous carbon monoxide. I\u0026rsquo;ll set the record straight: the air conditioners do not release carbon monoxide.\nYou shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be concerned about having an electricity-powered portable unit because carbon monoxide is formed when fuel is consumed.\nHowever, there is no guarantee of safety if you have a gas-powered air conditioner because the unit could malfunction and release carbon monoxide under certain conditions.\nIf there is a source of carbon monoxide nearby, an air conditioner may also be able to absorb it through its cooling effect.\nAre Portable Air Conditioners Safe for Kids? Yes, a portable air conditioner is quite safe for kids. It does not have any sharp edges or exposed hot parts. Even though some components may heat up when the compressor runs, such components are well-protected.\nOne possible risk for safety is if it tips over, but since it is so heavy, it is nearly impossible for a kid to do so. When children are physically strong enough to tip it over, they are also clever enough to refrain from doing so.\nAre Portable Air Conditioners Safe for Pets? Since portable air conditioners don\u0026rsquo;t feature any harmful components, they are generally safe for use around pets. The air conditioner is actually beneficial for your pets, but if you don\u0026rsquo;t set the temperature just right, it may make them sick.\nYou might even worry that if your cat perched on top of the portable air conditioner, it might get hurt. However, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t worry because, in this situation, a portable air conditioner is perfectly safe.\nSince high humidity can make your pets sick, an air conditioning system is helpful for pet owners. However, be careful not to set the air conditioner’s temperature too low. You need to get the temperature just right to be set to go.\nIs It Safe to Use a Portable Air Conditioner in a Room Without Windows? Yes! Using a portable air conditioner without a window is safe, but the hot air it emits will stay in the space and cause a cycle of cool and hot air, defeating the air conditioner\u0026rsquo;s intended purpose of cooling the space.\nA portable air conditioner must vent hot air somewhere outside, which would be difficult without a window, but not impossible. You could come up with other alternatives to let the heat out.\nYou may vent the heat out through a door, a hole in the wall, or even through the ceiling.\nAlso read: Can You Use a Window Air Conditioner without a Window?\nCan a Portable Air Conditioner Be Left on All Night? You can safely leave a portable air conditioner running all night as long as you run it on moderate settings. On too high cooling settings, it might draw too much power for your wall outlet and overheat.\nThe air conditioner typically turns off by itself when the water tray inside is close to overflowing.\nIf the portable air conditioner overheats throughout the night or if it is not connected to a particular plug, sparks and shorts can occur. Wires that are old and broken may also be to blame.\nAlso, keep in mind that leaving it open all night will result in very high energy consumption and, consequently, high bills.\n4 Tips to Use Portable Air Conditioners Safely Avoid Heat If you set your portable air conditioner in direct sunlight, the heat it radiates will cause it to heat up, making it ineffective at cooling the room and shortening its lifespan due to the extra efforts it will have to make.\nHave Proper Ventilation Proper ventilation will assist channel hot air away from the compressor, preventing it from overheating and effectively cooling the space.\nClean the Air Conditioner Regularly cleaning the portable air conditioner may prevent the ventilation hose from twisting, which could lead to more problems with the unit.\nSimply dampen a towel with only warm water and wipe the conditioner\u0026rsquo;s exterior and vents to clean them. But watch out that the towel isn\u0026rsquo;t dripping.\nReplace the Air Filter It is important to replace the air filters on a regular basis to keep dirt and debris from accumulating inside.\nThe lifespan and effectiveness of the cooling system are both shortened by the dirty air filter, which also reduces air quality by circulating more dust.\nRead more: How to Make a Portable Air Conditioner More Efficient?\nConclusion When it comes to portable air conditioners, they are the safest and most beneficial to have.

In this article, you will learn 3 methods to set up your window AC when you only have a room without regular windows at hand, through a regular or a sliding door.\nWindow units are designed specifically to be mounted on a window. The warm air and water produced during the cooling process escape to the outdoors through the window. But if you don’t have a suitable window in that room, you can improvise another way to remove those by-products without a window.\nQuick answer: Yes, you can use a window air conditioner without a window. You have to build a venting system to lead heat out of the room through a regular or sliding door. Ensure you properly insulate the vent setup to improve efficiency.\nHow Can You Use a Window AC without a Window? Installing a window AC in a windowless room is possible with some creativity. The modifications can be tricky and hard, but they are doable if you are handy.\nLead Heat to another Room A window AC has two components - one part stays inside the house to cool while the others hangs outside the window to expel heat and moisture.\nWithout a window, you can take advantage of another room you aren\u0026rsquo;t using. This will mean that all the warm air and water coming from the AC\u0026rsquo;s rear will go into that other room.\nBut to achieve this, you have to make a hole in the wall that separates those two rooms and then seal around it to ensure the heat doesn\u0026rsquo;t sneak back. If there’s an adjoining door to both rooms, you can use that instead of a wall.\nSet up AC Vent through a Sliding Door If you are lucky enough to have a sliding door in the room, this would be the best option. Most sliding doors lead outdoors, either to a balcony or the porch.\nAll you have to do is slide open the door just enough to fit the AC and then use window treatment (curtains or blinds) to close the upper part. Let the AC run for at least 6 hours, which will be enough to lower the thermal temperature of your room to a stable level.\nIf you do this for, let’s say, 6 hours before closing the door and going to bed at 9 pm, the room should be cool and comfortable until the wee hours of the morning when it starts to get chilly.\nSet up an AC vent using a crafted ducting system Now, this method requires a little more ingenuity and some tools. That\u0026rsquo;s because you will effectively transform a window AC into a portable unit, which comes with an inbuilt vent and hose to take the heat and moisture outdoors.\nTo pull this off, you will need\nDuct tape Storage bin or cardboards Knife Flexible duct (click here to view it on amazon) The idea is to have the window AC deposit its heat into the trash bin connected to a duct leading somewhere else. Make sure the storage bin/cardboard box you make perfectly fits the AC rear side without blocking the side panels.\nCarefully drill two small holes at the bottom of your window unit. This is where condensation will drain out during the cooling process. Before you attach the bin to the AC, cut a hole or two at the bottom of the bin, where you will attach the flexible duct using tape. Again, this hole has to perfectly fit the duct because you don\u0026rsquo;t want any heat to escape. Now, join the bin to the AC and seal them together with tape and then attach the duct to the bottom of the bin. Guide the flexible duct to where you want the heat to go. Ideally, this should be outside through the door, kitchen hood, or window. Place a container below the AC where you drilled those holes to collect the condensation. For this to happen, you must tilt the AC somehow or place it on a raised surface like a stool. And with that, you have transformed a simple window unit into an indoor AC.\nTo get the flexible duct through the door, you must cut a hole in it and then seal the cut around the hose/duct with tape.\nHere are the full video instructions:\nhttps://youtu.be/rWQqH4lMTLQ\nWhy You Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Use a Window AC without a Window While the above three strategies are doable, they are not exactly foolproof.\nFor example, using another room to expel the heat exposes the other room to damage. Everything in that room, starting with the walls, will inhale all the heat and moisture and weaken. This damage may not be contained in that one room alone and can also move to other walls.\nThe self-built insulation setup or ducting system isn\u0026rsquo;t all that it\u0026rsquo;s cracked up to be. You must be very precise when joining those parts and even then, it cannot be able to hold hot air for long without developing some issues.\nIn short, these should be temporary solutions until you get something more feasible.\nBest Affordable Solution I get it, installing whole house air conditioning is not cheap or necessary sometimes. That’s why a window AC comes in handy. But if you don’t have a proper window, the best solution is a portable air conditioner.\nBesides being portable (you can move it from room to room), a portable AC comes with proper venting already built-in, so all you have to do is find a small space on your window or door to fit the hose that goes outside. You can place the AC unit anywhere in the room, provided the vent hose has outdoor access.\nI recommend this SereneLife SLPAC8 Portable Air Conditioner (click here to view it on amazon) because it\u0026rsquo;s compact, quiet, and already prebuilt with a dehumidifier and fan. You also get a remote control and a window kit with it to make installation easier for you.\nThat said, a window air conditioner is usually more efficient than a portable AC. This is because the entire backside of a window AC is used to expel heat, compared to only a small circle on a portable AC.\nIn other words, you must run a portable AC longer and use more power in the long run. But other than that, it’s the perfect alternative when you don’t have a window.\nFinal Thoughts Using a window AC without a window is possible but tricky. You must be prepared to damage something in your house, such as a door or even an entire room. Even then, the solution may not serve you long term and you have to keep worrying about something going wrong.\nThis is why I recommend getting a portable AC instead. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to install and use and has additional benefits, such as a dehumidifier and several operation modes.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/use-window-air-conditioner-without-window/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you use a window air conditioner without a window?

In this article, we’re checking the 6 most common causes, how to test your portable AC for them, and how to repair each of the causes.\nQuick answer: Place your portable AC in a room that suits its size. Insulate the hose and window kit using aluminum wrap and HVAC tape. Clean clogged air filters and the evaporator coil. Then, drain the water tank. Finally, make sure your portable air conditioner is set to cooling mode.\n6 Causes \u0026amp; Fixes for your portable air conditioner not cooling Sometimes portable air conditioners just won’t blow cold air. Here’s why:\nUse portable AC in a suitable room Portable ACs are when compared to regular AC units, relatively inefficient. Their cooling capacity is hardly enough for cooling medium-sized rooms. For large living room spaces, even though your portable air conditioner blows cold air, it could be that it’s not enough for cooling.\nHow to test: Turn on your portable AC and feel the air coming out. Is it cold? If yes, then your portable air conditioner is working. If you are not sure, you can test with a thermometer. The cold air coming out indicates that your portable AC works. The amount of cold air is, however, not enough to cool down your room notably.\nHow to fix: Either use the portable AC in a smaller room, or get a properly sized portable air conditioner for your room. For most living rooms, you need 14,000 BTUs of cooling capacity or more.\n“As a general rule, an air conditioner needs 20 Btu for each square foot of living space.”\nconsumerreports.org\nInsulate hose and window kit properly If your portable AC is properly sized for the room it’s in, a lack of proper insulation could also be the reason for your AC not cooling.\nThe reason is how a portable air conditioner works and is set up. A portable AC works about the same as a regular AC unit. However, there are two important differences\nMost portable air conditioners have only one hose to vent the hot air. This means it has to suck in the air from your room. This creates a negative pressure and causes warm air to enter your room. The insulation of the hose and the window kit. The insulation of a portable air conditioner’s window setup is usually non-existent. With a portable AC, you usually get a cheaply made plastic hose and window kit. This causes heat to reenter your room. How to test: Touch the hose of your portable AC when it’s running. Is it warm? If yes, this indicates that heat re-enters your room.\nHow to fix: Wrap your portable air conditioner’s hose with this insulating aluminum wrap (click here to view it on amazon). Make sure you seal most air gaps in the window kit setup. It’s usually not possible to seal everything perfectly because the generic kits are not properly sized for your windows. But do your best. You can also close any air gaps with duct tape or special HVAC tape.\nClean clogged air filters Portable air conditioners can stop cooling if air filters are clogged. An AC needs proper airflow for evaporating the refrigerant and for distributing the cold air.\nYou always have to ensure your portable air conditioner’s air filters are clean and free of dust.\nHow to test: Open your portable AC and check the filters. If you don’t know how to open it, check your manual. But usually, you can open the back side of your unit with a few screws or handles.\nHow to fix: Dry-brush your portable AC’s air filters. I highly recommend not to use water for cleaning air filters because the combination of water and dust is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria which you shouldn’t blow into your room. Also, your portable air conditioner will smell like an old vacuum cleaner.\nClean greased evaporator coil For proper cooling, similar to air filters, your portable AC’s evaporator coil needs to be clean.\nThe evaporator coil is the most important part for heat exchange in an AC. It absorbs the heat from the warm air in your room. Without it, the AC would not work.\nAny dirt or dust on it decreases the coil’s efficiency.\n“Keeping your evaporator coil clean and well-maintained is crucial to maintaining the efficiency of your system. Dirty coils can increase the energy use of your AC unit by up to 30 percent.”\nSamm’s Heating and Air Conditioning\nHow to test: Open your AC and check the evaporator coil.\nHow to fix: Use this evaporator coil cleaner (click here to view it on amazon) to remove oil, grease, and dirt from your coils. You can use an old toothbrush to get rid of the dirt. But you can also use special evaporator coil cleaners.\nDrain the water tank Your portable AC extracts humidity from the air during the cooling process. This accumulates water in your portable AC’s water tank.\nIf your portable AC has built-in overflow protection, it could automatically shut off or stop the cooling.\nHow to test: Check the water level in your portable AC’s water tank.\nHow to fix: Drain the water.\nSet your AC to cooling mode Aside from cooling, there are usually two other operating modes in a portable AC: heating and fan mode.\nIn heating mode, the portable AC produces heat. In fan mode, it blows air without heating or cooling (just like a regular fan).\nIt could be that your portable AC is not set to cooling mode.\nHow to test: Usually there’s a button or a sign on the portable AC panel telling you the mode it’s running. If you are not sure, check the manual of your specific model.\nHow to fix: Just change the mode to cooling mode directly on the front panel or using a remote.\nYour portable AC is still not cooling? If you followed all the steps in this guide and your portable AC is still not cooling, the problem is likely something that’s harder to fix.\nIt could be an issue with the electronic circuitry or a leaking duct system inside the portable AC.\nIn this case, you should either hire a professional to take a look at it, or you can also just get a new portable AC.\nPortable ACs are relatively affordable, so getting them fixed might not even be worth it.\nGenerally, I am always trying to fix broken devices, but when it’s not feasible, then it’s not feasible. Have a look at whether you can find out more about your issue in forums and videos.\nIn case you can fix it yourself, do it. Else, just get a new AC!\nConclusion To fix your portable AC not blowing cold air, make sure that you follow all the steps in this guide.\nThey are all regular maintenance checks that you should do on a regular basis. This ensures durability and improves the efficiency of your portable AC.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-fix-portable-air-conditioner-not-cooling/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow to fix a portable air conditioner not cooling?

This article is all about the size of generator you need to power a portable air conditioner. And, of course, how to do it safely!\nQuick answer: You can run most portable air conditioners on 2500W AC generators. For portable air conditioners with over 14,000 BTU cooling capacity, you need over 3000W generators. Make sure the generator is located outside to prevent carbon monoxide exposure indoors.\nLet’s see how to get to these numbers.\nHow much power does a generator provide? The amount of power a generator provides depends on the type of generator. Small-sized portable generators for camping, cabins, and RVs produce anywhere from 1200W to 3300W.\nOf course, there are bigger and smaller devices. You can find the exact wattage your generator provides on the casing.\nLarger portable generators provide a maximum powe r of 15,000W. And then there are home-sized generators that can supply all of your home’s appliances.\nThis article is about smaller-sized portable generators. If you have a large \u0026gt;15,000W generator, you don’t need to worry about power constraints.\nHow much power does a portable air conditioner consume? Portable air conditioners consume around 100W per 1,000BTU. An average portable air conditioner of 10,000 BTU consumes 1000W.\nBut that’s just an average value! In reality, the power consumption of a portable air conditioner varies.\nDuring peak power consumption, most portable air conditioners consume up to 2000W (or even more). Usually, a portable air conditioner draws such high amounts of power in the beginning of a new cooling cycle when it compresses the refrigerant to extract heat from your room.\nLikewise, there are slower times, when the air conditioner only blows out the cold air (without actively compressing). Then, it consumes only 200W to 500W depending on the temperature and fan settings.\nA generator can only run a portable air conditioner if it is rated to suit the peak power consumption of a portable AC. To find the peak power consumption of a portable AC, you can either use an electricity usage monitoring device or estimate.\nIn general, you can estimate the peak power consumption of a portable air conditioner to be twice the average power rating. On some portable air conditioners or on their packaging, the peak and average power consumption are documented!\nWhich generators are suitable for portable ACs? Generators rated at over 2000W should be safe for most 10,000 BTU portable air conditioners.\nHowever, this is a conservative estimate and I recommend getting a bigger generator than that. During peak power consumption, you are otherwise not able to power any other devices off the generator.\nIf your generator wattage is too small for the portable air conditioner then you risk damaging your generator, your AC, or both.\nBecause of this risk, I recommend getting a generator with at least 2500W - 3000W. Then, you are safe to power a portable AC. Also, you don’t have to worry about connecting multiple devices at once. You can keep powering other devices, such as your phone charger, simultaneously.\nHere’s a table of minimum generator sizes for different portable AC sizes.\nAir Conditioner sizeGenerator size8,000 BTU\u0026gt;1500W10,000 BTU\u0026gt;2000W12,000 BTU\u0026gt;2500W14,000 BTU\u0026gt;3000W16,000 BTU\u0026gt;3500W\nNote that these are minimum power ratings for generators. If you want to be safe, get a generator 500W bigger than specified.\nRecommended generator to power portable ACs This 3600W / 30A generator (click here to view it on amazon) is able to handle all regular portable ACs.\nIt is, however, a heavy product. Therefore, I’d recommend this one only if you use it in situations where you don’t have to carry it by hand a lot. It’s a good choice for RVing and cabins.\nHow to run a portable AC on a smaller generator On small generators, you usually are only able to power one portable air conditioner without any other devices connected simultaneously.\nIf you plug more devices into your small generator, you risk overloading and damage.\nTo prevent this, you should run your portable AC on moderate settings. You should only set target temperatures slightly below the current temperature on the thermostat.\nThis ensures that your portable AC does not draw too much power from the generator.\nIf there is an energy-savings or eco mode on the AC, make use of it. Oftentimes, you can halve the power consumption using that.\nIf there is no eco mode, just cutting the target temperature on the thermostat accomplishes the same goal.\nSetting eco mode and lower target temperatures should reduce the peak power consumption on most portable ACs.\nSafety considerations Usually, settings, where you power your portable AC from a generator instead of from a wall outlet, are when you are outside your home.\nOutdoors, in tents or RVs, you don’t have the same well-insulated walls as at home. The reduced insulation causes the portable AC to draw a higher average power than it would do at home.\nTherefore make sure that all the power cords are properly connected. Also ensure, that you use a proper heavy-duty extension cord, to prevent overheating.\nProtect yourself from carbon monoxide emissions Generators exhaust carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas. It is important to not expose yourself or your family to the generator’s emissions. Therefore, place your generator outside the tent, cabin, RV, or whatever room you are trying to run your portable AC in.\nPortable air conditioners themselves do not emit any carbon monoxide, only the generator does.\nAlso, placing the generator and AC in the same room would annihilate the purpose of the air conditioner, as the generator produces heat.\nSo, separate generator and AC in two separate rooms. The room of the generator has to be vented.\nConclusion You can run your portable air conditioner off a generator. However, make sure your generator is sized properly for your portable aircon.\nMost 2500W - 3000W generators should be able to handle most portable air conditioners.\nOf course, there are portable ACs that draw an exceptionally high amount of power. But if you possess such an AC, you likely already know that!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/run-portable-air-conditioner-off-generator/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you run a portable AC off a generator?

In this article, we’re going to cover a ton of different home-cooling methods, packed with advice.\nYou will find something suitable for your situation. Whether you need to cool your room without an AC, without electricity, or without windows. Everything is in here!\nI also included a few feel-cold methods that do not need any devices, which you can use anytime, anywhere.\nHere are the 20 cheapest ways to cool a room and house:\nFloor fans Floor fans are the most cost-effective way to move lots of hot air around your house. They come in different sizes and use anywhere from 40W to 160W of power.\nRegular air conditioners, in contrast, use anywhere from 800W up to 2000W of power depending on room size and temperatures. So, you see there’s a huge savings potential with floor fans.\nThe best thing about floor fans is that you can use them for multiple purposes:\nTo cool you down: Point the floor fan toward you. It will blow hot layers of air away from your skin, which makes you feel colder. This reduces the perceived temperature of your room. To vent your room: Place the floor fan in a window and make it blow fresh outdoor air inside. Usually, you should do that in the morning or at night. Floor fans are oftentimes significantly stronger than standing or pedestal fans. They do stand on solid ground and can use their full power to blow cold air around your home.\nStrong floor fans are oftentimes sold as wind machines online.\nI love floor fans! And that’s why they are my number one on this list.\nI personally recommend this 120W Lasko floor fan (click here to view it on amazon). It’s powerful!\nPedestal fans Pedestal fans have their own special role. While floor fans are best for wiping all the hot air out of your room or house quickly, pedestal fans are best for running them continuously.\nNot only do they use less power than floor fans but are, therefore, cheaper. They also come with features such as automatic rotation.\nThat’s practical when you want to have a long and continuous airflow to reduce the perceived temperature in your home. A slight breeze always makes you feel cooler.\nAdditionally, standing pedestal fans blow air from a base height, which you can oftentimes set.\nThis makes pedestal fans ideal for cooling down people gathering in your home. The rotating pedestal fan will distribute the breeze evenly in your room and help everybody cool down.\nPedestal fans are usually much weaker than floor fans.\nThat’s why I’d still recommend getting a strong floor fan if you have to decide between one of both. They are more versatile and move a lot of air around. Personally, a floor fan is enough for me!\nPortable ACs Portable air conditioners are great. But how are they on this list? With over $25 monthly electricity cost, using a portable AC is not the cheapest method on this list.\nHowever, I still list them in this list, because paying the running cost of a portable air conditioner is, in my opinion, very worth it.\nFirst off, a portable AC is a lot cheaper to install than a built-in wall AC unit. They barely have any maintenance. If you take care of your portable AC, they are basically, maintenance-free.\nWith a central AC you can expect to pay around $4,000 for the installation. A portable AC costs nothing to install.\nPortable ACs are, of course, not as efficient as regular central ACs.They are not as strong and they have a few technical drawbacks. But you can make your portable AC more efficient by insulating its exhaust hose properly.\nBut if you just want to cool your room for 1 to 3 months of high summer heat and you don’t need AC all year round, then I highly recommend getting a portable AC.\nOnce you have one, you never need to worry about cooling your room anymore. And when you don’t need it anymore, for autumn, winter, and spring, you can just place it in a storage room.\nWindow ACs Window ACs are basically the same thing as portable ACs. Only the installation differs slightly.\nIn contrast to fixed AC units, you can install and remove window AC units whenever you like. A window AC does not need any drilling through walls or the ducting that a regular AC would need.\nThe big advantage of window ACs is that they are more efficient than portable ACs. They are better-insulated and because of their placement in the window, they are able to move more air without expending as much energy. Portable ACs have to blow exhaust air through long hoses, which costs energy. Additionally, if the hose is not well-insulated, some of the heat will reenter the room.\nSo, if you have a window that allows for a window AC, then definitely get one! For the same running cost as a portable AC, you get more cooling capacity!\nEvaporative cooling Occasionally wet your skin. The evaporation extracts the heat from your body.\nAll you need is a towel and a bowl of water. Whenever you feel hot, wet your arms, your forehead and your legs.\nMost heat leaves the body through the head. So, if you are in a social situation and you can’t cover yourself in water, just slightly wetting your forehead already makes a big difference.\nThis one is by far the cheapest method to cool down your room. There is no cost involved other than the cost of water which is below $0.01.\nThe best aspect about this method, aside from it costing almost nothing, is that it can easily be combined with other methods.\nYou can boost your cooling, for example, even more by combining the ‘wet your skin’-method with a fan or AC.\nVenting at night One obvious thing to do is to vent your entire living space at night.\nWhen the outdoor air is cool, open your windows as much as possible. Ideally, you additionally place a strong fan in your window. I use my floor fan for this.\nThe fan then accelerates the distribution of cool air.\nIf you really want to cool down your house at night, then you should leave open the windows all night. Of course, in that case, you don’t have to run a fan additionally. Over 8 hours at night, the cold has enough time to distribute itself.\nI found that whenever I open multiple windows in different rooms, most of them close themselves at night time due to air drafts. This, of course, depends on the window type. Where I live, we have rotating windows, instead of shifting ones.\nFor this, I use climbing slings to keep the windows open. But you can use any other kind of rope. Attach one end to the window and the other to furniture or a door knob.\nKeep attic windows open to cool the entire house Very important, and often overlooked is keeping the attic windows open. This reduces the overall heat insulation of your home.\nThe reason is that heat always rises to the top. A roof insulates your home. In wintertime, this is a good thing, because the heat inside your home passes through the roof only slowly.\nHowever, in the summertime, you should avoid trapping heat in your home.\nKeep your attic windows open while it’s hot. The opening in your roof significantly reduces the overall insulation of your home and exhausts a lot of heat.\nOf course, remember to close your attic windows when it rains!\nShut off unused electronics All energy that electronic appliances consume ends up as heat. This is a consequence of the laws of thermodynamics.\nFor example, desktop computers usually draw 500W of power.\nThese 500W of power eventually end up as heating power in your home.\nRunning a desktop computer is therefore equal to running a 500W heater in your room continuously.\nBy the way: That’s why gaming computers need so much cooling: They do a lot more computational processing. Everything a computer does end up as heat. The more it computes, the more heat is released.\nThis does not only apply to digital devices such as smartphones, desktop computers, and gaming consoles! Anything that is plugged into your home\u0026rsquo;s electric circuit is actually a heat source. Lightbulbs, fridges, washing machines, everything.\nGet rid of this heating effect by shutting all unused electronic appliances off.\nMove large appliances to other rooms to cool your home\nOf course, you can’t shut all appliances off. Some things, such as fridges, have to run.\nSo, how do you get rid of the 100W - 250W of heat energy produced by fridges?\nYou can move these big, essential appliances into another room. In the high-summer heat, you can move your fridge to an unused room to lower the heat exposure in your used rooms.\nOftentimes, this is not feasible. Especially if you have a built-in fridge. But if you have a small living room fridge for drinks, then consider moving it.\nDrink lots of water Here’s another cheap way to stay cool: Drink a lot of water. In the summertime, you need to drink 2-4 liters of water as an active adult.\nDrinking plenty of water is not only refreshing but it actually helps your body handle the heat.\nSomeone who drinks enough water feels less hot than someone who does not drink enough.\n“It is important to replenish the water we lose when we sweat to prevent dehydration [\u0026hellip;] One of the best ways to accomplish this is to drink water throughout the day and before you actually feel thirsty.”\nhuffpost.com\nIce cube cooler fans There are fans you can fill with ice. The fan then distributes the cold air from the ice into the room.\nDuring this process, the ice evaporates. And that’s why these products are called “Evaporative Cooler Fans”.\nThey are relatively cheap to get, starting from $20-$30. However, they have a few drawbacks.\nEvaporative cooler fans are not efficient at all. The cold that they produce first has to be produced by your freezer through freezing water into ice cubes, which consumes electricity.\nThen, extracting the cold from ice is a very inefficient process. First, the ice cubes have only little cooling capacity: You can immediately tell that by holding an ice cube under running water. It melts within seconds.\nAnd second, evaporative cooling will add moisture to your room which can accelerate mold growth if you don’t vent.\nThird, these ice cube cooler fans have just a single application. You can only use them in the high summer heat. Otherwise, they make no sense. In contrast, a fan will serve you all year round. You can use it to vent your room at any time of the year.\nI prefer multi-use products and would stick to the proven floor fans, pedestal fans, and ACs.\nWalk barefoot Here’s another completely free method!\nWhere I live, there’s the saying “Hot feet, hot body, cold feet, cold body”. If your feet are cold, your whole body feels cold.\nThis is true regardless of the time of the year. Mostly, you notice it in winter when you warm your feet. Then, instantly, your whole body feels warm.\nIn the summer heat, you can make use of this! Just walk barefoot and you will feel much colder overall.\nAnd it’s healthy and strengthens your feet!\nGet a haircut Most heat is lost through your head. This piece of “motherly wisdom” is only true in wintertime, when our heads are unclothed and we should rather wear a hat.\nIn the summertime, heat is mostly lost through the head, arms, and legs, where we tend to wear shorter clothes.\nStill, just by getting a haircut, the amount of heat that leaves your body can be increased.\nYour hair traps air pockets. These act as heat insulators. When you cut your hair, you reduce the amount of insulation on your head and you feel significantly colder.\nRemove large and heavy objects from your room Air stores only very little heat. Most of the heat energy in a room is actually stored in the walls and objects inside a room.\nWe can’t really get rid of walls. But just by moving a few heavy objects out of your room, you can reduce the heat capacity of your room.\nUsually, the most impactful items are large metal or stone objects. Also, small (decoration) statues or vases, dishes, and flower pots store a lot of heat. Plastic or wood usually is bad at storing heat.\nThe absence of these heat stores ensures that after you close your window after venting or turning off your AC or fan, no heat is radiated back into the room through the heat-storing objects.\nExchange light bulbs Old light bulbs are inefficient. Instead of light, a huge part of their consumed energy is converted to heat.\n“Traditional or incandescent light bulbs were invented more than 100 years ago and are extremely inefficient. Only about 5% of the electricity they use converts into visible light.” energysavingstrust.org.uk\nThe other 95% are converted to heat. A medium-sized traditional lightbulb consumes 40W-60W of power. If you have 10 lightbulbs turned on in your home at the same time, that’s almost the equivalent of a space heater running medium 380W-570W heating settings.\nExchange your old light bulbs for newer LED bulbs and you can drastically reduce both the energy usage and cool your room at the same time.\nClose shades and window shutters Use shades to block sunlight from entering your room.\nThere are two different kinds of light-blockers:\nShutters located outside the window Shutters located inside your room Outside shutters are a lot better than indoor window shades.\nThe reason is that shutters absorb sunlight and then convert it to heat energy.\nIf your shutters are inside your room, they release heat into your room. If your shutters are outside, they release heat outdoors.\nUse outdoor shutters. Use indoor shades only if they can reflect the light outdoors (bright colored shades, or even white).\nKeep upper floor doors and windows open at night to keep your house cool\nSimilar to keeping your attic windows open, keep your upper floor doors and windows open at night. This improves the overall air circulation and reduces insulation.\nBy opening your upper floor windows at night, the cold air from the night will sink through the whole house.\nCold air always sinks. This allows for cold air distribution without using any noisy appliances such as fans.\nSleep in lower floor rooms Since heat rises upwards, rooms under the roof are disproportionally hot.\nAside from venting your roof’s windows to reduce insulation, another thing you can do is to just get as far away from below the roof as possible.\nMove to a lower floor to stay cool in your home during the high heat. Of course, this is only possible for homeowners or house renters.\nDon’t use oven and stove for cooking\nStoves and ovens heat up your room a lot. Using an oven or stove produces 3,000W of heat. That is as much as running two space heaters simultaneously!\nOne idea for the summer is to cook outdoors, in your garden, or on your balcony on a propane stove or grill.\nIf you have no opportunity to cook outside, then use the microwave as much as you can.\nOr avoid warm dishes in general.\nInstall an AC This list is all about the cheapest ways to cool a home. And here’s one method to surprise you: Install an AC.\nThe initial cost of AC installation is very high. However, in the long run, having an AC will save you lots of frustration. It will improve your overall quality of life.\nInstalling an AC improves your mental health and clarity in the summer. It keeps you well tempered.\nSo, while it costs a lot to set up an air conditioning unit in your home and it also increases your monthly electric bill, having an AC is a worth it investment.\nAnd that’s why I still include it in this list!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cool-room-house-cheap/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet’s talk about the cheapest ways to cool your room, your house, and yourself.

AC units provide the perfect conditions for mold to grow-oxygen, moisture and matter. And since they push air around your house, it means a moldy air conditioner will be blowing microscopic mold spores into the air you breathe.\nIf you suspect there could be mold in your portable AC, either because of seeing or smelling it, this article will help you solve that problem once and for all. But here’s the summary.\nQuick answer: You can remove mold in a portable air conditioner by cleaning the internals with a special mold cleaner. Wear protective attire such as goggles, gloves, and a mask, and then open the AC unit to inspect the inside and clean the components using AC cleaning brushes.\nLet’s have a look at the exact steps to remove mold from your portable AC.\nHow to Open a Portable Air Conditioner to Check for Mold To know the full extent of the mold growth, you need to open and take apart the portable AC so you can see inside.\nBut before that, turn off the AC, unplug it from the power source and take the unit outside. Be sure to wear protective gear before touching the unit to protect yourself from exposure.\nIt’s best to take care of mold outside where you have plenty of fresh air to avoid distributing mold fumes in the house.\nSome of the cleaners you will use are also not the safest to inhale, not to mention you will need to blow dust and debris out of the AC unit. To be safe, place the unit on an outdoor working bench or any stable elevated surface.\nNow that you have the unit outside in a safe space, it’s time to open it up.\nOpen the front grille Remove the front grille of the AC unit by pulling it forward and slightly pushing it down. This should be easy enough unless the grille is screwed in. If that’s the case, use a screwdriver to take off the screws and let the grille free.\nRemove the filter Take out the filter. The filter is the first thing you will see when the grille is out. Pull out the filter and put it aside for cleaning or disposal.\nRemove the front panel Remove the front panel. When you remove the filter, a metal front panel that locks in all the other AC components comes into sight. You need to pop this open as well by pulling it upwards or using a screwdriver if it\u0026rsquo;s screwed shut. The panel may be stuck a bit if you have never opened the unit so use some force or wedge it gently with a screwdriver. Keep track of the screws to avoid losing them.\nOptional: Take apart your AC further Take apart the AC unit. This point is optional and depends on the extent of mold growth. If it\u0026rsquo;s mild and you can\u0026rsquo;t see any traces back there, you can do the cleaning as it is now. Otherwise, take off the screws holding the AC unit to the cabinet cover to release the unit. AC components are heavy and delicate, so you must be careful and possibly have someone to help with the cleaning.\nLook at the parts. With the AC unit fully open and bare, you can clearly see the evaporator, the condenser, and every other part. These are the areas where mold will be hiding. If you\u0026rsquo;ve never seen a condenser or evaporator before, they usually have aluminum fins around them for protection.\nWhich Tools Do You Need to Remove Mold in a Portable Air Conditioner? Ready to clean up the mold now? Here’s what you need before we start.\nRemoving mold from a portable air conditioner requires a few special tools and products. Here’s the AC cleaning supply list;\nWater CLR or other mold removal cleaner Mild dish soap and bleach A bucket Clean cloth Scrub brush A vacuum cleaner with attachments Steps to Remove Mold from Your Portable AC Removing mold from a portable AC is a vigorous, though not difficult process. Once you identify the places where mold is growing and the possible causes, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to clean up from there.\nDrain the Water Air conditioners, including your portable unit, remove moisture and heat from the air. That condensation then collects into a tray inside the unit and should be emptied regularly through a drain at the back. If you are lucky, your AC has a hose pipe attached to get rid of that water every time it\u0026rsquo;s full.\nClean the Filter Again, depending on its condition, you can clean or dispose of the filter. If it\u0026rsquo;s a replaceable filter still in good condition, spray it with some mold removal cleaner and allow it to sit and soak.\nNext, use your scrub brush to scrub both sides of the filter until it\u0026rsquo;s sparkling clean. Finally, rinse it with plain water and hang it to dry.\nVacuum Dust Dust and debris stuck inside your AC are organic matter feeding mold growth and restricting airflow. The dust might also prevent you from seeing the full extent of the mold, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to start by vacuuming the inside of the AC. Moreover, vacuuming will suck in most of the mold spores, leaving the AC components safe for you to clean with your hands. Use a small vacuum attachment to really get in those corners and hiding places. Also, take a soft-bristled brush and clean anything that may be stuck on the coils or the wall surface. This AC clean brush set (click here to view it on amazon) is perfect for that job.\nSpray the Coils Coils are a critical and expensive part of any AC, and they also present a perfect hiding area for mold. To remove mold from the coils, spray a liberal amount of this CLR mold cleaner (click to view it on amazon) (or your preferred cleaner) all over and let it sit there for 15 minutes or so.\nAfterward, use a clean cloth and warm soapy water to wipe clean every inch of those coils and other components inside the AC. There is no proof that bleach or vinegar cleans mold better than soapy water, but you can add either of them to the water solution just for your peace of mind.\nUse another clean cloth in clean water to wipe away the soapy solution and rinse the AC clean. You should then go over them with an air conditioner cleaner or apply a mold-inhibitor using a cloth.\nThe best mold inhibitors are found right in your home and include tea tree oil, methylated spirit, vinegar/water solution, and oil of cloves.\nClean the Exterior While the panel and the grille are still out, take another soft, damp cloth and wipe them down thoroughly.\nAllow Everything to Dry To avoid encouraging any more mold growth, allow everything you have just cleaned to dry outside for at least 12 hours if it\u0026rsquo;s sunny and 24 hours otherwise. Once they are all good and dry, you can reassemble the unit and install it back in your room.\nThe steps I have outlined here will only work if the mold growth is still under control. If you open your AC and find that more than half of the unit is covered in mold, it’s better to get rid of that AC and buy another one. There’s a chance in this situation that you won’t be able to remove the mold completely, and it will grow back sooner than later.\nWhen in doubt, consult an HVAC professional or mold expert. They will advise on whether it\u0026rsquo;s worth cleaning the mold out or just getting rid of the entire unit. After all, portable ACs are not that expensive to purchase.\nHow to Prevent Mold Growth in ACs in the Future As you can see, removing mold from an AC is quite a task. You are better off preventing mold growth in the first place. But even if your AC already suffered from a mold infestation, these tips will help prevent another one.\nClean the AC Regularly There is no way around having a clean, mold-free portable AC- you have to clean it. This starts by cleaning the filter or changing it monthly to ensure airflow within the unit. Secondly, ensure there is no standing water inside the AC by emptying the condensation tray or checking the hose. You should also open the AC periodically to vacuum the dust and clean the components. A clean, dry unit is a more efficient AC, but most importantly, it\u0026rsquo;s not conducive to mold growth.\nKeep the Unit Running When people leave their homes for a few days or weeks, they often switch the AC to save power. This however is a mistake if the weather is still hot and humid. The airflow that occurs when an AC is running prevents mold development. To save power, set the home temperature higher so the AC will run less often instead of switching it off.\nWinterize the AC Your portable AC stays off when it’s cold. This provides a perfect environment for mold growth because it\u0026rsquo;s warm and dark inside there. To prevent this, open up the unit and store the pieces in a dry place. You will assemble it again when hot weather comes back and have a clean, mold-free air conditioner.\nFinal Thoughts The best way to remove mold from a portable air conditioner is by taking it apart and cleaning every inch with a mold cleaner. This is not an easy task. If that’s too much for you, I recommend hiring a professional to assess the mold damage and clean the components professionally.\nThat said, it is better to prevent mold growth by maintaining the AC unit regularly because mold is a dangerous fungus to live with.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/remove-mold-portable-air-conditioner/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow to remove mold in a portable air conditioner?

DeLonghi is widely known as a reputable brand that produces great electronics. Let’s have a look at whether you should spend the money or not!\nQuick answer: Yes, DeLonghi portable ACs are good, but they are more expensive than most other brands. The main advantages are that they are quiet, have more advanced features and some do not give off greenhouse gas emissions. However, for most people, there are many lower-priced air conditioners that will do the same job.\nAre DeLonghi portable air conditioners good? Are they any better than other brands? Overall, DeLonghi offers innovative products with some unique features and benefits, but the extra features come with a higher price.\nAffordability is a significant factor in choosing a suitable AC unit. You want to get your money’s worth.\nSo, let’s see what you (usually) get with a DeLonghi portable AC. Of course, the exact features differ by the specific model.\nAre DeLonghi Portable Air Conditioners any different? Delonghi portable air conditioners usually come with the following features:\nLCD control panel Smart mode Timer setting function Ventilation only function (cleans the air from the room without cooling) Heat pump Dehumidifier function Wifi connectivity That’s about the same features most other portable AC brands also offer. Of course, cheaper models will have reduced functionality. But above a certain price point, all portable ACs offer these features.\nOverstated marketing claims on DeLonghi portable AC sales pages DeLonghi offers units equipped with basic features all the way up to the De\u0026rsquo;Longhi Pinguino Care4Me, which is fitted with wifi connectivity and an artificial intelligence-supported thermostat to detect the room temperature and alter the temperature accordingly.\nHowever, that “artificial intelligence” should be taken with a grain of salt. I’d expect it to be a regular thermostat. At most, it has an advanced temperature control algorithm embedded (if even that).\nBut I am convinced that there is no real artificial intelligence. Since I can’t find any further information about that AI anywhere, except it being mentioned on sales pages, I suspect it’s a marketing claim.\nSalespeople throw these fancy words all over their product descriptions, but oftentimes they are plain wrong. If anyone from DeLonghi reads this and has evidence for AI with some more info, contact me. I am happy to correct my statements.\nDeLonghi portable AC quality depends on price point On the one hand, a reasonably priced DeLonghi unit is similar to many other affordable AC units. However, a high-end DeLonghi may offer technology that other brands have not yet incorporated.\nOverall, there are expensive and inexpensive DeLonghi Portable Air Conditioners, and depending on what you are in the market for, it depends on whether you will benefit from using DeLonghi.\nFor example, SereneLife, Whynter, or Black+Decker offer at least the same functionality, but at reduced prices.\nI would recommend you to check out this SereneLife portable AC (click here to view it on amazon) before you get a DeLonghi model!\nAlso, they are a lot more popular than DeLonghi.\nMany shoppers recognize the DeLonghi brand and assume it is automatically better than its alternatives. Although DeLonghi does offer a fantastic range of quality products, there are also many great competitors that you should consider.\nAre DeLonghi products better than other brands? Compared to its competitors, DeLonghi offers a more comprehensive range of products. You may be more likely to find a portable air conditioner unit with the exact features you require with DeLonghi. However, this does not necessarily mean DeLonghi products are better than other brands.\nAC units should be compared against other units with a similar price point, and DeLonghi is generally on the higher end when it comes to pricing, so DeLonghi should be compared against other high-end brands. The main benefit that DeLonghi products are known for is the relative quietness of the units compared to most other portable air conditioners.\nMany light sleepers have negative experiences with portable ACs due to the high noise level they produce. DeLonghi offers some of the quietest units on the market, with a quiet mode of 46dB. Although this is not silent, it is far less than the average dB of portable ACs, which is 56dB.\nAccording to Purdue University’s “Noise Sources and Their Effects” research, this is louder than a library, but quieter than a conversation at home. Quite good for an AC.\nLoudness****Description60dBConversation in restaurant, office, background music, Air conditioning unit at 100 ft50dBQuiet suburb, conversation at home. Large electrical transformers at 100 ft40dBLibrary, bird calls (44 dB); lowest limit of urban ambient sound30dBQuiet rural areaNoise comparison table\nBesides the unit\u0026rsquo;s quietness, DeLonghi and other leading brands such as Honeywell offer interchangeable benefits. When shopping for a portable air conditioner, you should first identify a price range they are comfortable with. Then you should compare the quality and features of each AC to identify the one that suits their personal needs the most.\nDespite quality and features being essential aspects of shopping for an AC, the price range is most important, as similarly priced products will usually have similar levels of quality.\nIs getting a DeLonghi portable air conditioner worth it? Any decent portable air conditioner will work wonders for your sleep quality and comfort throughout the day. There are many benefits to using a portable AC unit.\nHowever, Delonghi is one of the most expensive portable AC brands. So the question is, does Delonghi offer added benefits to its cheaper counterparts?\nThe simple answer is yes, but you can improve your comfort levels massively, even with a much cheaper portable AC.\nAny portable AC with good reviews is capable of cooling your house and creating a more comfortable environment. Also, all portable ACs come with the same main advantages compared to full air conditioner systems, such as\nCooling \u0026amp; heating only the room you are in reduces costs and saves energy Cheaper to buy Easy to move to a different room or household Easy to set up DeLonghi portable ACs come with fancy extras (you might never use) Whether you purchase a DeLonghi air conditioner unit, or a more affordable one, you will still experience all these benefits. However, if you buy a DeLonghi unit, you will receive extra benefits such as noise reduction and modern technological innovations like AI (if that\u0026rsquo;s really true, which I doubt), and Wi-Fi connectivity.\nWhether or not DeLonghi products are worth it depends on your budget. If you have a large budget and enjoy gadgets and luxuries, DeLonghi is worth it.\nIf you are on a budget and require a functional portable AC, you should not splash out on a DeLonghi.\nThe only time I’d recommend going over your budget when buying a portable AC, is if you have trouble sleeping due to noise. If you need silence to get to sleep at night, investing in a DeLonghi product would be a smart move.\nOr just use any regular AC and earplugs.\nAre DeLonghi ACs more efficient? DeLonghi ACs are not necessarily more efficient than any other brands’ units. The reason for this is that the energy usage of the conditioners is a result of the BTU (British Thermal Unit).\nThe BTU is the cooling power of a unit; a higher BTU is suitable for a larger room.\nThe energy consumption of a unit directly correlates with the BTU.\nOn average, a mid-sized portable AC uses at maximum cooling settings 2900 watts per hour, and a large-sized unit can use up to 4100 watts per hour.\nWhether you use a DeLonghi unit or one of its competitors, this figure remains the same.\nRather than picking a brand, pick the right AC size and insulate your home Shoppers can estimate the energy usage of a portable AC by its BTU. The average BTU for portable ACs ranges from 6,000 BTU for a small bedroom (150 square feet) to 14,000+ for a large room (400 square feet.)\nThese estimations assume that the user uses the AC in a well-insulated household and has placed it in an area with good airflow. If neither criterion is met, you could require a higher BTU AC to cool the same-sized room.\nWith global awareness of climate change growing, many people would like an efficient portable AC to reduce its impact on the planet.\nAn advantage of some DeLonghi portable AC units is that they do not give off greenhouse gasses. Instead, they use R290 propane, a refrigerant-grade propane that reduces environmental impacts compared to traditional alternatives. Air conditioning is responsible for 3.9% of the world\u0026rsquo;s greenhouse gas production.\nConclusion DeLonghi ACs are exclusive; they look and feel better and are quieter. Besides these advantages, DelLonghi products only offer the same experience that any other portable AC does.\nDeLonghi may be your best option if you are in the market for a top-of-the-range product.

There are two reasons why many homeowners ask this question.\nQuick answer : No, portable air conditioners do not give off carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is only created from fuel-burning devices such as furnaces, gas stoves, and generators. Portable ACs use electricity so there is no risk of them emitting carbon monoxide.\nHowever, there are a few uncommon situations whereby your portable AC could be involved in circulating carbon monoxide in your home. Read on to learn the real culprits you should be worrying about.\nWhy People Think Portable Air Conditioners Emit Carbon Monoxide If you haven’t seen a portable air conditioner up close, it has an exhaust hose on one side that goes outside the house through a window. The purpose of this hose is to expel the hot exhaust air and water vapor collected during the cooling process.\nSteam leaving the portable AC\u0026rsquo;s hose In certain conditions (air pressure, humidity, temperature, etc), the hot air can leave the hose in the form of a whitish smoky gas, similar to what your car exhaust or chimney produces.\nThis white gas is actually just steam and completely safe. When your room is very humid and outdoors it’s very cold, the emitted hot air condensates to tiny water droplets.\nThis is the number one reason why people think portable air conditioners emit harmful gases such as carbon monoxide.\nBut why does everyone worry about carbon monoxide specifically and not any other gas?\nCarbon monoxide-awareness in the US As I mentioned above, carbon monoxide is made by fuel-burning devices such as car engines, home heating systems, clothes dryers, power tools, boilers, gas stoves, and anything else that uses fuels.\nAs such, we are aware that many devices we use at home produce carbon monoxide. This is why furnaces have vents, gas stoves have a hood, and generators are used outside the house.\nIt’s only normal to imagine that your air conditioner works the same way as these other devices, especially when you see the smoke coming out of the hose. Also, when people hear that air conditioners use refrigerant (which is either gaseous or liquid) to carry the air around the AC, they imagine this gas is harmful or can leak into the house.\nHowever, the refrigerant used in ACs is made of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), not fuel, and they are completely harmless. Second, there is no way this gas can leak out unless you drop the AC and damage the components, in which case it can\u0026rsquo;t work anymore.\nCarbon monoxide is undetectable using just our senses So let’s put this myth to rest once and for all. Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless, and non-irritating gas that\u0026rsquo;s very challenging to detect without special equipment. This means you can\u0026rsquo;t see or smell it, and that white smoke is not carbon monoxide.\nThe danger with carbon monoxide, besides being undetectable, is that it tricks your body into thinking you are receiving oxygen, so the body stops taking in oxygen. With time, carbon monoxide replaces all the oxygen in your body, and you pass out because of a lack of oxygen. If no help comes soon, death is inevitable and that’s how 400 Americans die from carbon monoxide poisoning in their own home every year.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s critical that you stay aware of any device emitting carbon monoxide into your environment and take the necessary precautions.\nHow a Portable Air Conditioner can increase Carbon Monoxide levels A portable air conditioner on its own cannot produce or emit carbon monoxide or any other harmful gas. However, it can absorb or collect air with carbon monoxide and distribute it to the house.\nHere’s how:\nIndoor air circulation A portable AC contains a duct system that has a compressed liquid refrigerant. When you power on the AC, it draws in hot air from your house and pushes it through the ducts where it\u0026rsquo;s absorbed by the refrigerant and evaporates, turning into gas.\nThis gas is pushed outside to the compressor, and the compressor turns the gaseous refrigerant containing hot air into a liquid again.\nThe liquid then releases the heat and the moisture through the exhaust hose and starts the journey back to the house with cold air only.\nNow, if the air in your house has carbon monoxide already caused by your furnace, oven, or stove, the AC will absorb that air and return it back cold but still full of carbon monoxide.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s because the AC does not filter the air thoroughly enough to catch carbon monoxide. If you suspect carbon monoxide emission in your home, the best solution is an air purifier.\nPowering a portable AC with a generator While portable air conditioners use electricity for power, they can also be powered using a generator.\nThis is often useful for RV living or temporarily during construction work in the high summer heat.\nA gas-powered generator can emit carbon monoxide even when it\u0026rsquo;s not malfunctioning. As a result, your AC will absorb this carbon monoxide and circulate it all over your space.\nPortable air conditioner hoses allow carbon monoxide to enter the room The last though unlikely way your AC can contribute to carbon monoxide circulation is through the exhaust hose.\nThis hose goes through the window to the outdoors or another room. Sometimes, if there are carbon monoxide-producing devices outdoors such as a generator, running vehicle, or charcoal grill, your hose might allow that carbon monoxide to enter.\nThe amount of carbon monoxide entering is usually minimal, but it\u0026rsquo;s still something to consider.\nYou should therefore be very mindful of where the vent goes and avoid exposing it to fuel-burning components nearby.\nHow to Ensure Your Portable Air Conditioner is Carbon Monoxide Free To reiterate, a portable air conditioner does not produce carbon monoxide. However, it can draw in air that already contains carbon monoxide from the house or your outdoors through the vent. This air will then go through a cooling process and redistribute into your home.\nYou can avoid this unfortunate scenario in 3 ways;\nMaintain your fuel-burning devices regularly. If you have a gas furnace, oven, or stove, among others, keep up with the annual or bi-annual maintenance.\nYou should hire a professional technician to come and check that everything is still in working order and that there are no leaks or clogs anywhere. This will also mean maintaining your heating system by cleaning the vents, changing the filters, and so on.\nKeep outdoor fuel-burning devices away from the AC vent. I get it; you want to grill meat near the kitchen and fix the car right in the garage. But sure however that your AC vent is nowhere near these places. The window used to vent out a portable conditioner should be very far from your generator, garage or grill. Also, don\u0026rsquo;t under any circumstances use a grill or generator inside the house, and always open the garage door when the car or motorcycle engine is running.\nInstall a carbon monoxide detector. You should have a carbon monoxide detector at home. That’s a small device that detects critical levels of carbon monoxide and gives off an alarm.\nThis will not help prevent carbon monoxide production, but it will alert you when you have a problem.\nUnfortunately, these detectors only go off when carbon monoxide levels are quite high. If you notice that you and other family members are complaining of headaches, chest pain, dizziness and nausea, especially during the cold season when the furnace is on, have the house and the entire family tested for carbon monoxide.\nDo Portable Air Conditioners Emit Harmful Gases? Carbon monoxide is not the only gas you should worry about when dealing with machines and appliances. Thankfully, portable air conditioners do not emit any harmful gas, unless it\u0026rsquo;s made of substandard materials.\nFor instance, some cheap portable air conditioners come with a poor plastic window kit that will produce Volatile Organic Compounds when subjected to heat. This is something to look out for as you compare the prices and qualities of portable air conditioners out there.\nBesides quality, you also have to ensure the vent system is tight and well-secured. Poor quality vents have been known to come loose and leak the vapor and hot air into the house instead of taking them outside.\nI find that cleaning the ACs vent, condenser, and evaporator coils also helps to prevent any stinky smell.\nI recommend this AC clean brush set (click to view it on amazon) for the coil and air filter and also this evaporator coil cleaning foam (click to view it on amazon) to get rid of all the grime and dirt.\nNever ever use water to clean the inside of an air conditioner because it will only cause mold and malfunction. Always dry-clean everything!\nGo for high-quality portable ACs that are easy to clean. Too cheap portable air conditioners can be a health risk. And your health is expensive.\nConclusion Portable ACs do not release carbon monoxide or other harmful gases. However, if the surrounding environment already has carbon monoxide, the AC may draw in that air and distribute it inside your home. It\u0026rsquo;s therefore important to ensure the air around your AC vent is clean and free of harmful compounds.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/portable-air-conditioner-carbon-monoxide/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDo portable air conditioners give off carbon monoxide?

No fluff, just the facts.\nMy name is Daniel, I am an electrical engineer, and in this article, I am telling you all about the average running cost of portable air conditioners in different locations, for different models. You’ll find a formula to calculate the exact running cost of the portable AC you want to buy.\nAnd if you stick around to the end of the article, I am telling you exactly what to do to reduce your portable air conditioner’s electricity usage!\nQuick answer: The running cost of a portable air conditioner is around $25.20 a month for moderate usage (4h daily) and for the US-average electricity rate of 14 cents per Kilowatt-hour. You can reduce your portable AC running cost with a careful window setup and insulation.\nBut that’s only an average value. Let’s see how the running cost of a portable AC will turn out for you.\nHow much does a portable air conditioner cost to run? First of all, the running cost depends on many factors. One is the duration you use your portable AC each day. Another is the electricity rate you pay, which differs depending on your location.\nAnd of course, it depends on the power consumption of your portable AC.\nLet’s have a look.\nHourly, daily, and monthly portable air conditioner running cost Your portable AC running cost depends on how much you use your portable AC. If you use it twice the time, you pay twice the price.\nThe average electricity rate in the US is 14 cents per Kilowatt-hour.\nAlso, let’s assume an average power usage of your portable AC of 1500W. That’s a slight overestimation. Most ACs use around 1300W of power. The 1500W accounts for the high summer heat times, where your portable AC uses its maximum cooling capacity.\nIt’s always better to overestimate a little than to be surprised by an unexpectedly high electricity bill.\nWith an average power usage of 1500W and 14 cents per Kilowatt-hour, you pay 21 cents every hour you run your portable AC.\nHere’s a table showing you an average portable AC’s running cost for an average electricity rate, for different durations.\nDuration****Running cost1 hour$0.218 hours$1.6824 hours$5.0430 days (4h daily)$25.2030 days (8h daily)$50.4030 days (24h daily)$151.20\nOf course, you mostly don’t use a portable AC 24 hours a day for a whole month. They are noisy. And also, you are not always at home.\nEven 8 hours a day is a lot when it comes to averages. On a free Sunday, you might turn on your portable AC for 8 hours continuously. However, just the day after, at work, you work overtime and get groceries and you need your portable AC only for 2 hours.\nBecause of all these out-of-house times, I am using the 4-hour value as the most applicable average portable AC running time for most people.\nSo, the result of this first section is:\nRunning a space heater costs you $25.20 a month on average.\nPortable air conditioner running cost by state The running cost of a portable AC unit depends heavily on your local electricity rate. If you have the option to improve rates (by switching providers), then I highly suggest doing that.\nI collected a complete list of the current average electricity rates in all US states. For each state, I added the monthly cost of running an average 1500W portable AC for 4 hours a day.\n**StateAverage electric rate$ Monthly portable AC cost (4 hours daily usage)**Alabama14.28$25.70Alaska24.03$43.25Arizona13.21$23.78Arkansas12.19$21.94California27.02$48.64Colorado13.82$24.88Connecticut24.81$44.66Delaware14.3$25.74District Of Columbia14.76$26.57Florida13.58$24.44Georgia14.4$25.92Hawaii43.11$77.60Idaho10.29$18.52Illinois15.26$27.47Indiana15.16$27.29Iowa14.08$25.34Kansas14.12$25.42Kentucky12.81$23.06Louisiana11.97$21.55Maine25.75$46.35Maryland14.21$25.58Massachusetts23.85$42.93Michigan17.83$32.09Minnesota14.45$26.01Mississippi13.11$23.60Missouri11.95$21.51Montana11.2$20.16Nebraska11.08$19.94Nevada13.56$24.41New Hampshire23.05$41.49New Jersey17.00$30.60New Mexico12.95$23.31New York21.85$39.33North Carolina12.14$21.85North Dakota11.89$21.40Ohio13.74$24.73Oklahoma12.42$22.36Oregon11.56$20.81Pennsylvania15.2$27.36Rhode Island19.92$35.86South Carolina13.97$25.15South Dakota12.62$22.72Tennessee12.04$21.67Texas13.15$23.67Utah10.66$19.19Vermont20.49$36.88Virginia13.02$23.44Washington10.34$18.61West Virginia13.98$25.16Wisconsin16.1$28.98Wyoming11.51$20.72\nAs you can see, there are huge differences in the monthly portable AC running cost depending on the state you live in. In fact, in some states, you pay more than double other states\u0026rsquo; rates.\nThe most expensive \u0026amp; cheapest states to run portable ACs Especially Hawaii and Alaska pop out. They have incredibly high electricity rates. However, in freezing Alaska, you mostly do not care about air conditioning.\nOn the US mainland, New York, New Hampshire, and California are among the most expensive states. In each of those, you\u0026rsquo;d pay more than $40 on your monthly electricity bill just to run your portable AC.\nA short reminder: The US average monthly portable AC running cost is around $25.\nOn the cheap and affordable end of the spectrum are (among others) Utah, Washington, Missouri, Montana, and Nebraska. In those states, the cost is 50% lower than in the expensive states. Here you pay only about $20 a month. With 23$, Texas is in the lower-middle field.\nIt looks as if higher wage states are usually higher rates-states.\nSo, as you see, a very important indicator of your monthly portable AC cost is the location you live in. Where you live causes either significant savings or expenses as compared to the average. And you can hardly justify moving states just to reduce your portable AC expenses.\nLuckily, there are other things you can control to save money while cooling your home. Keep reading and I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you how to improve your portable AC\u0026rsquo;s efficiency and get the most cooling bang for your buck.\nPortable air conditioner running cost for different models Before we look at cost optimization, let\u0026rsquo;s see whether portable AC running cost depends on the model you have.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the power consumption of the three most popular portable AC models:\n**Model****Power consumption (Watt)****Cooling Capacity (BTU)****Efficiency (BTU per Watt)**Whynter ARC-14S130014,00010.77SereneLife SLPAC81100100009.09BLACK+DECKER BPACT08WT8008,00010.00\nI intentionally picked three ACs with different BTU ratings, found their wattages, and calculated the efficiency for each of them.\nBefore we look at the running cost, let\u0026rsquo;s first note one thing: We see that the power consumption (in Watts) directly increases with the cooling capacity of the space heater.\nThe amount of Watts a portable AC draws is one direct indicator of the running cost.\nAdditionally, in the third column, you can see how much cooling capacity (in BTUs) you get per Watt for each heater. The more BTUs you get per Watt, the higher the efficiency.\nInterestingly, all portable air conditioners have roughly the same efficiency in BTUs per Watt. Which is around 10 BTUs per Watt.\nEfficiency does not depend on the AC model If one model was significantly more efficient than another, then the efficiency value would vary more.\nBut it is apparent that all heaters, regardless of brand and model, give you the same amount of cooling capacity per invested Watt. For me, that means, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to get the most expensive portable air conditioner. The running cost of it will be the same as for a cheaper one and I won\u0026rsquo;t get much more cooling out of it.\nAs a rule of thumb, it seems that you can estimate the power consumption of a portable AC by dividing the BTU rating by 10.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s finish this section by looking at the exact running cost of the same portable air conditioners.\n**Model****Power consumption (Watt)****Monthly running cost (4h daily)**Whynter ARC-14S1300$21.84SereneLife SLPAC81100$18.48BLACK+DECKER BPACT08WT800$13.44\nTo calculate the running cost of each portable AC, I assumed the US-average electricity rate of 14 cents per Kilowatt-hour (kWh). You can see that running cost directly increases with the wattage. Wattage (as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen previously) directly increases with BTUs.\nThe brand and model of the portable AC do not matter. The higher the BTU number, the higher the running cost.\nNice to know: You pay on average $1.68 per 1,000 BTUs of cooling capacity per month.\nHow to calculate the cost of a portable AC? Calculating the cost of running your portable AC is actually very simple.\nJust do the following:\nCheck your portable AC’s BTU rating. Divide it by 10. That’s approximately the average power consumption (in Watts) of your portable AC. Note that number. Check your personal electricity rate. Ideally, you get the value from your latest electricity bill. But as a rough estimate, you can also pick your state’s average electricity rate from the big table above. Note that number. Use this formula to get your personal hourly portable AC cost:\nPower consumption (in Watts) × Electricity rate (in Dollars per kWh) / 1000 = Your personal running cost Ensure that you use the formula with your electricity rate in Dollars, not in Cents, eg. if you pay $0.20 per Kilowatt-hour, then use $0.20 in the formula, not the value “20” (Cents / kWh).\nHow to reduce Portable AC running cost All portable ACs have a built-in thermostat to sense the ambient temperature and control the cooling power.\nOn the thermostat front panel, or using a remote, you set a target temperature. This target temperature is the temperature that you ideally want your room to have.\nThen the AC takes care of your wishes.\nDecrease power consumption through clever usage You can reduce your portable AC’s running cost by setting realistic and moderate thermostat target temperatures. This ensures that your AC is running within its capacity.\nIf you set a rather moderate target temperature, just a few degrees below the current temperature, the AC will cool only for a short period and then switch to an energy-saving mode when the target temperature is reached.\nIn this energy-savings mode, the portable AC will wait until it senses an increase in the current room temperature again. Only then will it power the compressor again to cool the room.\nThat’s the magic of thermostats: They automatically turn on and off the device in order to reach the temperature you wish. Some thermostats, don’t even turn on and off the device entirely. Some use complex computations to find the optimum power consumption to reach the target temperature. But that’s another story.\nReduce average power consumption through moderate settings If you use your portable AC with moderate cooling settings, the average power usage will be significantly reduced.\nHowever, if you set a target temperature that is too low, your portable AC will run in maximum power consumption mode endlessly.\nThe main reason is a limitation of portable ACs: Because they are blowing air out through one hose, they create negative air pressure in your room. This negative air pressure sucks in hot air from neighboring rooms and from outside (through door and window gaps and anything else that is poorly insulated).\nIn this case, the hot air coming into your room cancels out the cold air produced by the portable AC and the temperature does not change.\nThis means, that every portable AC has a limit on how much it can cool. If you set a target temperature that’s below this limit, your portable AC will run on full power all the time causing a very high electricity bill.\nThe solution is simple. Don’t overwork your little cooling buddy:\nJust by setting realistic, moderate settings, you can save up to 30-50% on your AC\u0026rsquo;s electricity bill.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t expect a portable AC to cool an 86°F (30°C) room to 64°F (18°C).\nBig fixed wall AC units can accomplish this. Your portable AC can’t.\nReduce AC power consumption through proper installation First of all, make sure that your windows and doors are closed.\nThen, ensure that your AC’s window hose kit is properly sealed. Check that there are as few gaps as possible.\nI know that it is almost impossible to perfectly seal your window using the window kit you received together with your portable AC. At least this has been the case for me. All windows have different shapes and sizes.\nSo, when you get your portable AC window ket, it is usually a one-size-fits-all product. Or you ordered some custom-length window kit. But still, it does not fit perfectly.\nNevertheless, carefully install the window kit and do your best to close as many gaps as possible.\nInsulate the hose Portable ACs always run in bursts of cooling (you can hear a change in sound when the compressor starts extracting heat, just like in a fridge). During that time, feel the exhaust hose of your portable AC. You notice that it feels very warm.\nEven the fact that you notice it getting warm means that the heat re-enters your room. The heat that should leave your room through the exhaust hose leaks through the hose. Either it penetrates the badly insulating plastic material, or there are actual holes in the hose.\nYou can fix this using an additional hose insulation wrap.\nCheck that there are no holes in the hose. Holes are very easy to fix using regular duct tape. Or you can use a special insulating HVAC tape.\nAre portable ACs as efficient as regular ACs? I wish I could tell you portable ACs are as efficient as regular ACs, but most aren’t. Most portable air conditioners are single-hose models.\nSingle-hose portable ACs are not as efficient as regular ACs.\nThe major downside of almost all portable ACs is that they come with one hose only to blow the heat out of your room. This one hose sucks in the air from your room. However, this creates a suction (negative pressure) in your room which sucks in the hot air from other rooms or even from outside.\nThis heavily reduces the efficiency when compared to regular ACs.\nThere is one type of portable AC that does not have this downside: Dual-hose portable air conditioners.\nThese portable ACs suck in air from outdoors, extract the heat, blow the cool air into your room and then blow the extracted heat out of your room.\nMy favorite dual-hose portable AC is the Whynther ARC 14S (click to view it on amazon). It is more efficient than any single-hose portable AC.\nThe second hose compensates the suction effect and gives us almost the same efficiency as a regular AC unit. The only downside a dual-hose portable AC has when compared to a regular AC is the length of the airways (hoses). To overcome the length of the airways, the fans have to be stronger and waste a part of the energy that could be used for cooling.\nDual-hose portable ACs are almost as efficient as regular ACs.\nWhen to get a portable over a window or wall unit? Portable air conditioners always come with a cost. While they are practical for moving them around the house wherever and whenever you need them, they lack the efficiency a “real” window unit or a wall unit provides.\nI’d say you should get a portable AC if you don’t want to or you can’t install a regular AC your living space.\nAlso, a portable AC will do a perfectly sufficient job if you just want to cool down a regular-sized room occasionally.\nWhenever you want to spare yourself installation hassle, cost, and professional help, get a portable AC.\nConclusion Portable air conditioners are heavy-duty appliances and need lots of power to cool your room. However, clever usage (through picking the right temperature), as well as a proper setup with hose insulation and a carefully sealed window will improve your portable AC\u0026rsquo;s efficiency.\nThe monthly running cost of a regular portable AC with moderate usage is around $25, which is a worthwhile investment. At least I\u0026rsquo;d rather pay $25 for a reliable cold breeze than melt in the high summer heat.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/portable-air-conditioner-running-cost/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHere’s everything you need to know about portable air conditioner running cost.

If so, why do all air conditioners need a hose? And can you use a portable AC without a hose?\nQuick answer: Yes, all portable air conditioners need to be vented. The heat extracted from the air has to leave your room, otherwise, it will mix up with the cold air again. Ventless ACs are a marketing scam and never work.\nLet’s have a closer look.\nWhy do portable air conditioners need to be vented? First of all, the main point of a portable air conditioner is to reduce the temperature in your room. An AC does that by blowing out cold air. Simple, right?\nBut where does the cold air come from? The cold air is the air from your room but without the heat.\nThe heat is extracted in a cooling process similar to a refrigerator’s. A compressed liquid refrigerant evaporates to gas due to the hot air in your room. The from your room is converted to another form of energy, stored in the gas.\nThis causes the amount of heat in your room to decrease.\nThen, the gaseous refrigerant goes through a duct system to another part of the AC where a compressor compresses it to a liquid again. The compressing releases the heat energy from the refrigerant again.\nThat’s where it gets interesting. Let’s see what happens when your portable air conditioner does have a hose attached.\nOn the back side, the portable AC vents the heat.\nCold air comes out of the front of the AC, while hot air leaves on the back.\nIt takes only a short time until the hot and cold air mix up again. And we are back where we started.\nAnd it gets even worse than that:\nBecause the compressor and the fans are moving parts, they create friction. That friction results in additional heat being released.\nSo, leaving a portable air conditioner running without venting the hot air is actually worse than not running a portable AC at all.\nThere’s even a law in physics describing exactly this: The second law of thermodynamics. It states that the entropy in a closed system always increases.\nIt took me a while to grasp that concept in engineering class, but here’s the law in simpler terms, applied to the air streams of an air conditioner:\n“Due to the second law of thermodynamics, the hot stream is heated by more than the cool stream is cooled. So mixing the two together will result in a net heating effect”\nSolandri on tomshardware.com\nSo how do we fix this? You use a hose to blow the extracted heat out the window. This way, the cold air stays in your room, while the hot air leaves.\nHow to vent a portable air conditioner Now that you know why you always have to vent a portable air conditioner, let’s look at the best way to do that.\nVent heat out the window First of all, the most popular choice for most people is to vent the hot air out the window. All “real” portable air conditioners come with a hose and some additional parts to fixate this hose to an opening in the window.\nVent into another room Alternatively, it is also possible to vent the heat into another room, such as a bathroom, where you don’t care about the temperature. However, depending on the insulation between the rooms the heat will re-enter your room more or less fast. It depends on the material of your doors, the size of the door gaps, etc.\nAlso, venting the heat to a neighboring room could, in the long run, damage furniture, wooden floors, and wooden ceilings as they are all sensitive to high temperature and moisture. Ideally, the neighboring room you vent the heat into, should, therefore, have an open window.\nI suggest venting into another room only for short periods of time in the high summer heat. Any venting longer than a few weeks in a row will likely wear down the room noticeably.\nVent out the chimney A third option is to vent a portable air conditioner through a fireplace or oven. Since these are connected to your chimney, which, in turn, is an opening to the outside, venting air conditioner heat through a chimney is technically the same as venting through a window.\nThe only difference is that the airways are longer and therefore, because of the chimney effect, there will be a higher suction force pulling in more heat from other rooms into your room.\nAlso, venting out the chimney will likely pollute your air conditioner\u0026rsquo;s hose. And, in the winter months, when you use your fireplace to heat, there’s a risk of fire when you insert the air conditioner hose. But I guess you won’t use an air conditioner in winter, so that’s just a theoretical issue.\nYou probably agree that you should vent your portable air conditioner out the window. It is the best option of all 3 and has no negative side effects.\nProper venting saves money and increases cooling efficiency You can maximize your portable air conditioner’s cooling efficiency by venting it properly. Here’s how:\nFirst of all, if your portable air conditioner came with a junk-quality window kit, then I’d suggest looking for a better one. A good window kit helps with insulation by using better materials and by not leaving any air gaps.\nAlso, you can insulate the exhaust hose using a hose insulation kit. This prevents heat from re-entering the room while it’s on its way out.\nTo insulate your portable AC hose, I recommend this insulation wrap (click here to view it on amazon).\nAlso, ensure that there are no holes in your portable air conditioner’s hose. If you find any, fix them using this HVAC tape (click to view it on amazon) (regular duct tape is fine as well).\nAdditionally, ensure that you position your portable air conditioner properly. Ensure that the air easily flows out of the window by checking that there are no kinks in the hose.\nThe less work the AC fans have to do, the less air movement is involved in cooling and the less air re-enters your room through door gaps. That’s one of the reasons window ACs are more efficient than portable ACs: They cause less air movement.\nAre there portable air conditioners that do not need to be vented? When you are looking to buy portable air conditioners online, you will find tons of “ventless” portable air conditioners. Why would you even pick a portable air conditioner with a hose if you can pick a model without one?\nAs we’ve already seen, any ACs without an exhaust to the outside of your room is a scam product. They don’t work physically.\nThey might extract the heat for a short time. But within a few seconds or minutes the cold air and the hot air mix again.\nIf you ever see a portable AC without a hose, you immediately know, it’s a scam product.\nConclusion All portable air conditioners need to be vented! There’s no way around it. If you use your portable AC without venting the heat outdoors, you will even get a net heating effect.\nSo, it’s pointless to use a portable air conditioner without venting the air.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/do-portable-air-conditioners-need-to-be-vented/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDo all portable air conditioners need to be vented?

It might be because you fell victim to a marketing scam.\nDon’t fall for hoax portable air conditioners There are even more hoax portable air conditioners on the market than real portable air conditioners. Let me explain.\nThe HVAC industry has one problem: Air conditioners require effort to install, are loud, and are expensive to produce. People only buy air conditioning if they really need one. Additionally, the profit margin is small due to international competition.\nThe HVAC industry does not make the amount of money it wants to make. Therefore it tries to create high-profit-margin products that are both cheap to produce and easy to set up for customers.\nThis reduces production costs but increases demand. The resulting products are small, lightweight air conditioners without hoses for small rooms.\nOftentimes you have to put water or ice into these portable air conditioners.\nI’ve seen these being sold in the thousands online!\nBut here’s the problem: These small portable air conditioners don’t work at all. You can even prove that using simple physics equations.\nThe law of conservation of energy states that the amount of energy in an enclosed system never changes.\nThe temperature in a room can only be changed by introducing an opening into that room and pushing the heat out of the room.\nReal air conditioners use using a hose to connect to the outside. That’s the single difference between a “real” and a \u0026ldquo;fake\u0026rdquo; AC.\nNo AC in the entire universe will ever be able to change the temperature of a closed room.\nHow to know whether your portable air conditioner works? Whenever you see a portable air conditioner or air cooler without a hose, you immediately know it’s a scam. Simple physics.\nThere are a few other red flags that most fake portable air conditioners have in common: They are small in size and can easily be carried by one person. But real air conditioners need size. They contain a heavy duct system with a compressor, fans, and electric circuitry.\nA portable air conditioner is never a small device.\nWhich portable air conditioners work? You can tell a real portable air conditioner from a fake one if it has a hose, is heavy, and is of proper size.\nPortable air conditioners are always heavy-duty devices. Also, they draw lots of power.\nFake portable air conditioners usually have no BTU rating. Whenever you see a portable AC without a BTU rating, you immediately know it’s fake.\nHowever, this does not mean that all ACs with a BTU rating are trustworthy: some junk portable air conditioner vendors put false BTU rating claims into their product descriptions.\nOftentimes, fake portable AC descriptions contain the words “dehumidifier” or “evaporative cooler”. Watch out for those.\nReal portable air conditioners do not require any refilling of water. Rather they extract the humidity of the air, which you have to drain.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a video of me explaining which portable air conditioners are safe to buy:\nhttps://youtu.be/uzxJZy5HF3o\nConclusion You do not have to put water into a portable AC.

Do you need to put in any maintenance work? Your portable AC\u0026rsquo;s efficiency decreased any you suspect the refrigerant needs a refill?\nQuick answer: Portable air conditioners never need regassing. Portable ACs are fully enclosed systems and refrigerant will never leak if the device is not broken. If it is broken, you should just replace it with a new one and not worry about maintenance.\nBut before you leave, let’s have a closer look. I’ll tell you what to do if your air conditioner does not do a good cooling job anymore. Also, we’ll see how to deal with HVAC companies trying to sell you recharging of your portable AC.\nDo Portable Air Conditioners need Regassing / Recharging / Refilling? A portable air conditioner refrigerant is fully enclosed inside its duct. Ideally, no refrigerant should ever leak.\nAn intact portable AC is never going to lose efficiency because of leaking refrigerant. The refrigerant only ever leaks if you let your portable air conditioner fall from a height and damage some of its parts. Sounds unlikely to happen? It is.\nTherefore, we can say that\n“Portable air conditioner refrigerant is fully enclosed, never leaks and, therefore, never needs regassing.”\nme\nIf you are sure that your portable AC leaks refrigerant, keep reading. I’ll tell you what I’d do in that case.\nDoes portable air conditioner refrigerant ever go old?\nNo, portable air conditioner refrigerant never goes old. It should, therefore, always perform at the same efficiency level.\nPortable air conditioners (and ACs in general) are designed for little maintenance. The cleaning of the filters is annoying enough. It would be pointless if air conditioner producers produce leaking refrigerant ducts or refrigerant that turns greasy.\nLuckily, we are in a competitive market and companies try to build the best products to outsmart their competitors. They take care that you can rely on the refrigerant without maintenance.\nYou can expect your portable air conditioner to reliably run for a decade or more given you take care of it.\nWhat to do if portable air conditioner loses efficiency If your portable air conditioner is not as efficient as it used to be, it is almost impossible to happen because of leaking refrigerant. I mean, it could be if your portable AC is damaged. But that is highly unlikely. Before the ducts containing refrigerant break, more sensitive parts of your AC such as electronics would break. And in that case, you would not be reading this article.\nSo, if your portable AC looks good from the outside, I’d bet the ducts are fine.\nAn air conditioner is not like a car, where you have to refill oil. The refrigerant never leaves the system.\nMuch more likely is that your air conditioner’s efficiency suffers from blocked airways. Blocked airways are the most common cause of all AC problems.\nThey prevent proper heat exchange in the evaporation part of the AC. The refrigerant is not able to absorb enough heat from your room. And also it decreases fan efficiency.\nHow to clean and maintain your portable AC for lasting efficiency Open the casing of your portable AC and remove all the dust using a dry brush, compressed air gun, or duster. Clean the filters!\nNever use water to remove dust! (I have stories to tell, but let’s skip them)\nIf you clean your portable AC’s airways with water, mold will grow and your portable AC will turn into a portable air “stinkifier”.\nAlso, make sure to clean the condenser and the evaporator coil!\nI recommend you get these AC cleaning brushes for air filters and coil(click here to view it on amazon).\nAlso, to get all the dirt, grease, and oil off your coil you should invest in this evaporator coil cleaning foam (click to view it on amazon).\nAir conditioner coil cleaning foam\nThe brushes and the cleaning foam are a great investment in the health of your portable AC (and of course, they also work for any regular AC). They can lengthen the lifespan of your AC by years!\n“The first thing to try, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already is to clean the condenser and the evaporator coil, as well as your filters.”\nmember of moneysavingexpert.com\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all you have to do to maintain a portable air conditioner properly. If you want to increase the efficiency even more, have a look at my article on how to increase portable air conditioner efficiency.\nRecharging / Regassing portable air coinditioners is a hoax If an HVAC professional offers you to recharge your portable air conditioner, all he has in mind is recharging his purse.\nAlso, recharging is a reliable business. If an HVAC professional sells someone on “recharging”, he’s got a new recurring client to sell the recharging to every single year.\nRecharging portable ACs is an HVAC marketing trick. Tell your family and friends in case they lose their money by getting their portable ACs recharged.\nWhat to do if your portable AC REALLY leaks refrigerant If your portable AC really leaks, there is no reason to keep it. If it leaks, it’s broken. But please write me a mail and tell me how that happened.\nIn this case, I recommend replacing your broken portable air conditioner with a new one.\nTechnically, it is possible to regas it, if you know how (I don’t know how).\nThe main problem is, in my opinion, that regassing requires constant additional maintenance. It costs you both yearly effort and money to keep the refrigerant level stable (as it should be anyways).\nJust get a new portable air conditioner and stop worrying about keeping up with a broken portable AC. Or do you drive a car that leaks fuel?\nThis will save you a major chunk of expenses in the long run.\nConclusion Portable ACs never need refilling. If your portable air conditioner loses efficiency, the reason is likely dirt inside your AC.\nRegularly clean the condenser, evaporator coil, and air filters. My advice is to always take care of your portable AC. It will last you decades then.\nHope this was helpful!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/do-portable-air-conditioners-need-regassing/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDo portable air conditioners need regassing?

Air conditioners work “magically” and nobody ever fully gets them. As an electrical engineer, I try to break up the answer to this question into digestible chunks everybody can understand.\nQuick answer: Like a regular air conditioner, a portable air conditioner cools the air by evaporating a refrigerant that carries the absorbed heat from your room outdoors. Since a portable air conditioner has no outdoor parts which ensure that no heat is carried back into the room, it is not as efficient as a regular air conditioner.\nDon’t worry if you do not understand the quick answer. We’re going to have a look at everything in a little more detail.\nHow does an Air Conditioner work? To understand how a portable air conditioner works, we first have to look at regular air conditioners.\nAt the first glance, we see that air conditioners contain a duct system. These ducts contain a compressed refrigerant. Normally, this refrigerant is gaseous. But when it is compressed (under high pressure), the refrigerant becomes a liquid.\nEngineer’s note: This is actually the case for any gas, not just the refrigerant. When you apply pressure to a gas, it becomes a liquid. The reason is that the individual gas atoms or molecules don’t have much wiggle room when they are under pressure, so they behave like a fluid. The same happens when you cool down a gas, by the way. The only difference between the special refrigerant gas and any other gas is that the refrigerant is designed to evaporate and liquidate at around room temperature.\nSo, we have a duct containing the compressed liquid refrigerant. In hot air, the refrigerant absorbs the heat and evaporates, and becomes gaseous (think: evaporated refrigerant contains heat energy).\nThen, the evaporated refrigerant is led outside, to a compressor, which usually is attached to the outside wall of the house. The compressor compresses the gaseous refrigerant, which turns it into a liquid again. You can think of compressing as the reverse action of evaporation.\nThis means: The refrigerant becomes liquid again and releases heat.\nRemember:\nThe refrigerant absorbs heat inside through evaporation and becomes gaseous. Think: In gaseous form, refrigerant carries heat energy. The refrigerant is pumped outdoors where a compressor compresses it and turns it into a liquid again. The refrigerant releases the absorbed heat outside through condensation. The process is cyclomatic. An AC needs electricity to power the compressor (to compress the refrigerant and release heat) and to power the fans which distribute the hot and cold air.\nThis air conditioning process cools down your room.\nWhat’s the difference between a regular and a portable AC? So, what exactly does a portable air conditioner do differently? Technically, there is no difference between a regular AC and a portable AC. Everything works precisely the same. At least when viewed on an abstract level.\nThe main difference between portable air conditioning and regular air conditioning is just the assembly of the device.\nWhile a regular air conditioner consists of separate, but connected components located inside and outside of a room, a portable air conditioner is a single device.\nIn a portable AC, all the parts, the ducts, the compressor, the fans, etc., are sitting inside one encasing. This makes the whole thing portable.\nSo, the difference between a regular and a portable air conditioner is not technical, but rather a design difference.\nNevertheless, a portable air conditioner still accomplishes the same task as a regular AC. It compresses a refrigerant, blows cold air into a room, and extracts heat from a room.\nPortable air conditioner types There are three types of portable air conditioners.\nPortable air conditioners come in two variants:\nDual-hose portable AC: One hose for sucking in air from outdoors, which is then cooled in the AC system, and another hose for blowing hot air outdoors. Single-hose portable AC: A single hose for blowing hot air outdoors No-hose portable ACs: These are, in my honest opinion, a hoax. Portable air conditioners need a hose to expel the hot air outdoors. Portable air conditioners without a hose blow both cold and hot air into your room. Doesn’t make sense, right? No-hose portable ACs are a marketing scam and are just fancy fans. The dual-hose portable ACs the most efficient of all three types. This means for the same amount of electricity cost, you get the highest cooling effect with a dual-hose portable air conditioner.\nDual-hoses do not need to suck any indoor air. One hose carries outdoor air into the device, which is then cooled. The other hose carries the excess heat outdoors. The Whynter ARC-14S portable air conditioner (click here to view it on amazon) is by far the best-rated portable air conditioner mainly because it uses a dual hose system and therefore works the best.\nSingle hose portable ACs, however, pull hot air from your room, cool it, exhaust the excess heat and blow the cool air back into your room. Since the AC sucks air from your room, your room is under negative pressure which causes hot air from other rooms to enter through the door gaps.\nThis significantly reduces the efficiency of single-hose portables when compared to dual-hoses.\nNo-hose portable air conditioners do not work at all. They might produce cool air. But where does the extracted heat go? Well. It goes right back into your room. Do not even think about buying a portable air conditioner without hoses. It won’t work.\nAre regular or portable air conditioners more efficient? In a portable air conditioner, all of the parts that would be separated across different locations in a regular air conditioner, are gathered close to each other inside one encasing.\nBecause all the parts sit closely together, there is heat exchange between them. And heat exchange between parts always reduces efficiency.\nThe parts extracting heat and the parts producing cold air are not in two separate devices as in a regular heater. This means the hot parts transfer a part of the heat back to the cold parts.\nAside from the insulation inside the portable air conditioner, portable air conditioners often come with cheaply made hoses. These also leak heat (either by heat passing through the thin material or even by actual air leaks), which reduces the efficiency a bit more.\nAnd on top of that, the efficiency of a portable air conditioner depends on proper setup. A portable air conditioner can only be efficient when the hoses and the window kit are connected tightly and everything is sealed properly.\nWhen to choose a portable over a regular air conditioner? There is a reason why you see regular built-in air conditioners are the go-to choice for most homeowners.\nA regular air conditioner has higher efficiency. Everything is set up once. After that, the efficiency does not depend on how well you tighten hoses or how you place the AC. Also, a regular AC does not occupy any floor space.\nHowever, built-in air conditioners come at a higher initial cost and furthermore additional maintenance costs.\nA portable air conditioner, meanwhile, is quick to set up and is cheaper. Also, it’s portable and very easy to replace. A portable air conditioner can save you a lot of headaches.\nYou should get a portable air conditioner if you want to save money, if you want to use your portable AC in multiple locations, or if you just don\u0026rsquo;t want to install a fixed system.\nPersonally, I say that you can get a great air conditioning experience as long as you set up your portable air conditioner correctly. Ensure you connect your portable air conditioner hoses tightly to the window kit. Also, make sure that there are no leaks and that everything is well-insulated. And I absolutely vouch for the dual-hose portable air conditioners. They are as close as you can get to the regular built-in AC experience.\nA dual-hose portable AC is a great choice for quick and portable access to air conditioning.\nFor home use, to get the most out of your portable air conditioner, you should always consider maximizing the efficiency (here’s a guide on how to make a portable air conditioner more efficient).\nIn short, you should keep your room well insulated, windows and doors closed and you should seal all leaks in the ducts using HVAC tape.\nConclusion Portable air conditioners work just the same as a regular air conditioners. The only difference is in the arrangement of parts. While a regular air conditioner consists of separate devices placed indoors and outdoors which are connected through ducts, a portable air conditioner is a single device, which you can move anywhere.\nPortable space heaters are handy to use anywhere you desire air conditioning. However, they have lower efficiency when compared to a built-in system.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-does-a-portable-air-conditioner-work/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow does a portable air conditioner work?

Portable air conditioners can turn into a money drain if you don’t use them properly.\nThis article is all about helping you to make sure that you are running your portable air conditioner at the highest efficiency.\nAfter reading this, you’ll know exactly what to do in order to increase the cooling power of your portable AC while maintaining low electricity usage and therefore lower cost.\nQuick answer: You can make a portable air conditioner more efficient by insulating your room and the exhaust hose. Also, old portable air conditioners are inefficient. Replace your old air conditioner with a new one. Additionally, run your portable AC at moderate settings since that’s where the efficiency is highest.\nLet’s have a look at all these steps in a little more detail.\nImprove the air conditioning efficiency in your environment You can make the by far greatest impact on your portable air conditioner efficiency without even touching the air conditioner itself.\nAn air conditioner essentially extracts heat from your room and blows it outdoors. You use the air conditioner to cool down your room. But cooling a room becomes a really tedious (and inefficient) job for your portable air conditioner if heat enters the room through other ways.\nThat’s why you should always make sure that your room is well-insulated.\nYou can achieve the best insulation by having very thick walls.\nThe advantage of good insulation is that it is always just a one-off cost. And it will last a lifetime.\nHave you ever been to an old European castle with really thick walls? It’s always cool inside. Even without air conditioning.\nThe obvious disadvantage of good insulation is that it is potentially pricey. Also, you need to put in lots of work to renovate. If you can’t do it yourself, you have to hire an expert to do it for you.\nLuckily, you don’t have to refurbish your home in order to insulate your home well! Yes, good insulation helps a lot. But if this is out of your range of possibilities, even slight adjustments in your environment can have a significant impact on your portable air conditioner’s efficiency.\nYou can insulate your room in lots of different ways. Good insulation can be thick walls, walls with additional insulation, or insulated ceiling.\nEvery measure you take that prevents heat exchange with other rooms or outdoors helps.\nSimple insulation tips to improve air conditioning efficiency You likely don’t want to thicken your walls or add an extra insulation layer to your ceiling. If you can, then go ahead and do it!\nThis section is about a few simple things you can do that significantly help your AC’s efficiency.\nAlways keep the door closed You should always close the door to your room. With a closed door, your portable AC only has to cool one room at a time. With an open door, you would instead be cooling your entire apartment.\nBy closing the door you restrict the amount of air your portable air conditioner has to cool to only your room’s size.\nBlock airways below your door Also, you always want to prevent hot air from leaking into your room. Therefore you should make sure that the airways below your door are blocked.\nYou can use a bathroom towel or a rolled-up thin blanket and place it below your door.\nDon’t worry about oxygen. This does not cut you off fresh air. It only cuts off heat.\nYou can vent your room anytime.\nInstall windows that insulate well Heat can enter your room in two different ways. One is the movement of warm air into your room. By reducing the open airways into your room you can ensure that the least amount of hot air enters your room.\nThe other way that heat can enter your room is through-wall heat exchange.\nHeat does not have to be carried by a stream of air to get into your room. It can also penetrate your walls or your windows.\nTo have a well-insulated room, good multi-layered glass windows are essential. The most common modern windows consist of 3 thin layers of glass.\nEach gap between these glass layers traps a layer of air. The air acts as an insulator.\nIf you have 2 layers or even 1 layer windows, then I would suggest you upgrade them.\nHeat insulating windows help you not only in summer to maintain the portable air conditioner temperature but also in winter when you want to keep heat inside.\nReplace your old air conditioner with a new and efficient one Old portable air conditioners are often not as efficient as new ones. One reason is that the compressor (which constantly moves up and down) wears down over time and cannot move as smoothly as when it was new.\nAside from decreasing the cooling efficiency because parts don’t move as smoothly anymore, the increased internal friction and imbalance also cause your old portable air conditioner to be noisy.\nAdditionally, new portable air conditioners usually come equipped with the newest technologies and are sure to have higher energy efficiency.\nWhenever I look for major electric appliances to buy, such as dishwashers, washing machines, etc. I find that even 5 years difference to the model I have at home makes a big difference in energy efficiency.\nOf course, this does not mean you should buy a new portable AC every few years. This would not be worth it since the initial cost of buying is relatively high.\nBut I would estimate that buying a new portable air conditioner for the sake of lowering your electricity bill, reducing noise and better efficiency is worth it every 5-8 years.\nInsulate your air conditioner hose Another thing that will significantly improve your portable air conditioner efficiency is to insulate the air conditioner’s exhaust hose.\nKeep in mind the goal of your portable air conditioner is to cool your room. To cool your room, the AC extracts the heat energy from the air and blows the heat outdoors.\nThis means that the exhaust hose always contains hot air and therefore acts as a heating body inside your room. It is similar to having a small space heater on running while you actually want to cool your room.\nThe problem gets even worse if your air conditioner hose has leaks that allow the hot air to reenter your room. This would nullify the point of having a portable air conditioner running in the first place.\nAdditionally, the portable air conditioner fan, which pushes the hot air outdoors would have to blow harder in order to get the same amount of hot air outdoors as without leaks. This decreases efficiency.\nTherefore it is also crucial that parts that are connected to your AC’s hose such as the window insert and the hose connector have no gaps. The hose connections should be tight and bullet-proof.\nFor some people, the portable air conditioner hose sits loosely. I wrote an article on how to prevent the portable air conditioner hose from falling out here.\nUse HVAC tape to seal leaks To insulate your portable air conditioner hose you can wrap aluminum foil around it, which prevents the heat radiation from exiting the hose.\nAs an engineer, I am not really sure how much of a difference aluminum foil makes. It can help for sure. But the most important point is to ensure that there are no apparent leaks in your hose.\nIf there are any leaks, you can fix them with temperature-resistant HVAC tape (click here to view it on amazon). That’s a special kind of duct tape that can withstand higher temperatures without the glue melting.\nIt’s specially made for air conditioner use-cases.\nRegular tape might help as well but it is for sure not as durable and sticky as HVAC tape.\nAdditionally HVAC tape insulates and prevents any leakage of heat. If you want you can wrap the entire hose in HVAC tape.\nLower your air conditioner’s settings While portable air conditioners make your life comfortable by allowing you to portably cool your room, they can come with tradeoffs. Usually, a tradeoff is that they are not as powerful and efficient as fixed non-portable air conditioners.\nOne reason is that the exhaust hose of a portable air conditioner is much longer than that of a regular AC. The exhaust hose returns some heat to the room which we don’t want.\nAlso, lots of portable ACs come with only one hose. Actually, an AC needs two separate airways. One to suck in air from outdoors and one to blow hot air from your room out.\nPortable ACs that have only one hose have to suck in the cool air from indoors and blow it out. This is fatal to efficiency. But it helps with convenience.\nThat’s why most portable air conditioners can’t compete with fixed ACs when it comes to efficiency.\nTo not suck in too much cold air from your room and blow it outdoors, usually, it is better to run your portable AC on lower settings. With lower settings, I mean that you don’t cool as much and the fan is set to a moderate level.\nDon’t worry. Even on moderate settings, a portable air conditioner will get you through the high summer heat. As long as you don’t expect arctic cold you should be able to efficiently cool your room on moderate settings.\nConclusion The best way to make your portable air conditioner more efficient is to ensure that the exhaust hose is tightly connected and has no leaks.\nAlso, if you have an old portable AC, buying a newer model might be worth considering. Not only are newer models oftentimes more efficient, but you also get rid of noise and possibly the smell of your old AC.\nAlso, portable air conditioners run more efficiently on moderate settings. Don’t turn your room into a fridge.\nSince portable air conditioners oftentimes only have one hose they are not suited to cool your room to really low temperatures.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-make-portable-air-conditioner-more-efficient/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow to make a portable air conditioner more efficient?

What\u0026rsquo;s the best way to silence a noisy portable AC?\nI found lots of useless and ridiculous advice online, such as wrapping your portable AC in blankets. Not only do tips of this kind not work, but they are even dangerous.\nThis article deals with the few tips that will really get you a silent portable air conditioner. Just follow along.\nQuick answer: You can only make a portable air conditioner quieter by placing it on an anti-vibration pad and lowering the power settings. Soundproofing an AC is likely to overheat it and decreases the cooling efficiency. If your portable air conditioner is old (10 years or more), I would suggest you replace it. Modern air conditioners are significantly quieter.\nAfter this quick answer, let’s have a little deeper look. I will also link you all the products you need.\nHow to make a portable air conditioner quiet This section deals with the few methods that will result in you having a portable air conditioner that won’t disturb you noise-wise.\nBuy a new portable air conditioner First off, modern air conditioners are reasonably quiet. Of course, there is always some noise since the portable AC has a built-in compressor. But in comparison with old models (10 years or older), the new portable ACs are on a completely different level.\nIf the portable air conditioner you have at home is already old enough and you don’t want to waste your time worrying about and researching portable AC noise, then I recommend you just buy a new portable AC.\nBy simply upgrading to a more recent model, you lower the noise and also increase the energy efficiency.\nCompressors wear down over time. This causes old portable ACs to be louder. They aren’t as “balanced” anymore.\nPersonally, I recommend getting this SereneLife portable air conditioner with quiet mode (click here to view it on amazon).\nOne of the main advantages of simply buying a new portable air conditioner is that your result is instant. As soon as you replace your old AC with the new one, the noise problems are gone.\nAll you need to do is invest some money in the newer model.\nAnother advantage is energy efficiency. Old electric appliances are often loud because they are inefficient. Energy is wasted which oftentimes results in increased noise. In the end, the energy needed to produce the noise could be used to air condition your room.\nNew portable air conditioners are significantly more energy-efficient and can lead to hundreds of dollars in annual savings. By buying a new air conditioner, you make up for the initial cost after just 1-3 years.\nBuy a used “new” portable air conditioner If the upfront cost of a new portable air conditioner is too high for you and does not fit your budget, you can also buy it used.\nYou can find used portable air conditioners on craigslist, eBay, or maybe even at garage sales.\nOftentimes you get really nice deals from college students moving out of their student dorms. As they move into apartments, they don’t need their portable AC anymore and try to get rid of it.\nLower the cooling settings Another thing you can do to reduce your portable air conditioner noise is to lower the cooling settings. The lower the temperature you set on the AC’s thermostat, the more power the air conditioner has to use to compress the gaseous refrigerant.\nSince the compressor has to do more work in a given time, it tends to be louder. It’s just like stepping on the gas in a car. The engine just gets louder.\nAs a rule of thumb, noise increases with power usage. This is not only the case for portable air conditioners, but also for many space heaters, refrigerators, or fans.\nThe advantage of lowering the cooling power is that it works instantly and with any portable air conditioner. The age of your AC does not matter. And you don’t need to buy any extra gear.\nHowever, lowering the cooling power, as you probably already guessed, has a big drawback: Your portable air conditioner does not cool as much anymore.\nTherefore, lowering the cooling power is only an option when you don’t rely on your AC. This could be the case when the weather outside is not too hot.\nLowering the cooling power is not an option in the high summer heat.\nEven though this tip will produce immediate results, it is not a long-term solution. Purchasing a new up-to-date portable air conditioner is still the best long-term choice.\nPlace your portable AC on an anti-vibration pad Lots of noise travels through the floor and through walls. If you ever had an apartment neighbor drilling into a wall, you know how little soundproofing insulation many walls provide.\nPortable air conditioners vibrate when they are running. Otherwise, they would not be able to produce any noise. Noise is just vibrations in the air.\nWhen your portable air conditioner stands on the bare ground, the vibrations of your portable air conditioners travel through the floor and walls and you are able to hear them almost anywhere in your home.\nTo dampen these vibrations, anti-vibration pads will make a major difference! An anti-vibration pad is special padding that absorbs vibrations and thus reduces noise.\nAlso, they can prevent structural damages caused by the vibrations of your appliance.\nThis means that an anti-vibration pad not only reduces the noise to a moderate level, it can also increase the lifetime of your portable AC.\nWith an anti-vibration pad, you can continue using your portable air conditioner. There’s no need to replace, repair or modify your portable AC. Just stand your AC on top of the pad.\nAnti-vibration pads come in many different shapes and colors. Personally, I recommend this extra-thick anti-vibration pad(click here to view it on amazon).\nThe advantage of this product is that it’s generic. It does not fit only one product. In the long run, you can reuse this pad for all kinds of electric appliances including washing machines, audio equipment, or your personal home gym.\nPersonally, I like buying products that are of good quality and fit many different purposes. Likely, you won’t use your portable air conditioner for a lifetime. Once you stop using it, you can reuse the anti-vibration pad elsewhere.\nA product reviewer on Amazon writes:\n“It definitely works as a sound dampener. Vibration is cut down by at least 75%.”\nWear noise-canceling headphones Noise-canceling headphones are something that I want to mention as well. Not only do they enable you to reduce your portable air conditioner noise, but you can also cut any noise anywhere.\nEven though noise-canceling headphones do not solve the source of your noisy portable air conditioner problem, they are an invaluable tool to reduce noise whenever you need them.\nPersonally, I have used noise-canceling headphones in trains, on airplanes, and in libraries when studying. They are a game-changer.\nThey are especially useful when you need to block noises but you can’t do anything to fix the issue directly. For example, if your neighbor has a noisy portable AC.\nOne advantage of noise-canceling headphones is that they are cost-effective. You pay for them once and they will last you a long time. You don’t need to do any manual DIY work to fix the portable air conditioner noise. And you don’t need to be familiar with electronics. All you need to do is wear them.\nNoise-canceling headphones are a multi-purpose product. The main disadvantage, of course, is that they do not solve the source of the noise problem. And also noise-canceling headphones can only reduce the noise for one person at a time.\nAnother disadvantage is that you can’t really wear them while sleeping. So, if your portable air conditioner annoys you at night, you should go for a different solution.\nThe perfect scenario for using noise-canceling headphones is when you are working in an office that has a portable air conditioner. For up to 8 hours a day, you wear the (usually comfy) headphones that block out most of the noise.\nYou can’t really uninstall or replace the portable air conditioner since your colleagues want the air to be cool. But you can put the headphones on to block out the noise just for yourself.\nMy personal recommendation is the Bose Quiet Comfort noise-cancelling headphones (click here to view them on amazon).\nThey cancel noise much better than most competitor brands. I have tested them before. Personally, however, I am using a cheaper but still good alternative from a Chinese brand, because I was a poor student when I originally bought them. If the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones are too expensive for you as well, then just look up alternative products with decent customer ratings.\nTie a rope around the portable AC Another thing you can do is tie a rope around your portable air conditioner. While this sounds ridiculous at first, a rope can hold together the rattling parts of the portable air conditioner.\n\u0026ldquo;It is very likely that the noise is caused by the outside casing of the machine vibrating and the vibration can be severely lessened by literally tying a rope around the unit.\u0026rdquo;\nSpadesHeart on Reddit\nThis only works if your portable air conditioner has loose parts. A properly built and fairly new portable air conditioner is unlikely to rattle.\nSo, if your portable AC is either old or cheap, tightly tying a rope around it might help.\nHow not to make a portable air conditioner quiet There is a ton of dangerous misinformation online about soundproofing (portable) air conditioners.\nNow that we know what works, I will list you a few examples, so you know what doesn’t work and why it doesn’t work.\nLet’s have a look at a few of those common but probably impractical tips.\nWrap your portable air conditioner in a blanket Supposedly you can dampen the noise of a portable air conditioner by wrapping it in a big blanket. The blanket absorbs the noise. Right?\nAs a matter of fact, yes, the blanket absorbs a part of the noise. However, wrapping a portable air conditioner in a blanket is a bad idea.\nPortable air conditioners consume lots of power. The amount of power usage is even similar to that of an electric space heater. A part of that power ends up as residue heat.\nBy wrapping an AC in a blanket the entire air conditioner is more likely to overheat since the heat can not escape the device.\nAdditionally, because the internal electronics heat up, the resistances in the circuitry increase. This lowers the overall energy efficiency of your portable air conditioner and you will have to pay more on your electricity bill.\nAdditionally, when you wrap your portable air conditioner in a blanket, the risk of fire increases. This is especially the case with artificial fibers such as polyester or nylon.\nThese artificial fibers have a relatively low ignition temperature and catch fire quickly.\nA blanket can block the airways of your portable air conditioner. This forces it to suck in air harder than before which, in turn, causes an increase in energy consumption.\nSo, not only does the overheating of the portable AC decrease energy efficiency. The blocking of airways additionally prevents the efficient operation of the AC.\nWill wrapping your portable air conditioner help to lower the noise? Probably yes, but the risk of fire, the risk of damaging your portable AC through overheating and clogged airways, and the increased electricity bill make this tip not worthwhile.\nPlace the air conditioner on a carpet Some air conditioner blogs online write about how placing the portable air conditioner on a carpet reduces the noise.\nHere, I have to comment: Yes, it probably helps to reduce the amount of vibration traveling through the floor. But generally, to really soundproof something, a simple carpet is not sufficient.\nTo dampen vibrations you always need materials that are thick and can swallow a lot of energy. Mostly, that’s heavy materials.\nThat’s why thin walls never insulate noise well. You need more mass.\nSimilarly, a carpet is made of too light materials to have a real impact on the noise.\nInstead, a much better approach would be to use an anti-vibration pad.\nI am not saying that placing an air conditioner on the carpet doesn’t work. However, there are much better ways to soundproof your portable air conditioner.\nWhat makes a portable air conditioner so noisy? Now you have all the knowledge you need in order to silence your portable air conditioner. However, one question remains open. What actually makes your portable air conditioner so noisy?\nAnd why do the tips mentioned work although I don’t know what the cause of your AC noise is?\nOne of the main building blocks of a portable air conditioner is a refrigerant compressor.\nThe compressor constantly compresses a gaseous or fluid refrigerant. The compressed refrigerant medium then sucks the heat out of your room by expanding.\nThe heat energy in your room expands the refrigerant and therefore your room temperature reduces. I’ve never fully understood this concept until I took a university course on thermodynamics, so don’t worry if you don’t get it.\nThe important part is that there are always actively moving parts in a portable air conditioner.\nAnd these moving parts make noise through friction and rattling against each other.\nThe older your portable AC is, the noisier it tends to get.\nThere are two types of compressors: Scroll-type compressors are generally quieter than piston-type compressors.\nAnother source of noise could be loose parts in the portable AC case or internally.\nAll these noise-sources cause vibrations which you can dampen using an anti-vibration pad. You can fix rattling loose parts by tightly tying a rope around your portable AC. Alternatively, if you are familiar with electronics, you can open the case and try to fix the parts yourself.\nConclusion The best way to reduce portable air conditioner noise is by replacing your portable air conditioner with a newer one.\nOld portable air conditioners tend to be noisy because of compressor wear down or lose parts.\nAnother thing that always helps is getting an anti-vibration pad. An anti-vibration pad prevents the noise from traveling through the walls.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-make-a-portable-air-conditioner-quiet/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow to make a portable air conditioner quiet?

The connection of the exhaust hose and portable AC or between hose and window is not secure enough? How do you ensure your portable air conditioner hose stays in place?\nIn this article, we’re having a look at a few simple things you can do to prevent your air conditioner hose from falling out.\nA portable AC hose can fall out at either one of its ends: Either directly at the portable AC connection, or it can slip out from the window.\nQuick answer: You can fix your portable air conditioner and stop it from falling out by securing it with temperature and humidity-resistant HVAC duct tape. In the long run, getting the original exhaust hose of your portable air conditioner is the best choice, if it has connection pieces you can plug in without glue.\nWhy portable air conditioner hoses can fall out Portable air conditioner hoses can fall out. And that’s something very annoying. Normally, a portable AC only relies on fixed part connectors to connect the exhaust hose to the window.\nWith fixed part connectors I am referring to the plastic ends of the hose that you can connect to the window or the portable AC exhaust without the need for any glue.\nThese plastic connectors come with most portable air conditioners. As long as you set everything up correctly, the hose should not fall out.\nHowever, if the situation at your home is not a “standard situation”, connecting the hose might turn out troublesome.\nExamples of non-standard situations are:\nyour window sits at an elevated level you don’t have space right below your window so your portable AC has to stand at a further distance you want to protect your portable air conditioner from kids, so you place it on a high surface In all of these cases, you have to stretch the hose and might not be able to connect the hose without causing it to slip out.\nWhat most people do wrong when fixating the air conditioner hose Oftentimes people fix the portable air conditioner hose with common duct tape, which does not always work.\nThe problem is that the hose carries warm air outdoors. This means that the hose itself is heated up whenever the portable air conditioner runs.\nThe exhaust warmth causes the duct tape glue which attaches the hose and window or hose and portable AC to melt. The hose finally slips off.\nGood quality portable air conditioners come with hoses and built-in connectors that do not rely on friction or glue to hold together. Instead, they come with clever connection mechanisms to plug in the hose tightly. The mechanisms naturally keep the hose from falling out.\nHow to prevent your portable AC hose from falling out Now that we’ve discussed all the problems with air conditioner hoses and what causes them to fall out, let’s look at the steps you can take to ensure you don’t have to worry about your AC hose falling out anymore.\nUse HVAC duct tape to fixate your hose\nThe simplest fix is obviously to tape the hose to the air conditioner using duct tape. Here, you have to make sure that you use good quality duct tape which is suited for varying temperatures.\nThere exists so-called HVAC duct tape for extreme weather, humidities, and temperatures.\nPersonally, I recommend this professional-grade HVAC tape (click here to view it on amazon). This tape is very sticky, so you might need a friend to help you apply it. But it will be worth it and keep your portable air conditioner hose from falling out!\nUse original hose adapters Taping the hose using HVAC tape works perfectly fine. However, it oftentimes doesn’t look clean and is a “hack”.\nIf you want a clean-looking solution instead, the best way to fix your problem is to use the original hose adapter (transition piece) of your portable air conditioner.\nOf course, this only makes sense if your original hose adapters were working fine, but are broken. If the original connection parts of your portable AC don’t hold the hose firmly, it does not make sense to rebuy them.\nThe advantage of using original parts is that you don’t need extra gear such as HVAC tape or a hose kit. Also, no shortcut solution will hold the hose as reliably as the original parts (at least usually).\nThe original parts are designed and built to fit your portable air conditioner and hose exactly. Original parts are specific to each mode, which might make them hard to find.\nYou can look up your air conditioner brand’s online shop and see if they have replacement parts available. Usually, if you don’t find replacement parts online, the air conditioner companies are willing to help you and place a custom order just for you.\nSometimes, you can even get free replacements! But that’s probably only if you are lucky. It depends on the company you are contacting.\nBecause these replacement parts fit your portable air conditioner perfectly, you don’t need to use glue or tape. Everything should hold together on its own.\nUse an air conditioner hose kit If your original hose adapters (or other connection parts) are lost or broken and additionally you don’t find the original replacements online, you can use an air conditioner hose kit.\nAn air conditioner hose or window kit is a generic kit that comes with one-sized parts that should fit most portable air conditioners.\nHere’s a well-rated portable AC window kit (click here to view it on amazon) which you can use to set up a new window vent.\nAdditionally, if your hose is broken, you can get this air conditioner hose (click here to view it on amazon). Just make sure the diameter of 5.9 inches fits your portable AC.\nManufacturers oftentimes produce these hose kits cheaply. Most of the hose kits you find online are of low quality.\nYou will find a big difference in quality when you compare the original parts with the hose kit parts.\nOf course, there are exceptions. It is important to only buy highly-rated hose kits with hundreds or thousands of positive customer ratings. The portable AC window kit and the air conditioner hose are both well-rated and you can’t go wrong with them.\nSo, if the hose kits I have picked out are not suitable for your portable air conditioner (for example the hose diameter differs), then you should look for something with a similar rating.\nUse a bungee cord to hold up your hose Your portable air conditioner exhaust hose oftentimes falls out because the hose is pulling itself off because of its own weight.\nThis only happens if one end of the hose is significantly higher than the other end.\nYou can fix this by tying a bungee cord with both ends to your curtain rod. Alternatively, you can install two metal hooks on the wall on both sides of your window. You can then put the air conditioner hose on top of the bungee cord loop.\nThe bungee cord lifts the hose so a part of the “pull-off force” is distributed to the bungee cord instead of the air conditioner hose connection pieces.\nThis can make a significant difference and might even prevent your portable air conditioner hose from falling out.\nThe downside is that it looks rather “experimental”. But as long as you are using the portable air conditioner in a room that does not have visitors too often, or in a cabin, looks don’t matter.\nThere, holding up your air conditioner hose with a bungee cord may be a good, almost free, and glueless solution.\nAdvanced tips to secure your air conditioner hose Since we have already covered lots of ground on how to prevent your portable air conditioner hose from falling out, let’s have a look at a few more fine-grained details.\nFirst off, try to avoid stretching the hose too much. Portable air conditioner hoses should always sit loosely in the window and in the connector of the portable AC. There should never be any tensions and pull-off forces.\nIf you have to stretch your portable air conditioner hose because of length limits, try buying a new, longer hose. Alternatively, change the placement of your portable air conditioner. Hoses under tension will almost always fall out.\nAlso, always connect the hose to the lowermost part of the window. This reduces the length of the hose necessary to connect the window and AC. And also, using the lowermost part of your window for the exhaust connection ensures that the force pulling down the hose is minimized. The higher your exhaust connection is located, the greater the pull-off force.\nAccordingly, the hose should support as little of its own weight as possible. You can accomplish this by using a bungee cord to hold the hose up. It does not even have to be a bungee cord. Anything that prevents the hose from hanging in the air will prevent your portable air conditioner hose from falling out.\nConclusion The quickest and simplest solution to fix your portable air conditioner hose falling out is to duct tape it with HVAC tape.\nThis should solve 95% of the issues. If you still have problems with your hose slipping out, try to rebuy the original connection parts or a portable AC hose kit.\nEnsure that the hose does not have to support its own weight, so it doesn’t pull itself off.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/portable-air-conditioner-hose-falling-out/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour portable air conditioner hose keeps falling out?

In this article, we’re going to explore the art of using extension cords with portable ACs and how to stay safe at all times!\nExtension cords are one of the weak points when using portable ACs. Generally, portable ACs are very safe. However, they need lots of power.\nAnd when a weak extension cord has to handle too much power, it can melt or even catch fire.\nThat’s why you need the right-sized extension cord for your portable air conditioner.\nQuick answer: Yes, you can use an extension cord for a portable air conditioner. But make sure your extension cord supports the amperage of your portable AC. Otherwise, you risk a fire. Most portable AC units draw around 12 Amps of current. Your extension cord must be able to handle this.\nAre you not sure if your extension cord at home can handle it? Keep reading. I will recommend to you a few heavy-duty extension cords you can buy that can handle high amounts of current.\nRecommended Extension Cord for Portable Air Conditioners Before we dive too deep into what makes an extension cord safe to use for portable ACs, in this section I’ll link you my personal favorite extension cords.\nFor portable air conditioners, I recommend this POWTECH Heavy Duty extension cord (click here to view it on amazon). It supports up to 15 Amps and 1875 Watts of power, which makes it a perfect fit for high-current home appliances such as portable air conditioners. You can also use it with electric space heaters and other devices.\nPlease note that this extension cord has a length of 20 feet.\nIf you need any longer than that, I recommend you get this Clear Power high-quality 100 feet extension cord (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt’s a lot longer than the 20 feet extension cord. But it’s worth it. I guarantee you that you need such a long extension cord at least once every 5-10 years and each time you will regret not having one.\nFor such lengths I would not save money as long cords produce more heat and low-quality products will increase your energy bill as the electric resistance is too high\nPrerequisites for Extension Cords for Portal ACs Now that you know which extension cords you can use with a portable air conditioner, we can have a deeper look into what makes an extension cord safe to use.\nFirst and foremost: Not all extension cords are the same. Extension cords vary in gauge (thickness of the wire) and materials used. Different types of extension cords are best suited for different applications.\nFor usage with a portable AC, an extension cord must be rated to handle at least the amount of current the portable AC uses.\nUsually, it is best to leave some room for tolerance. If you have an appliance that uses 13 Amps of current, you should not settle for a 13A-rated extension cord. You don’t want to operate the extension cord at its very limit all the time. A slight power spike can overload the extension cord wires and cause a meltdown.\nAlways use an extension cord that can handle your appliance for sure. For 5A devices, use a 7A extension cord. For 10A devices, use a 12A extension cord. And so on.\nThe underlying philosophy is going the safe route because risks and benefits aren’t balanced. When you use a cheap extension cord, the biggest benefit is that you save a few bucks. But the risk is that your house burns down.\nRisks and benefits are not balanced. Get a solid high-gauge extension cord, such as the ones I recommended earlier.\nHow much current do Portable ACs use? Portable ACs need different amounts of power. This depends on how much “cooling power” a portable air conditioner provides and also on how efficient it is.\nThere are portable ACs that use anywhere from 1000W up to 1500W.\nOn average, a portable AC uses 11.6 Amps, which usually corresponds to 1300W of power.\nThe low-power portable ACs draw 9.5A of current, while high-power ACs draw up to 14A of current.\nHowever, these numbers are not representative at all times. A portable AC can draw 9A at one moment and 14A at the next. This depends on how the thermostat in the portable AC is working.\nAlso, even though some portable ACs are rated for lower currents, they can surpass these limits. If a portable AC has no sufficient safety mechanisms built-in, nothing prevents it from drawing more current than what is listed in the technical user manual.\nMany homeowners experience this phenomenon. One writes\n“This unit is supposed to draw a maximum of 9.5 amps, and it would be a little below that when it was first turned on, but then it would gradually pull more and more, getting up into the 13-14 amp range.”\nA customer rating a popular portable AC online\nBecause of these varying currents, I highly suggest you to be cautious when choosing the right extension cord.\nTheoretically and according to the user manual of the aircon, you could grab cheaper 13A extension cords as they fit the current ratings.\nI would, instead, suggest the following:\n“Always use an extension cord rated at 15A or higher for portable air conditioners.”\nAdditional safety tips for using an extension cord with a Portable AC When using an extension cord with a portable AC, you have to always have safety in mind. It is not enough to just buy a proper gauge extension cord that can handle the required amount of current.\nSafety incidents can happen even with very good extension cords. Although they happen very infrequently as compared to when you use cheap extension cords, you should still consider the following safety tips.\nUnroll the extension cord so heat does not build up Portable ACs draw a lot of current. Depending on the extension cord you use, more or less heat builds up in the wire, because of the current flowing through it.\nThe higher gauge your extension cord is (high gauge = thick cable), the cooler your extension cord stays. The reason is that the current has more room to move freely. In technical terms, you can say that high gauge extension cords have less resistance per length.\nWhen you keep the extension cord rolled up while you power a portable AC, it becomes more likely to overheat. Therefore, just make sure that your extension cord is not bundled up tightly, but it sits loosely on the ground.\nIdeally, you should leave your extension cord loose while still being straightened out.\nHaving a proper-length extension cord for your specific use case helps.\nProperly connect extension cord with the wall outlet Make sure you connect your extension cord firmly with the portable air conditioner as well as with the wall outlet. A tight connection is important for safety as it reduces resistance.\nWhen your extension cord is only loosely connected to the wall outlet or the portable AC, the electric current has to surpass a bigger resistance. The current is forced through the few “touching points” of the extension cord and wall outlet.\nIn loose connections, heat builds up because a lot of energy passes through a tight contact area.\nHere, it doesn’t even matter if you have a cheap or an expensive extension cord. When the connection of the extension cord to the appliance or to the wall outlet is weak, heat always builds up.\nEven expensive high-quality extension cords can cause a meltdown or even a fire.\nChoose the right length Your extension cord should be about the length that you need to connect the wall outlet and portable AC. It should not be much longer.\nThe longer the cord the greater the resistance it has. This causes a greater heat up in the cable as well as increased power usage.\nThe increased power usage stems from the fact that portable ACs (or any electric appliances in general) always try to draw a fixed amount of power. If the current faces a bigger resistance because of a longer extension cord, energy is lost in the extension cord. The portable AC then draws more power from the wall outlet to make up for the lost part.\nThis means: longer cables heat up more, produce more waste heat, and increase your energy bill.\nCan you use a regular extension cord with a portable air conditioner? Not always, but sometimes a regular extension cord you already have at home is suitable for your portable AC as well. It all depends on the quality of the extension cord and its power and current limitations.\nYou have to ensure that your extension cord is rated at a higher level of Amps than what your portable air conditioner requires. You can oftentimes find the Amperage rating of your extension cord printed on the cable itself.\nI would advise staying away from extension cords rated below 13A, because, as we saw earlier, portable air conditioners can unexpectedly spike in current.\nLots of extension cords are rated for 8A or 12A devices. These extension cords are cheap to get and are more common than the high-gauge ones. They might even work for some time.\nBut eventually, these extension cords will fail and cause some kind of problem of medium to high severity, such as a blown fuse, a meltdown, or a fire in the worst case.\nThe problem with these “regular” low current extension cords is that they are too thin to handle large amounts of electric current. Their resistance is too high and causes heat to build up.\nThe low-quality materials used in producing these cheap extension cords will fail quickly when you use them with portable air conditioners.\nExtra safe extension cords If you are a risk-averse person, then going for a good quality extension cord is already a good choice. But if you want to be absolutely sure that you minimize the chance of an accident, you can get an even higher gauge extension cord.\n30A extension cords for high current outdoor appliances could be your choice in this case. Usually, you would use these extension cords to connect high current appliances from distant power outlets. The resistance of these high gauge wires is small, which improves the energy efficiency of your portable air conditioner.\nOne example is this 30A extension cord (click here to view it on amazon).\nSuch an extension cord is not really necessary.

Space heater fires are in the news regularly. And still, space heaters don’t decline in popularity. The opposite is the case: More and more people see the advantages of space heaters and choose to buy one.\nBut with all the space heater accidents in the back of your mind, you wonder how much you can trust such a space heater.\nIn this article, we will declare the safest space heater model available. This article will be updated whenever a better model becomes available.\nQuick answer: Oil-filled radiators are the safest space heaters. Currently, the safest space heater model available is the DeLonghi oil-filled radiator. DeLonghi oil-filled radiators have good build quality as well as many safety features such as a built-in thermostat, overheat protection, and tip-over protection.\nBut before you go ahead and buy just any DeLonghi oil-filled radiator, let’s have a look at the exact model we crown as our favorite!\nSafest Space Heater: My Top Pick The winner of our safest space heater award is the DeLonghi TRD40615EBK oil-filled radiator (click here to view it on amazon).\nIt stands out from all the other space heaters for 3 reasons:\nFirst off, it is an oil-filled radiator-type heater. Oil-filled radiators are generally a lot safer than any other heater type, such as infrared, propane, or ceramic heaters.\nThe heater is made of high-quality materials. Generally, DeLonghi is known to produce superior quality products.\nThe DeLonghi TRD40615EBK provides all the safety features you can think of. It is 24h programmable, has a built-in thermostat. It comes with tip-over protection and, of course, overheat protection. All these safety features combined result in a very safe heater.\nBut that is not the only advantage this oil-filled radiator has. In comparison, most of these safety features can also be found in Pelonis or other brands’ heaters.\nWhat makes the DeLonghi especially safe is its design. Regular oil-filled heaters have this classic recognizable chimney design. The heater body consists of several chimney towers, which usually have sharp edges.\nThe DeLonghi TRD40615EBK has a clever design where these sharp edges are not exposed to the outside surface. Instead, its surface is made of almost perfectly flat chimneys.\nThis additionally ensures that nobody can hurt himself on the heaters’ surface. For example, you can’t hit your knee or a kid can’t dangerously damage its head on the heater.\nThe surface design is intrinsically safe as no sharp corners are exposed.\nThis makes the DeLonghi TRD40615EBK the safest space heater available.\nWhy you might not need the absolute safest space heater The DeLonghi oil-filled radiator I presented earlier is the safest space heater out there. But actually, you don’t really need the safest space heater if you don’t have kids or pets.\nWhy? Even basic oil-filled radiators such as this Pelonis oil-filled radiator (click here to view my favorite oil-filled radiator) have all the required safety features.\nThey come with overheat protection, tip-over protection, and a built-in thermostat. The only thing that separates the expensive DeLonghi heater from the affordable Pelonis model is the safe surface design.\nThe classic chimney design of most oil-filled radiators is not a safety issue for adults. Only children or pets can hurt themselves on the sharp corners.\nThat’s what makes the DeLonghi oil-filled radiator the safest space heater.\nIf you don’t have pets or kids at home, you don’t really need it and you can go for the affordable Pelonis heater.\n“All common oil-filled radiators provide great safety features. Without kids or pets at home, just buy an affordable oil-filled radiator with overheat protection, tip-over protection, and a built-in thermostat.”\nWhich Space Heater Type is the Safest? Now that you know the absolute safest space heater available, you can already stop reading and go ahead and buy the winning heater.\nHowever, you might also want to know what type of space heaters are generally safer than others.\nIn the following sections, we’ll explore, what makes an oil-filled radiator the generally safest type of space heater. And also, what makes infrared heaters, propane heaters, and ceramic heaters generally a little more dangerous.\nAlso, you’ll see why you might not need to buy the safest heater available and how you can save some money.\nWhat makes an oil-filled radiator the safest space heater? Oil-filled radiators are the safest space heaters. And it’s pretty simple to explain why.\nAs compared to other space heater types, oil-filled radiators are the least likely to cause a fire.\nTo cause a fire, a heater must be able to ignite something. This means there must be some part of it that gets very hot. This is the case for infrared heaters, for example, where the heating elements are exposed and glow red hot. Whenever an easily ignitable object gets too close to the exposed heating element, it is prone to catching flames.\n1. Oil-filled radiators distribute heat safely An oil-filled radiator is extremely unlikely to cause a fire. The reason is that the heating element of an oil-filled radiator is embedded in the big metal heating body. It is impossible to access the heating element without breaking the whole heater up.\nInside the oil-filled radiator, the heating element is fully embedded in oil. The oil absorbs the heat from the electric heating element and transports it to the big metal surface, which consists of many chimneys which increase the surface area.\nBecause an oil-filled radiator distributes the heat across the whole metal surface, there is no single hot point that can ignite stuff. Rather, an oil-filled radiator has a big hot surface. The surface gets hot enough to be uncomfortable to hold your hand against for too long, but it is not hot enough to burn anything.\nThe distribution of heat ensures minimal risk of fire and optimal heat exchange with the air in your room.\n2. Oil-filled heaters produce the same amount of heat as other heaters Here’s a common misunderstanding: Many people think that since the heat is distributed across a big surface, oil-filled radiators can’t produce as much heat as other heaters. That is plain and simple wrong.\nOil-filled radiators produce the same amount of heat as any other heater type. The heat is just distributed better. As long as your heater draws 1500W of power, you get 1500W of heat.\nThere is no difference in the amount of heat produced between different heaters.\n3. The oil makes oil-filled radiators safe Oil-filled radiators use oil to distribute the heat from the internal heating element to the metal heating surface.\nBut why aren’t these heaters filled with water? The answer to this question is also safety.\nThe metal heating body is fully enclosed. Imagine you fill it with water. You turn the heater on and the heating element starts getting hot.\nSince it reaches high temperatures quickly, the water tries to evaporate. However, since the metal heating body is fully enclosed, there is no space for water evaporation. This means the pressure inside the steel body would quickly increase until the heater explodes.\nWe don’t use water as a heat transport fluid because it has a low evaporation temperature and it would turn the space heater into a bomb.\nContrasting that, oil has a high evaporation temperature. That’s why oil inside an oil-filled radiator does not expand much and doesn’t cause pressure to build up.\nThe oil protects the heater from exploding.\n4. Oil-filled radiators distribute heat without moving parts Many different electric space heaters rely on built-in fans to distribute heat.\nWhile these built-in fans might be helpful in many cases, they can be a safety issue in the wrong environments.\nIf you have kids or pets at home, exposed moving parts such as built-in fans can be unsafe. Kids could cut their fingers. Cats could hurt their paws. Or birds could hurt their wings and rip out some feathers.\nMoving parts are only safe as long as you have nobody to misuse them. In some Dyson space heater safety instructions, I found a note that you shouldn’t spray air freshener into the built-in fan.\nSomewhere in the world, someone at least once sprayed air freshener into a space heater fan and caused a fire. Otherwise, this note wouldn’t be in Dyson’s safety manual.\nSome people might misunderstand a space heater for a fan, because of the design.\nThis can cause accidents.\nBy getting a space heater without a built-in fan, such as an oil-filled radiator, you ensure maximum safety and you avoid unnecessary accidents.\nI know that some of these examples sound ridiculous. But they have happened somewhere in the world already. And you don’t want them to happen at your home.\nHow safe are oil-filled radiators? Now that we know why oil-filled radiators are the safest type of space heater, let’s find out how safe they really are.\nOil-filled radiators are safe to run 24/7. Since they don’t have a single point source of heat, but rather a big hot surface. Also, oil-filled radiators don’t have any built-in moving parts.\nBecause of the uniformly distributed heat and the lack of moving parts, there is nothing that wears down an oil-filled radiator while it’s heating.\nAlso, since there is no wear down, it is highly unlikely for an oil-filled radiator to have any accidents while it’s running. Most accidents are human errors.\nAn oil-filled radiator is only as safe as the person using it.\nYou should, for example, never leave your home while an oil-filled radiator is running.\nAlso, you should ensure that there are no easily ignitable objects near the space heater. Even though oil-filled radiators don’t have high surface temperatures, you should ensure that you don’t produce avoidable risks.\nHandle your oil-filled radiator responsibly and you can be sure you’ll have a safe companion for the next years.\nJust recently, at my place, we discarded our 30-year-old electric oil-filled radiator. It never caused us any trouble and ran reliably to the very end.\nWhat Makes a Space Heater Unsafe? Other space heater types are not as safe as oil-filled radiators. Of course, there are exceptions. Some infrared heaters, such as the Dr. Infrared Heater (click here to view it on amazon) are very well designed and built to meet the highest safety standards.\nAnd some oil-filled radiators might not be as reliable as the DeLonghi model I recommended in a previous section.\nBut generally, you can say that oil-filled radiators are safer than other heater types.\nLet’s see why.\nWhy infrared heaters are not the safest space heaters Infrared heaters, for example, can’t be the safest type of space heaters. Don’t get me wrong: Infrared heaters are awesome and have incredible heating efficiency. I have an infrared heater myself.\nBut when it comes to safety, they don’t compare to oil-filled radiators.\nInfrared heaters produce heat using infrared radiation. The infrared radiation does not heat the air itself, but the objects it shines on. Infrared heaters heat up objects. This means that infrared heaters have the capability to heat objects at a greater distance as long as they are in the line of sight.\nWhen you have an ignitable or explosive at home and your infrared heater radiates at it, it can potentially cause an accident.\nThis, of course, happens only rarely. What makes infrared heaters really unsafe as compared to oil-filled radiators is the heat source.\nThe heating element of an oil-filled radiator is almost always exposed and only protected by a metal grid. The metal grid itself gets very hot when the heater is running.\nSo, children or pets are likely to burn themselves on infrared heaters. There are some images of cat furs starting to smoke from infrared heaters.\nWhy regular electric space heaters are not the safest space heaters The “regular” electric space heaters you can buy for cheap at Walmart or Home Depot are not the safest type of space heaters.\nHere, the quality determines the safety of the product. Oftentimes these electric space heaters are advertised as being made of fireproof materials. However, reality shows something different.\nWhen I see a picture of a burning space heater online, it’s almost always the cheap kind of electric space heater.\nEither the case of the space heater is molten, or the power cord, or the wall outlet.\nOftentimes, these heaters don’t have reliable electric power control. Variations in resistances and capacities in the electronics of the space heater then cause the heater to draw too much power from the wall outlet.\nThen the weakest part of the space heater melts.\nWith an oil-filled radiator, such a scenario can’t happen. First and foremost, oil-filled radiators produce the heat from within an oil-filled heating body. It’s impossible to melt the metal using just the power from the wall outlet.\nThe wall outlet itself also is better protected since oil-filled radiators mostly have a built-in thermostat that controls the amount of power to be drawn from the outlet. However, to be fair, that’s not the case for all oil-filled radiators. Especially old oil-filled radiators can have the same issue.\nWhy propane heaters are not the safest space heaters A similar case can be made for propane heaters. Propane heaters are different from regular electric space heaters in their source of power. Propane heaters use propane gas as a fuel to produce heat. There are also other kinds of gas or fuel-based heaters.\nThe main difference in safety as compared to an oil-filled radiator or an electric space heater is the lack of a built-in thermostat.\nA thermostat is an electric control unit that controls the amount of heat the space heater produces in order to reach the target temperature. Propane heaters don’t have such a built-in thermostat, because thermostats are electronic devices.\nThe only way to regulate the heat output of a propane heater is to limit the gas inflow using a knob.\nStill, propane heaters are safe. They oftentimes also have tip-over protection.\nAnother downside of propane heaters is their high surface temperature. Propane heaters can easily ignite stuff. Essentially, propane heaters produce small flames. These small flames can cause a fire if you misuse the propane heater.\nHowever, because of the lack of advanced safety features and the high surface temperatures, propane heaters are not the safest heaters.\nConclusion Oil-filled radiators are the safest type of space heaters. They have an inherently safe design, where the heat is distributed from a fully protected heating element to a large surface area that exchanges the heat with the air.\nAdditionally, oil-filled radiators oftentimes have built-in thermostats and all the other necessary and useful safety features such as tip-over and overheat protection.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/what-is-the-safest-space-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhat is the safest space heater?

How many Watts do you need? Most guides online, when googling for this question, give you formulas to calculate the needed wattage based on the size of your room.\nBut that is an over-complication of the approach to solving the question and an oversimplification of the real world. A simple formula can’t consider all boundary conditions in your home: What’s the exact volume of your living space? How well insulated is your home? How moist is the air? What kind of furniture do you have? What’s the weather like outside? Are doors kept open or closed?\nI could think of a thousand such questions. Since we can’t consider all these questions in a formula (you’d probably need to hire a research team), we need another way to properly size space heaters.\nLuckily, there is a much more practical and stupid simple approach to sizing space heaters and it will always work out perfectly.\nNo mathematics or formula required. Just real-life knowledge and a little bit of testing.\nQuick answer: You need one 1,500W space heater with a built-in thermostat. The thermostat automatically adapts the wattage to the room size and always draws the exact amount of power needed to keep your room at temperature.\nLater, I will show you my favorite 1,500W heater with a thermostat, so you don’t have to do the research.\nIn this article, we’re first at some formulas and some pre-made calculations for you. Since that is too complicated, I am explaining to you later on, why any 1,500W space heater with a thermostat is already a perfect choice.\nHow to size a space heater by formula The first approach to properly size a space heater for your room is by formula.\nFirst, you need to measure the size of your room. That’s best done using a folding ruler.\nMeasure two sides of your room and multiply them with each other to get the area of your room.\nIf you have a pitched roof within your room, you can decrease the area under the pitched roof by 50%. This is not mathematically exact, since we don’t know the inclination and height of the pitched roof. But for most homes, this will work out.\nOnce you know the size of your room, you can continue with the following formula.\nHow many Watts of power does your space heater need? In this section, we’ll develop a formula based on a mix of an existing formula and personal experience. So, for your calculation use the last formula in this section.\nIf you are interested in how we adapt existing formulas, then keep reading.\nHere’s one existing formula I found:\n“Estimate 10 watts per square foot and multiply the square footage of the room by 10. A room with 144 square feet will require 1,440 watts.”\noverstock.com\nThe formula from the quote above is surprisingly simple. Just multiply the square footage by 10.\nI will add some value here: If you measured your room size in square meters, then the factor of 10 should be replaced with a factor of 100. The formula for square meters is:\n“Estimate 100 watts per square meter and multiply the square meters of the room by 100. A room with 15 square meters will require 1500 watts.”\nThis formula is a good starting point. However, I think it is too strict. I have a 2000W oil-filled radiator at home, and it can easily heat 300 square feet rooms. According to the formula, it would be best suited for 200 square feet rooms.\nSo, I’d suggest to adapt the calculation. My personal formula is:\n“Measure the square footage of your room and multiply it by 6.67. The result is the amount of Watts a space heater needs to heat your room. If you measured your room in square meters, multiply the area by 66.7.”\nSpace heater sizes for different room sizes pre-calculated Here I have already calculated some wattages for you, so you don’t need to. If you are looking for an electric space heater, the power is rated in Watts. The formula is a simple division by 6.67, as we saw in the previous section.\nWatt table\nHeater power in Watts****Room size in square feet500747501121,0001501,5002252,000300Different wattages and the room sizes they are able to heat\nIf your room is bigger than 300 square feet, then you should just get multiple space heaters. It is very hard to find home space heaters rated over 2000W in the US. In Europe, there are some, but it is generally not common.\nSpace heaters stronger than 2000W are usually industrial heaters.\nIf you plan to use a non-electric heater such as a propane heater, the following table is for you. Fuel and gas-based heaters don’t specify their power in Watts but in BTU.\nHere’s how many BTUs you need to heat various room sizes.\nHeater power in BTURoom size in square feet4,0001306,00020010,00033015,00050020,000660Different BTU ratings and the room sizes they are able to heat (source: pickhvac.com)\nWhich space heater sizes are available? If you went for the calculation approach, you should by now know how many Watts your space heater needs.\nBut still, what should you do now? For example, if you have a 200 square feet room, you know by multiplying the area by 6.67 that you need a 1,334W space heater.\nHowever, 1,334W space heaters don’t exist. So, another question comes up: What should you do now? Do you pick a bigger or a smaller space heater? And will you waste energy by going for the bigger space heater?\nThe answer is absurdly simple. It doesn’t really matter which space heater size you need. Almost all common space heaters are rated at 1,500W. That’s the size you get.\nThe result of your calculation does not matter.\nSome space heaters are 750W. But we are not talking about those. They are too small for most use cases. When you buy a 750W heater, you restrict yourself to small room usage. Let’s ignore the 750W heaters for now.\nThe practical approach to space heater sizing There is a much better approach to finding the perfect-sized space heater. And it is the following:\nBuy a 1,500W heater. Here’s my personal favorite 1,500W heater with thermostat (click to see the review).\nSince 1,500W are your only real option, buying 1,500W heaters is what you should do. You can just as well use a 1,500W heater for a small room, even if you calculated you only need, say, 700W of power.\nLet me explain in the following section why a 1,500W heater is perfectly suited for almost any room size.\nThe magic of thermostats: Wattage doesn’t matter The power (wattage) of a space heater describes how much heat the space heater can output at most.\nBut this maximum amount of power is not always used.\nLots of space heaters come with a built-in thermostat. A thermostat controls the amount of heat your space heater outputs.\nOn the thermostat, you set the desired room temperature. Your space heater will then heat your room to that temperature.\nNow comes the magic: Once the desired temperature is reached, the space heater turns off the heat. This means that a 1,500W space heater with a built-in thermostat will never overheat your room, regardless of the size.\nWhen you have a small room and the 1,500W heater is supposedly (according to the mathematical formula in the previous sections) too big for you, the 1,500W heater, thanks to the thermostat, automatically reduces the power it uses.\nA space heater with a thermostat automatically adapts its wattage to the room size.\nThe power rating (1,500W) of a space heater with a thermostat does not describe how much power the space heater uses at all times. It describes the maximum power usage of the space heater.\nHow to size a space heater without formula There is a simple rule you can follow to properly size a space heater without doing any calculations.\nBuy a 1,500W space heater with a built-in thermostat Spend one day heating your room with it. Is it warm enough? If yes, you have properly sized your space heater. If the space heater does not provide enough heat, that means 1,500W is too little power for you. Supplement with central heating. It’s that easy.\nWhen you have two heat sources (electric space heater + central heating or a stove) in one room, the space heater will not overheat your room thanks to its thermostat.\nThe space heater will adapt itself to the other heat source and only produce the necessary heat to keep your room at the desired temperature.\nThe space heater lowers its heat output and generates the exact amount of wattage that your room needs. You don’t need to pick the space heater size. A space heater picks its own size by automatically adapting to its surroundings.\nHow to choose space heaters for big rooms Now, what if your room needs 2,500W of power? Well, it doesn’t matter that you need a 2,500W space heater since you won’t find space heaters rated this high anyways. Personally, I have never seen a regular household space heater rated at 2,500W.\nAdditionally, most American wall outlets and electric home circuits are limited to 1,800W and 15A. A space heater using 1,500W draws about 12.5A already maxes out what your home circuit can handle.\nFor big rooms, you can try to use two 1,500W space heaters, if the room is big enough to have multiple separate electric circuits.\nHowever, generally, if a 1,500W heater is not enough for your room, then you should use central heating.\nSpace heaters will save you money only if you use them in smaller spaces. When your room requires this much heating power, you may as well use central heating. Normally, the price for central heating is cheaper than electricity.\nSpace heaters only have an advantage in smaller spaces, where you can decrease the central heating temperature and use a space heater to supplement heat where you need it.\nAlso, using central heating with an additional space heater is a much safer route to go, since the central heating does not demand your electric circuit.\nConclusion To properly size a space heater, you can either use one of the formulas given or just look up the pre-calculated results from the table above.\nBoth of these approaches require you to know the size of your room. Since this is not always the case, I suggest another approach.\nBuy a 1,500W space heater with a built-in thermostat. The thermostat ensures that your space heater only produces the required amount of heat. By keeping your room at the target temperature, your space heater automatically adapts its wattage to your room size and insulation.\nIf you notice that 1,500W is not enough for your room, you should supplement the space heater with your central heating or vice versa. If you don’t have central heating available, you can also install a stove.\nOperating more than one space heater in a single room is not safe since the space heaters will overload your home circuit’s amperage and wattage limitations. This can cause fuses to trip and in the worst case, a fire.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/which-space-heater-size-do-you-need/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhich space heater size do you need?

In this article, we’re looking at wood stove fans, what they are, how they work, and whether you should get one. Also, we’re clearing up some common misconceptions. So let’s jump right in!\nQuick answer: Wood stove fans are worth it, but only for smaller rooms. They will help distribute the hot air a little but are more of a toy and nice to look at as a design item. If you seriously have to distribute heat in your home, you should use an electric floor fan. Floor fans are very powerful and are able to quickly move large amounts of air between and within rooms.\nWhat is a wood stove fan? A wood stove fan is a gadget you can place on a hot wood stove to blow the hot air in any direction you want. Normally, wood stoves radiate heat in two ways:\ninfrared heat radiation hot air rising (convection) Both of these forms of heat combined make the comfortable feeling of wood stove warmth. The infrared heat radiation is the kind of heat you feel when the sun shines on you, or when you are sitting in front of a campfire. While the air itself is cold, the heat radiation makes you feel warm.\nWhat makes you feel really comfortable at home is, however, not just the heat radiation, but also warm air. Your room temperature has to be at a certain level so you feel comfy at home.\nNow, because the hot air from your stove always rises to the ceiling, the heat distribution in your room is unbalanced. While the floor is cold, the ceiling is warm.\nWood stove fans attempt to solve this problem of heat distribution. Wood stove fans blow the hot air into your room, so it doesn’t just rise straight up.\nWith a wood stove fan, you can control where the heat of your stove is going.\nWood stove fans are available in different colors and different designs.\nBut more importantly: Most wood stove fans don’t use any electricity. They are purely powered by the heat from your wood stove.\nThere are also electrically powered wood stove fans. These are capable to push more air, but produce noise and are not as magical to look at.\nAre wood stove fans worth it? Now that we know what a wood stove is, let’s have another short look at the promises of one.\nIn the following sections, we will see whether these promises hold. And if a wood stove fan is really worth it.\nThe hot air of a wood stove always rises to the ceiling. A wood stove fan catches some of the heat and uses it to blow the hot air into the room. This way it keeps the warmth down for a longer time. This helps with increasing the room temperature in the lower air layers of your room.\nYou can place a wood stove fan however you want, so it blows the air in any direction you desire. You have full control over where the wood stove fan blows the warm air.\nThe non-electrical heat-powered version of wood stove fans does not produce any noise and is nice to look at.\nDownsides of wood stove fans At a first glance, a wood stove fan seems like a nice gadget to have. Actually, it’s true. It helps to distribute the heat a little and looks beautiful. If that’s all you need, go ahead and buy one.\nHowever, not everything is perfect about wood stove fans. Let’s have a look.\nThe first thing that’s apparent when looking at a wood stove fan is that they are bare-metal products and have no safety features. There is no guard that protects fingers from spinning blades.\nIf you have kids at home, the spinning blades could be dangerous and cause cuts. I don’t think wood stove fans are strong enough to cut a finger off since they are merely heat-powered. But I believe it’s enough for a small injury, a crying kid, and a ruined evening.\nAlso, the spinning blades could be problematic with pets. I can think of pets trying to play with the wood stove fan.\nGenerally, though, the safety risks of a wood stove fan are negligible. The much bigger danger is, of course, the burning hot wood stove itself. There is a much higher risk of your kid or pet burning himself on the hot wood stove surface.\nAlso, kids are oftentimes not big enough anyways to reach for a wood stove fan on top of a wood stove. But this depends on the dimensions of your wood stove.\nAre wood stove fans efficient? Wood stove fans that are powered by heat only have to convert some of the heat energy that rises from your stove to kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is responsible for the rotational movement of the fan blades.\nSince at all times the wood stove fan blades are spinning, a part of the heat energy is always retained to power the spinning blades. This means, your wood stove will actually heat less than without a fan on top of it. The fan consumes some of the heat energy, which results in kinetic energy, which then, in turn, is only converted back to heat through friction. The fan, therefore, retains some heat.\nHowever, that is only a very minor effect and surely not noticeable. The conversion of heat energy to kinetic energy is very inefficient. If the wood stove fan would draw considerable amounts of energy from your wood stove, the fan blades would spin like a jet engine and your wood stove would not produce heat anymore.\nSo, in terms of physical energy efficiency, a wood stove fan actually decreases the efficiency of your wood stove a tiny bit by withholding some of the heat as kinetic energy.\nBut that effect is unnoticable.\nKeep on reading. Later we will see how wood stove fans still increase the perceived energy efficiency of your wood stove.\nDo wood stove fans really work? I’ve seen some sources online write things like “If you want to increase the efficiency of your stove, get a wood stove fan”.\nHowever, that is plain false information.\nWood stove fans do not increase the efficiency of a wood stove. We can view the efficiency of a wood stove as the room temperature your stove produces in comparison with the amount of wood you put into it. In actual physics terms, it should be output energy divided by input energy.\nBut room temperature produced per wood inserted is easier to think about. And both room temperature and the wood inserted are closely related to output and input energies.\nBy placing a wood stove fan on top of a wood stove, your wood stove does not produce higher average room temperatures.\nTherefore, a wood stove fan does not improve the efficiency of your wood stove.\nWood stove fans, however, blow the hot air in your direction. Because the warm air is directed where you need it, the perceived temperature increases.\nSo, we can conclude that the perceived efficiency of a wood stove indeed increases when you place a wood stove fan on it.\nAnd perceived efficiency is all that matters. The human body only cares about wellbeing. It does not matter whether the physical efficiency increases. All that matters is how warm you feel.\nYes, wood stove fans work and increase the perceived efficiency of your wood stove.\nHow strong are heat powered wood stove fans? A wood stove fan only distributes the heat a little.\nIn the video below, the channel “Stands Out” compares the cubic-feet-per-minute (CFM) ratings of different wood stove fans.\n\u0026amp;ab_channel=StandsOut\nThe result of the experiment is that most wood stove fans push 75 to 125 CFM of air. That’s not a lot. Later, we’ll see a better alternative to wood stove fans with a CFM rating of 4650!\nHeat-powered wood stove fans work through the conversion of heat energy to kinetic energy, which spins the blades. The spinning blades then push the rising hot air forward.\nBecause the conversion of heat to kinetic energy is generally very inefficient, the fan blades rotate only weakly.\nA wood stove fan will cause just a slight change in the distribution of heat in your room. It is not able to push significant amounts of heat over longer distances.\nWhat is a better alternative to wood stove fans? What is the best alternative to wood stove fans? We’ve just seen that wood stove fans don’t work perfectly. Mostly, because they work without an additional power source. Wood stove fans convert heat energy to kinetic (movement) energy, which is generally an inefficient process. Therefore, the wood stove fan blades rotate only weakly and are not able to push any significant amounts of air.\nMost wood stove fans have a cubic feet per minute (CFM) rating of 75 to 125.\nTo be able to really distribute the heat evenly in your home, a wood stove fan is not sufficient.\nElectrically powered wood stove fans can output much more air and are much stronger. However, even the electrically powered wood stove fans are not perfect, as they are suited for just one use case: blowing air from a stovetop.\nWhy you should get an electric floor fan instead If you want to have a real powerful solution to distribute hot air from your stove around your home, you should get a floor fan.\nStrong floor fans are the single best tool to push air around your house. They come in different sizes, shapes and colors, so you can always find one you like.\nFloor fans are capable to produce strong airstreams in your home and are able to quickly distribute the heat.\nThe reason I recommend floor fans over wood stove fans is that they are\norders of magnitude stronger. I guarantee, a good floor fan will distribute the air in any room multi-use You can use floor fans not only to distribute wood stove heat but also in the summer heat when you want to vent your room. Or you can use them whenever you need to cool down and you don’t have air conditioning (AC) available.\nFloor fans are great for venting bathrooms after showering, or bedrooms after sleeping. They are able to blow the entire moist air out the window within just a few minutes.\nElectric floor fans are among my favorite products. They are affordable and I think that people underestimate their usefulness greatly.\nI have a floor fan at home classified as a “wind machine” and it’s one of the best purchases I ever made. I can’t find the exact same model online because I bought it in Europe, but this High-Velocity floor fan here looks very similar (click here to view it on amazon).\nThese fans can move huge amounts of air over big distances across your home. Floor fans have CFM ratings of well over 4000. The one I linked above has a rating of 4650, which is approximately 40x as strong as a wood stove fan.\nOn the strongest setting, they are noisy (wind always produces noise) but you can turn them on in bursts instead of leaving them on continuously. Or you can just pick a lower airspeed setting.\nConclusion Wood stove fans are gadgets, but can still be worth it. They are just a toy to have fun with. Wood stove fans will not significantly impact the efficiency of your wood stove. Because of the inefficient conversion of heat to rotational energy which blows the air, wood stove fans are generally weak and don’t make that much of a difference.\nThey blow some air, but if you have a serious heat distribution problem, there are better alternatives that cost not much more than a wood stove fan.\nHowever, you should still get a wood stove fan if one of the following statements is true:\nYou love gadgets and think wood stove fans are fun to look at. The physics of the wood stove fan are interesting to you and you want to explain them to guests (as an ice breaker). You are fine with slightly better distribution of heat - you don’t really rely on the wood stove fan to keep your home warm. Your kids will learn something from it. You sit rather close to the wood stove. In any case, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have access to electricity where your wood stove is, a wood stove fan is always worth it.\nIf, however, you need to seriously distribute heat in your home, and you have access to electricity, a high-velocity floor fan is a much better option. Floor fans are able to push large amounts of air within and even between different rooms and distribute the heat quickly and reliably.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-wood-stove-fans-worth-it/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre wood stove fans worth it?

Will space heaters eventually catch flames? Or will they break? In this article, we are going to explore these questions. After reading this, you’ll be confident and able to use your space heater responsibly.\nQuick answer: All quality space heaters theoretically are safe to run 24h a day. As long as you are in the same room, you can leave a space heater on. Modern space heaters have built-in safety features such as a temperature controlling thermostat, tip-over protection, and overheat protection, which reduce risk of fire.\nThis is not only a question about safety. But other factors also become part of the equation. For example, when you run a space heater continuously, how much will it cost you?\nAnd will the space heater break soon when you run it 24/7?\nLet’s have a look.\nHow long can you leave a space heater on? All quality modern space heaters are designed to run for long periods of time. Many people use space heaters as their primary source of heat. Heating just individual rooms, instead of the entire house saves them money.\nHere, I emphasize the terms quality and modern. With quality, I mean that you should use a heater that has a solid appearance and is made of good and fireproof materials. Some cheap supermarket space heaters are made completely of low-quality plastic. These cheap materials wear down quickly and sometimes even melt.\nWhen you run a space heater for long times, its surface temperature increases. That’s why you want to have a solidly built product.\nAside from the build quality of the space heater, it is also important that your space heater is relatively modern. Space heater technologies evolve rather slowly. So, you can consider anything that is younger than 10-15 years as modern.\nThe reason is that modern space heaters come with several built-in safety features which greatly improve their reliability. The most important reliability feature is overheat protection. Overheat protection turns a space heater off when it becomes too hot.\nThis means that even though your space heater runs for long times, it is never in danger of overheating and causing a fire.\nA high-quality and modern space heater can be left on 24h a day. It should come with several safety features that prevent disaster and should be made of fireproof material.\nThe space heater I would personally trust to run for very long periods of time would be this De’Longhi oil-filled radiator (click here to see it on amazon).\nCan you leave a space heater on at night? If your space heater is of good quality and has all the necessary safety features, you can leave it on overnight without worry.\nIt is important that your space heater has built-in overheat protection and a thermostat that keeps the temperature at a set level. These two functions ensure that the space heater never gets too hot.\nAside from that, I would suggest you make sure that small children or pets in your house can access the space heater at night. Either you should place the space heater in a safe, inaccessible place. Or you should ensure that children and pets can’t access your bedroom at night. The reason is that while you sleep, children and pets can burn themselves on the heater.\nBut, yes, technically you can leave a space heater on at night.\nLeaving a space heater on overnight is, however, not in all cases the most cost-effective decision. Financially, running a space heater at night costs you significant money without you even noticing the heat most of the time. So, is it really worth it to run your space heater overnight?\nThat’s a personal decision.\nBut my personal suggestions would be to save the few bucks in electricity cost each night and go with a hot water bottle in your bed. Or you can program your space heater using the built-in timer (if it has one).\nAlternatively, you can buy a wall outlet timer to program the times at which your space heater runs. In case you are interested in that, check this article about using a space heater with a timer (click here to view it).\nWhich space heaters are the safest? There are thousands of different space heaters available online. How do you know which ones are best suited for running long times?\nGenerally, for long, reliable and safe usage, oil-filled radiators are the best type of space heaters. Oil-filled radiators consist of a big oil-filled metal body. Inside the oil, there is an embedded electric heating element.\nThe oil carries the heat from the heating element to the large metal surface, which consists of many chimneys that exchange the heat with the surrounding air.\nBecause of this effective heat distribution concept, oil-filled radiators never reach large surface temperatures. Yet, they heat rooms just as well, if not better than other types of electric space heaters.\nOil-filled radiators rely on distribution of heat, which makes them exceptionally durable. No single part of the heater is exposed to high temperatures. Also, there are no moving parts in the space heater, such as built-in fans or a rotating axis.\nThe distribution of heat and the absence of moving parts makes oil-filled heaters the most durable type of space heater since there is no part that wears down quickly.\nYou can only break an oil-filled radiator by force. It is very unlikely to break on its own. Just until recently, we had a 30-year-old oil-filled radiator in our house, which worked perfectly fine, even when we discarded it.\nIf you want to have such a safe, reliable, and durable space heater as well, I advise you to check the oil-filled radiators in my article about the 3 best space heaters you can leave on all night(click here to view it).\nWhen you should always turn off your space heater Now, even when your space heater is well built and has all the needed safety features, you should not always leave it running.\nMost space heater accidents happen when nobody is at home. Even though space heaters are generally safe to run for long periods of time, unexpected things can happen around a space heater.\nFirst and foremost, space heaters are electronic products. Nobody can guarantee that they run without failure. And second, the surroundings of a space heater might be the cause of a disaster. It could be that thin curtains catch flame. Or a lighter refill propane bottle near the space heater heats up and explodes.\nThat’s why you can’t rely on your space heater only. You have to make sure its surroundings are safe as well.\nAnd if something ever goes wrong, there needs to be someone who is able to stop the disaster:\nNever keep a space heater running in your absence.\nAs long as you are in the same room as the space heater, nothing can happen. If the space heater fails and catches flames, you can extinguish the fire. But if you are absent, you will return to a burnt-down home, a dead pet, and lifelong debt and guilt.\nCan you trust a space heater to run reliably for long periods? Another question that might be relevant to your question is: How much do you worry?\nIn the previous section, we have seen that it is perfectly safe to run a space heater for many hours without interruption. In extreme cases, you can even run them for 24h a day.\nAs long as your space heater has all the required safety features (overheat protection and thermostat), and as long as you are in the same room as your space heater while it’s running, you can leave it on as long as you want.\nStill, running your space heater all the time does not always make sense. It also depends on your personality.\nAre you a confident person who trusts the space heater to run without issues? And if something goes wrong, do you know how to extinguish the flames? Are you clear-minded and quick to take action? If you can answer these questions, running a space heater 24/7 is no problem. You trust the space heater, but you are still aware that if something happens, you know what to do.\nThe other personality type is the insecure person. I think most people are rather insecure. If you are the kind of person that doesn’t trust a space heater to do its job, that’s not good.\nAlso, if you are not confident that you will react calmly if something happens, you should not leave the heater on for too long.\nInsecure people who don’t trust the heater and its safety features should only leave their space heater on as long as they’re comfortable. When you are such a person and feel like the heater is getting too hot (even though it has built-in overheat protection and a thermostat), then you should switch it off and let it cool.\nIt is not about actual danger. But more about your psychological wellbeing. Never do something you are not comfortable with. You will always have the space heater in the back of your head and you won’t be able to calm down.\nOnly leave space heaters running when you are comfortable with it. As soon as you start worrying, turn it off. Oftentimes, a little too much worry is better than acting overly confident.\nThe cost of running a space heater for long periods of time Running a space heater costs money. In another article about space heater electricity cost (click here to view it), I have done extensive research and calculated how much an average space heater costs you per month.\nThe electricity cost of a space heater depends on how much watts of power it draws from the wall outlet. An average 1500W electric space heater costs you $43.20 per month at a rate of 12 cents per kilowatt-hour.\nHowever, this result was calculated for 8 hours of daily usage. Since a day consists of 24 hours (24 = 3 times 8), the monthly costs for running a space heater continuously 24h a day will be $129.60.\nRunning an average space heater 24/7 costs you $129.60 a month.\nWhen will a space heater break if you leave it turned on? Space heaters are electronic devices. This means they will eventually break down. Will running them continuously lower a space heater’s life expectancy? Let’s have a look.\nWhile the previous sections dealt with the question: “How long is it safe to leave a space heater on?”, this section is about “How long can a space heater run continuously until it breaks?”\nAn average space heater will last you approximately 15-20 years with regular usage. That’s quite a long time. Let’s just say we have a space heater that lasts 16 years.\nThe average daily heating time over 16 years is 1h a day. In the summer months, the heater is not used, in the winter times a little more. The heater is placed somewhere and forgotten. Then it is reused for a garage workshop, or something similar. That’s the typical lifecycle of a space heater. It results in 1h average daily use.\nThis means in one year, the heater runs for 365h.\n16 years multiplied by 365 yearly hours is 5840h of total lifetime.\nNow let’s assume instead of running the heater for 1h a day, you run it for 24h a day.\n5840 hours of total space heater lifetime divided by 24h a day equals roughly 243 days of continuous usage.\nHowever, the 5840 hours of total lifetime assumes that the heater has a cool-down period every hour.\nLet’s guesstimate that the cooldown times increase the longevity of the heater by a factor of 4.\nThis means a regular heater would wear down after 60 days (2 months) of continuous usage.\nOf course, this is just a very rough estimation. I am sure, some cheap space heaters break down after a day or two, while others run for months or even years.\nIt all depends on quality.\nConclusion As long as you trust your heater, you can leave it on 24h a day. Just make sure you place it in a safe place where it can’t ignite anything. Also, make sure to always turn the space heater off when you leave the room.\nThen, you are safe.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-long-can-you-leave-space-heater-on/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow long can you leave a space heater on?

Or should you rather place them on the bare floor? And what if your floor is fully carpeted?\nMany websites online suggest to never put a space heater on a carpet. A quick search already revealed quotes such as the following\n“You should never sit a space heater on a carpet or area rug. The carpet will trap the heat, and the build-up of heat may cause a fire.”\ntemperaturemaster.com\nBut as an electrical engineer, I can tell you: This is an overly fearful perspective.\nQuick answer: Yes, you can put a space heater on the carpet. Since heat rises to the top, it is extremely unlikely for the carpet to accumulate enough heat to catch flame. The temperatures needed to ignite carpets are much higher than what space heaters can produce. The main safety threat of space heaters is unresponsible usage. As long as you are in the same room, there is no problem with running a space heater on carpet.\nYou might wonder why I say you can place your space heater on carpet, while nearly everyone else out there is recommending the opposite.\nIn the following sections, I will explain, why you should not worry about running your space heater on a carpet and what you should do to ensure you are safe at all times.\nRisk of putting a space heater on a carpet Let’s first have a quick look at the “Never place a space heater on a carpet”-perspective. This is the fearful perspective most people have.\nMost people reason that when a space heater is running on a carpet, heat accumulates between the heater and the carpet. Eventually, the heat will build up and cause a fire.\nEspecially thick and well-insulated carpets will trap heat, which either causes the carpet itself to catch flames, or it causes the space heater to overheat.\nThis perspective sounds reasonable at first. But in the next section, we will see why this fear can’t be backed up scientifically.\nWhy the risk is not as big as you think Let’s see why your carpet will surely not ignite just by having a space heater run on it.\nCarpets are hard to ignite Most home fires do not originate on the floor. Carpets are relatively hard to inflame.\nLet’s have a quick look at 3 different materials commonly used in carpets and their ignition and melting temperatures. The data is taken from the eco-terric flammability report:\nMaterialIgnition temperature (°F)Melting temperature (°F)Wool1058Does not meltCotton491Does not meltNylon905320Polyester905484Rayon788Does not meltIgnition and melting temperatures of different carpet materials\nIn the table above you can see the temperatures needed to ignite and melt different kinds of carpet.\nAll temperatures listed are definitely much higher than the surface temperatures a space heater generates. So, just through plain physics, it is already impossible for a space heater to ignite carpet.\nAnother point I find surprising is the very high ignition temperature of wool (honestly I thought wool would be the easiest to ignite).\nThe worst thing that can happen to you (as long as your space heater doesn’t explode), is that it tips over and melts parts of your Nylon carpet. But there is still no risk of fire.\nSpace heaters can’t ignite carpets because of the high ignition temperatures of carpets.\nSpace heaters have built-in safety mechanisms As long as you bought your space heater within the last, say, 15 years, it is almost guaranteed to have built-in overheat protection.\nThe built-in overheat protection senses when a space heater becomes too hot and shuts it off automatically.\nThis prevents another disaster from happening:\nNot only the carpet could ignite, but the space heater itself. With a thick carpet, the space heater has no way to get rid of the accumulated heat and can catch flames.\nRight? Wrong!\nFirst off, the carpet only covers the bottom side of the space heater. The bottom side of a space heater is naturally cool since hot air rises upwards and no space heater outputs heat downwards.\nAlso, the overheat protection would immediately shut off your space heater in case it gets too hot.\nYour space heater catching fire through overheating while standing on a carpet is highly unlikely.\nAs long as you use a reasonably safe space heater, nothing can happen. I wrote a review about my favorite safe oil-filled radiator (click here to view the product).\nFires need oxygen to burn Also, fires need oxygen to stay alive. Only the upper surface of a carpet is exposed to oxygen, which prevents the flame to nourish effectively. Most carpets you have at home are made of dense material and are densely knitted.\nTrying to inflame a carpet is like trying to inflame a flat tabletop. Even though it is made of wood, which is naturally inflammable, starting a fire on it is next to impossible.\nAll you will end up with is burn stains.\nMost carpets behave exactly the same. As long as you don’t put any inflammable liquids on them, trying to ignite a carpet is really hard.\nYes, there are some carpets that are easier to ignite than other kinds of carpets. But in general, the risk is not as big as you think it is.\nJust be reasonable with your space heater placement.\nWhich space heaters you can put on carpet You can put almost all space heaters on a carpet. All regular household heaters are suitable for usage on a carpet. This includes oil-filled radiators, infrared heaters, ceramic heaters, and other types of electric heaters.\nIt does not really matter which power rating a space heater has. Most American space heaters use 1500W of power. Europeans output 2000W of heating power. All of them are too weak to put a carpet on fire, regardless of the material.\nActually, the power is enough to ignite a fire. But space heaters distribute the heat through radiation. The power is not focused in one spot. This makes space heaters safe.\nAll household space heaters are generally safe to use on carpet. Of course, this does not mean you can run a space heater 24/7, even when you’re not at home.\nResponsible usage is what makes a space heater safe. In a later section, we’re going to cover some safety measures you should ensure in order to prevent fires.\nWhich space heaters you can’t put on carpet While you can use all regular electric household heaters on a carpet, you can’t use all space heaters in general. Some space heaters are not designed to be used in household spaces.\nUnsafe space heaters are first and foremost torpedo heaters. Torpedo heaters are propane (or other fuel) powered heaters that exhaust flames! These are meant to quickly heat industrial spaces, garages, or construction sites. Torpedo heaters are not meant to be used in living spaces such as your living room or your bedroom.\nOf course, there are exceptions. Especially, if you live in a remote place and don’t have access to electricity, using a torpedo or propane heater makes sense. However, in this case, you should never use them on carpets. Torpedo heaters output temperatures that go well above the ignition temperature of any regular carpet.\nSo, if you plan to use a torpedo heater at home, make sure to use it on a solid, non-inflammable surface.\nAdditional safety advice to run a space heater on carpet Now that we know whether regular space heaters are safe to be used on carpets, let’s have a look at some additional safety measures you can take.\nDon’t run the space heater in your absence The most important rule of electric space heater usage is to never use your space heater when you are not at home or when you are otherwise absent.\nThis, of course, also means: Never use a space heater on carpets when you are absent.\nEven though space heaters are generally safe, most house fires are caused by space heaters that were left alone running. Make this statistic your friend and always ensure space heaters are turned off when you leave the house.\nNow you are well prepared to use your space heater on a carpet. There are, however, still a few nice tips I found online.\nPut the space heater on ceramic flooring tiles “Buy some 18”x18” ceramic flooring tiles from a hardware store and put those on the carpet and the heater on top”\nReddit user ArrivesWithaBeverage\nThe ceramic absorbs the heat and distributes it. Ceramic is known to be fireproof. If you are still worried, installing ceramic flooring tiles is a reasonable choice.\nPut the space heater on an elevated surface Alternatively, if have a stool or small table you can put the space heater on it. However, I personally dislike that chairs and stools are oftentimes not stable enough and the space heater could tip over. Putting a space heater on the floor is generally better.\nUse a smaller space heater Also, if you are still worried, you could go for smaller-sized space heaters. There are some heaters that only use 750W of power, instead of the regular 1500W. These heaters consequently also produce less heat and therefore ignite far less often.\nConclusion Yes, you can run all regular household space heaters on carpet. Space heaters don’t simply ignite carpets. The temperatures needed to put a carpet on fire are far higher than what most space heaters produce.\nIn any case, the main security threat is not your space heater, but how you use it. As long as you act reasonably, you are perfectly safe.\nDo not use space heaters in your absence. Evaluate on your own and based on your feelings if you can place your space heater on a carpet.\nGenerally, it is safe. But if you don’t feel confident, you should look for another solution such as putting ceramic flooring tiles beneath your heater.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-put-a-space-heater-on-carpet/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you put a space heater on carpet?

In this article, we are going to go through potential causes. Don’t worry, it’s not going to be too technical.\nAnd after reading this, you will know exactly how you can fix your issue.\nQuick answer: When a space heater blows cold air or no air at all, it is usually due to a hardware failure. Some part of the electronic circuitry is likely broken. If your space heater does not blow air at all, it is likely that either the fan is broken or it does not receive enough power. Usually, fixing a space heater yourself is not worth it and dangerous. Instead, just buy a new one.\nWhat you should do in case your heater does not blow hot air is mostly a philosophical question. You have two options. Either you replace or you repair your heater.\nWhile replacing your heater is quick and easy, fixing it will save you some money.\nPossible causes for your space heater not blowing hot air In the following sections, we will have a look at the possible technical causes of your space heater not working.\nAlso, in each section, I give advice on how to approach the issue.\nBroken or blown electronics In the electronics of a space heater, many things can break. This includes fuses, resistors, capacitors, complex chips (integrated circuits), and many more.\nIf you have a good understanding of the electronics of a space heater, you can fix such an issue yourself. All you need to find the root cause is a multimeter to measure the voltages.\nHowever, one question arises. If you measure voltages, how do you know if the voltages are correct?\nThis is hard to know when you don’t have the hardware plans of the manufacturer which describe the exact voltages and resistances in the circuit.\nSo, troubleshooting a broken space heater with a multimeter alone is oftentimes cumbersome. You have to measure voltages across the circuit and figure out yourself how the actual voltage values should be.\nOftentimes this is a matter of training and experience. Detecting hardware failure by measuring alone is therefore mostly too hard if you are not a technical professional.\nDetect broken electronics by sight From my experience, there is a much more reliable way to detect faults in electronic circuitry. All you need is a pair of good eyes.\nOpen your space heater and look carefully at all the electronic circuit parts inside. Oftentimes, when a part is blown, you can instantly see it.\nUsually, there are burn marks around blown parts. Another frequent issue could be that a leg of a part is broken off. Or a part could be hovering above a connection without contact.\nTo discover broken off legs or “hovering” legs you need to look very carefully. A magnifying glass and a desk lamp is helpful in this case.\nHow to fix broken electronics in a space heater To fix blown or broken parts you need a soldering iron and soldering skills. Also, you will need to replace the broken part. Find a matching piece online and purchase it.\nTo find the right replacement parts, you need to google the letters and numbers you see imprinted on the part. For resistors and capacitors, you need to look for parts online with matching color bands. For SMD (Surface Mount Device, or in plain English: the very small) parts, finding replacements is harder since resistors and capacitors of different ratings all look alike.\nWhen you find the right replacement part online, order it and replace it in the electronic circuitry of the space heater.\nGenerally, fixing space heater electronics yourself is only recommended if you are experienced in electronics and you know how to properly solder.\nAlternatively, hire someone to fix the heater for you. But this is almost guaranteed to be as expensive as buying a new heater. Also, arranging someone and waiting for the issue to be resolved takes time and is usually not worth it.\nBroken heating element Another potential issue could be a broken heating element. Inside each space heater, there is a heating element that produces the heat. For electric space heaters, this is usually a heater coil (made of metal), a ceramic heating element, or an infrared heating element.\nIn case you have an infrared heater, it is very easy to check if your infrared heating element is broken. The reason is that the heating element of an infrared heater is always exposed and therefore easy to check.\nInfrared heating elements usually glow orange-red. The light you see is not infrared. It is just the small visible part of the heat radiation. Anyways: If you turn an infrared heater on, you immediately see it glowing.\nIf your infrared heater doesn’t glow, that means the heating element does not receive enough power or is broken.\nOther (oftentimes cheaper) electric space heaters have a metal heating coil. This coil also starts glowing bright orange-red. The difference is just that for some heaters it is embedded into the space heater’s body.\nThis is the case for Dyson heaters (and many other brands) and for all oil-filled radiators. In case you have an oil-filled radiator, it’s next to impossible to open the heater and fix the issue (there will be oil all over the place). For other electric space heaters with a metal heating element, you will have to open the case and see if the space heater gets hot when you turn it on.\nHow to fix a broken heating element In any case, a broken heating coil is hard to fix. You would have to replace the heating coil with a matching replacement part. And matching replacements are hardly available and difficult to find. In the best case, you can order replacements directly from the space heater manufacturer.\nIf you are knowledgeable in electronics, you can also bypass the heating coil with a thick wire.\nThis is, obviously just a workaround and significantly more dangerous than an actual heating coil. Also, you should only do it if multiple heating coils are present in your space heater. I don’t advise this method but it is a possibility.\nA heating element is, in the end, just a piece of thick wire.\nGenerally, replacing parts in electric space heaters should be done by professionals. The cost of hiring someone to fix it for you makes the repair hardly worth it. Mostly it is better to just get a new space heater.\nYou can spend the time you save by just buying a new heater on something that makes you happy.\nBroken thermostat Another possible cause of your space heater blowing cold air could be a broken thermostat.\nA thermostat controls the temperature your space heater generates. Essentially, a thermostat is a simple feedback loop.\n\u0026ldquo;A thermometer is something that measures the temperature; a thermostat is something that tries to maintain the temperature (keep it roughly the same).\u0026rdquo;\nexplainthatstuff.com\nHow a thermostat works The space heater draws power from a wall outlet and converts it to heat using an electric heating element (infrared, ceramic, wire). While it’s heating, the thermostat constantly measures the present temperature using a built-in thermometer.\nThen the thermostat inside your space heater compares the current temperature with the desired temperature set in the thermostat control. Usually, you set the thermostat temperature using a knob or via a digital display.\nWhen the thermostat control notices the current temperature is higher than the desired temperature, it shuts the heating power off. But it keeps measuring the temperature.\nOnce your room temperature drops below the desired temperature, the heater starts heating again.\nThis is called a two-point control because there are two points at which the space heater operates: Heat on, heat off.\nThere are also more advanced thermometer control algorithms where heat output is smoothly lowered or increased in order to reach the target temperature. But this is out of scope here.\nSince a thermostat is an electric control, it consists of multiple components. The two most important are the control unit which generates the “heat output suggestions” and the sensor unit, which in this case is a thermometer.\nTherefore, when a thermostat is broken, there are two possible causes:\nthe thermostat control itself the thermometer sensor How to fix a broken thermostat Both of these could be broken. In the end, again, this problem reduces to an electronic fault.\nAnd you need to understand the feedback loop of the thermostat in order to fix it. In case your space heater is not blowing hot air, the thermostat believes that the current temperature is higher than the desired temperature\nTherefore it is likely a fault in the thermometer. Electric thermometers are usually temperature-sensitive resistors. But in case the fault is in the control itself, it is likely an issue with an integrated circuit chip, which needs to be replaced.\nIf you know what you do, you can try and fix this issue yourself. Else, just save yourself some time and just get a new heater.\nClogged air filter A really common reason for not heating space heaters is clogged and dirty air filters. Check if your air filter is clogged with dust.\nWhen the air filter inside your space heater is clogged, two scenarios can happen.\nThe first scenario is that your heater is actually producing heat and everything is working fine. Except the clogged air filter prevents the fan from blowing the hot air out. The air channel is blocked.\nThe other scenario is that your space heater does not blow hot air, but cold air instead.\nIn this case, the heat generated inside the space heater activates the overheat protection and turns off the heater. Then, it could be that your space heater blows cold air only.\nIn any case, here’s how to fix a clogged air filter:\nHow to fix a clogged air filter Open the space heater and remove the air filter. This procedure is different for each space heater, so you have to find for yourself which screws you have to open and where the air filter is located. Remember to unplug the heater before opening it.\nThen remove the dust on the air filter and on the fan itself using a brush. If you don’t have a brush, you can oftentimes also pull the dust off with your fingers.\nImportant note: Don’t wet clean the air filter and the fan. Everything has to stay bone dry. The reason is that bacteria accumulate on your air filter. Your air filter is a perfect breeding ground for microorganisms. When you clean it with water, you “activate” these bacteria and they start growing.\nWhen you turn your space heater on after wet cleaning it, it will start stinking badly. Also: Who wants to blow bacteria into their home?\nTherefore remember: Only dry clean air filters!\nDefective fan If your heater does not blow air at all and the air filter is not clogged, the fan itself might be broken.\nIn this case, you should check if the heater’s body gets warm. Because if only the fan is defective, but the heating element still works, then heat is still produced.\nThe heat is just not distributed in your room because your heater does not blow the hot air out.\nIn case you have an old heater and its fan is defective, it gets especially dangerous. The heat that is not distributed is kept inside the heater and causes the heater to overheat. Modern heaters immediately turn off once they sense overheating. But old heaters sometimes don’t.\nThe reason is that old heaters sometimes don’t have built-in overheat protection. Therefore they don’t “notice” that they are overheating and might not turn off.\nThe accumulated heat in your space heater then becomes a safety threat. In the worst-case, your heater could catch flames and cause a house fire.\nIf your heater gets warm and it’s just not blowing hot air because the fan is broken, then shut off your heater instantly and stop using it.\nIt can catch fire anytime.\nIf you are familiar with electronics, you can fix this yourself by checking if the fan receives enough voltage.\nIn case the fan receives sufficient power, but it does not blow hot air, then you need to replace it with an equivalent fan with similar or ideally the same ratings.\nReplacing a fan is something you could do yourself, given you enjoy electronics and you have some basic knowledge. This fix is not too dangerous (as compared to fixing the heating element yourself). A layman could do it.\nThe fan inside a space heater usually does not directly connect to high voltages and therefore the danger during and after a self-made fix is comparably small.\nIn any case, you can not keep using the heater if it produces heat but it does not blow the hot air.\nIf you don’t feel confident fixing the issue yourself, buy a new heater.\nHow to fix your space heater not blowing hot air There are always two approaches to fix your space heater not blowing hot air. One approach is rather obvious. It is fixing the electronics. The other approach is A LOT less troublesome. Let’s have a look at the difficult method first.\nTroubleshoot the electronics and replace broken parts To fix the electronics, you need to be knowledgeable in how the space heater works and you need a good sense of electronics as well.\nAlso, you need a set of tools consisting of a multimeter (to measure voltages and resistances), screwdrivers, and a soldering iron. With the screwdrivers, you open the heater case. With the soldering iron, you can replace the damaged parts.\nAside from that, you need a pair of good eyes. Having good eyes is very handy when troubleshooting issues and finding broken parts in the electronic circuitry. Oftentimes you can see the issue by simply looking at the circuit board. Some parts might be blown off or damaged.\nOnce you find the broken part, you need to research which properties it has (resistances, voltage ratings, etc.) or search for it online using the number written on the part. This, however, only works for bigger chips.\nThen you need to replace it by soldering. If you are familiar with soldering: Great!\nElse, I recommend this video for learning:\n\u0026amp;ab_channel=GreatScott%21\nThe trouble-free method to fix a broken heater This method is a little philosophical. But I like it anyways. Oftentimes, people stress out over little things in life. Such as “How do I fix my heater blowing cold air?”.\nBut oftentimes, the trouble is not worth your time. Instead of spending money to get the right tools and replacement parts, or even hire an electrician, it is usually best to just go ahead and dump your space heater.\nGet a new space heater. Broken heaters are a much higher threat to your home safety than new ones. Broken heaters cause fires. Especially when you repair them incorrectly.\nYes, you might save $100. But you will waste hours or even days figuring out the source of the issue. And mostly, your time is worth more than that.\nSimply get a new space heater and stop worrying.\nThere are two space heaters I generally like to recommend:\nInfrared heater: This Dr. Infrared DR-968 (click here to view it on amazon) Oil-filled radiator: This Pelonis oil-filled radiator(click here to view it on amazon) Both are great. Just pick the one you prefer!\nI\u0026rsquo;d suggest getting the infrared heater if you prefer infrared heat, which is more bundled and directional. If you prefer heating your entire room evenly, get the oil-filled radiator!\nConclusion Wow, this article really went in-depth! We covered lots of ground and I hope you learned something.\nUsually, when your space heater is not blowing hot air, but cold air instead, it is a hardware failure. Somewhere in the electronics, something went wrong.\nGoing through the different sections above hopefully helped you troubleshoot your space heater.\nIf you are good at electronics, you can try most fixes yourself. However, if you are an amateur or not knowledgeable at all, usually the best way to fix your space heater is by simply replacing it.\nThis is especially true if you don’t enjoy DIY electronics. Save yourself the hassle and get rid of your broken space heater.\nBy the way: I wrote an article about discarding old space heaters.

With their popular air-multiplier technology, Dyson advertises their heaters to be strong. But how much noise does a Dyson Pure Hot + Cool generate?\nQuick answer: Yes, Dyson heaters can get noisy. The Dyson Pure Hot + Cool models provide fan speed settings. The higher the setting, the louder it is. On the lowest setting, a Dyson heater fan is very quiet. However, the high fan speed setting is very loud.\nBut how loud are Dyson heaters really? In this article, we’re going to find out and look at different sources and also videos where you can have a look at the loudness of a Dyson heater fan.\nPlease note that we base this review on the Dyson Hot + Cool heaters (click here to see one).\nHow loud are Dyson heaters? Dyson heaters are loud. It is hard to describe the loudness of a Dyson heater in text, so let’s have a look at two videos where the noise of Dyson heaters becomes apparent.\n\u0026amp;ab_channel=wiseoldconsumer\nIn this first video, you can hear how loud a Dyson Hot + Cool AM05 is. I found a comment under the video very interesting where one user writes\n“ I am considering it because of the noise”, someone writes in the comments. So, literally, the Dyson Hot + Cool AM05 is known for its loudness and there are even people buying it because it’s loud. The reason is that the noise helps some people calm down as it suppresses other noises such as traffic or a buzzing fridge.\nOf course, the people wanting to buy a heater because it is noisy are the exception. So, let’s have a look at another video to deepen our impression of the Dyson heater noise.\n\u0026amp;ab_channel=Unsharpen\nIn this video, you can hear the noise level of a Dyson fan on different settings. The video starts with the Dyson fan turned on on the lowest airflow setting. Then with time, the guy in the video increases the airflow setting to the maximum. By the way: If you can’t hear anything, turn up the volume.\nThe strength of the Dyson heater fan is, as the channel owner says in the low settings. On airflow setting 1-2 the Dyson fan is near silent, which is a big advantage as compared to other space heaters with built-in fans which are noisy at any airflow level.\nHowever, when you increase the airflow setting to 8-10, Dyson heaters get disturbingly loud.\n“Man I really hate how loud these fans get on full setting\u0026hellip; sounds like a really quiet version of those hand blow dryers”\ncomment by a viewer (xPorsum)\nAs long as you don’t need too strong airflow, Dyson heaters are reasonably quiet. On the lowest settings, a Dyson heater is silent.\nThe physics of heater noise I think the noise is (mostly) inevitable. Dyson heaters convection based. This means they rely on the movement of air. Convection is just a fancy word for the movement of gases in physics.\nMoving air always creates sound. The moving air as a whole, however, does not create the sound. It is the tiny imperfections that air passes over where sound is created. For example, when air passes over a sharp corner, both the corner and the air around the corner start vibrating. The air forms tiny “whirlpools” that cause vibrations. These vibrations in the air travel to your ear and make you perceive the noise.\nSharp corners are present in Dyson fans where the air exits through the sharply designed O-shaped air exhaust. Because of this sharp design, Dyson heaters are able to create lots of noise. Especially in the high settings. I admit that I find the sharp design very appealing. It also increases the airflow speed by forcing the air through the tight slits. But the elegant design comes with the cost of noise.\nDo silent heaters exist? Now that we understand where the noise in a Dyson Hot + Cool fan comes from, it would be interesting to know if silent heaters even exist. After all, any movement of air causes noise, right?\nNot necessarily. If you paid attention to the previous paragraphs, it is not the movement of air that causes noise. Humans perceive vibrations in the air as noise.\nTherefore, any heater that does not create vibrating air should be silent.\nYes, silent heaters exist.\nAny heater that does not produce forced airflows does not create noise. This includes, for example, all oil-filled heaters that have no built-in fans and infrared heaters. I have both types of heaters at home and both are absolutely silent. Except for an occasional clicking noise every 10-20 minutes when they auto-shut-off to prevent overheating, there is no noise.\nIf you are looking for a silent heater (rather than a noisy and expensive Dyson heater), then have a look at my favorite oil-filled radiator (click here to see my review and to see it on amazon). If silence is a priority, I would certainly get this heater over any other.\nOn the other hand, space heaters with ceramic heating elements or other electric heating elements mostly rely on a fan to push the hot air out of the heater.\nCan a Dyson heater fan be silent? Now, if you still want a Dyson heater, but you are not really satisfied with it being noisy, you may ask yourself if you can silently use a Dyson heater.\nYes, you can keep a Dyson heater fan silent by putting it on low settings. Since the loudness depends entirely on the amount of vibration generated through airflow, all you need to do is to lower the airflow settings.\nDon’t worry. This does not impact the heating capability of the Dyson Hot + Cool heater fan. It just reduces the speed at which the heat is distributed in your room. A Dyson heater fan with airflow speed set to 1 or 2 is still capable of keeping you warm in your room.\nRemember: You can independently set the airflow speed and heating settings. The thermostat control which is responsible for keeping your room at your desired temperature, and the airflow speed control are independent of each other.\nTo heat silently, lower the airflow speed and increase the heat setting.\nCan you silence a Dyson heater fan? From everything said prior, we can already conclude that a Dyson heater is never silent on high airflow speed settings. This means you can’t heat your room with a strong stream of air.\nIt is physically not possible since high airflow speeds cause vibrations which in turn create noise.\nSo here’s an idea: Maybe you could soundproof the Dyson heater using soundproof material, towels, or similar.\nWould this work?\nNo! Well, … yes. It might dampen the noise. But at high risk. Adding extra materials to your Dyson heater effectively adds new layers of insulation which the Dyson engineers did not account for. The Dyson heater might overheat because the heat can’t easily escape through the case.\nSo, DIY soundproofing your Dyson heater in order to reduce the noise is not a good idea. There is no way to silence a Dyson heater fan except for lowering the airflow settings.\nConclusion Are Dyson heaters noisy? Yes, Dyson heaters can get very noisy on the high airflow speed settings. The strong airflow creates vibrations that we humans perceive as loud noise. To use a Dyson heater silently, keep the airflow speed settings low, then you will be fine.\nIf you absolutely can’t handle noise in a heater then the Dyson Hot + Cool products are not for you.\nIn this case, I would recommend getting an oil-filled radiator or an infrared heater. Both of these types of heaters don’t rely on air being distributed. Therefore, they don’t create any noise.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-dyson-heaters-noisy/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre Dyson heaters noisy?

Dyson heaters are among the best-looking heaters. Their design is widely recognizable. This does not only apply to Dyson space heaters, but also to Dyson vacuum cleaners and other products.\nBut how safe are Dyson heaters? Do they have any unique safety features that other space heaters do not provide? And how does Dyson compare to other heater brands safety-wise?\nIn this article, we’re going to explore the answers to these questions. As an electrical engineer, I am staying critical of any advertising claims made by Dyson. My goal is to provide you with a simple, yet realistic understanding of the real safety of Dyson space heaters.\nQuick answer: Dyson heaters are safe. Due to their design, Dyson heaters provide unique safety features, such as embedded heating elements and fans which greatly reduce the risk of cutting or burning yourself. However, Dyson heaters are not perfect. They are relatively easy to tip over due to their light weight. Yet, they provide the same heating capabilities as bigger heaters and output the same 1500W of power.\nNow, let’s have a deeper look at the specific safety features Dyson heaters offer.\nPlease note: In this article, I am considering mainly the Dyson AM09 Hot and Cool (click here to view it on amazon). Some technical details may vary among models. But I think this heater is a good representation of Dyson heaters in general.\nSafety advantages of Dyson heaters At the first glance, you can already see that Dyson space heaters are built differently than other heaters. They have a unique (and probably patented) design and are very popular at the moment.\nThe design of Dyson heaters, however, is not entirely due to good looks. It also provides a few built-in safety features.\nThe bladeless fan makes Dyson heaters safe Dyson heaters advertise their “air-multiplier technology”. In the end, the air multiplicator is just a fan built into the case of the Dyson heater. The stream of air is projected upwards and then pushed out of the “air multiplier ring”. Dyson calls this a bladeless fan, but realistically, it is a regular fan in a fancy encasing.\nSafety-wise this is a big advantage. Especially when you have kids or pets. The encapsulated “bladeless” fan makes it impossible to cut yourself. In contrast, other space heaters have built-in fans which are relatively accessible. They are protected by a metal grid or not at all. There, a kid could poke his fingers into the fan, or damage the fan with a stick.\nSafe surface temperatures According to popsci.com Dyson heaters stay at safe temperatures and their surfaces stay cool due to clever usage of insulation\n“An insulating polymer sheath separates its two 10-inch-high ceramic heating elements from the device’s outer walls. And the outer walls themselves are lined in foil to reflect heat back inward.”\npopsci.com\nThe insulation does not only reduce the surface temperature of the Dyson space heater. It also increases the temperature of the output air stream. This improves your control over the space heater and effectively also over the heat distribution within your room.\nWithout the insulation, some heat would penetrate through the heater\u0026rsquo;s surface and cause the heater to be hot to touch. Just like an oil-filled radiator which relies on distributing its heat via a hot surface instead of convection (eg. a stream of warm air).\nThe well-insulated case of a Dyson Hot and Cool space heater ensures that pets and kids won’t burn themselves.\nSafety features that Dyson has in common with other brands Until now, we have talked about the Dyson-specific safety features that the Dyson Hot and Cool heater comes with. However, all Dyson heaters come with an additional set of common safety functions that are very common among space heaters.\nI am listing these features in this section, as Dyson might advertise them as something special. But as a matter of fact, these features are very common and not unique to Dyson.\nTip-over protection Dyson heaters have built-in tip-over protection. The tip-over protection is a switch that is triggered when the heater tips over, which automatically and instantly shuts off the heater.\nIn the past, lots of accidents happened because of tipped-over heaters which continued heating. When tipped over a non-protected heater overheats quickly and might cause inflammable objects to catch fire.\nLuckily, since most heaters, you can buy nowadays have built-in tip-over protection you don’t need to worry about this scenario anymore.\nOnce tipped over, a Dyson heater stops heating instantly. However, some of the residual heat might still be a threat. But that is only a tiny risk. Also possible would be that a Dyson heater tips over and falls a larger distance. On a hard impact, the heater’s case could break open and expose the very hot heating elements. This is very unlikely to happen. I just want to mention cases where tip-over protection is not capable to prevent damage.\nAside from the tip-over protection that automatically switches the heater off when it tips over, there is another useful safety feature.\nOverheat protection Not only do heaters become a safety threat when they tip over, but also when they get too hot. This is called overheating. To prevent overheating, Dyson heaters (and most other heater brands) have built-in overheat protection.\nOverheat protection is a sensor that constantly checks the temperature. If it gets too hot, a switch is triggered that automatically switches the heater off. With built-in overheat protection, the risk of too high surface temperatures of the heater is dramatically decreased.\nUsually, heaters cause fires by setting inflammable objects in a short distance or themselves on fire. Overheat protection helps with both of these cases.\nHere, again, I want to mention that overheat protection is not unique to Dyson heaters. So, when Dyson advertises their heater safety and mentions their overheat protection, this is nothing special.\nOverheat protection is common practice in the heating industry. Rather, you should be extremely cautious of heaters that do not have built-in overheat protection.\nSimilar to tip-over protection, overheat protection is very useful when you have kids or animals at home. A kid might build a fortress of pillows and blankets during play. It might have the idea to heat its fortress using a space heater. In this case, overheat protection is an immediate lifesaver!\nA space heater covered by blankets is likely to overheat or even catch fire fast. So, space heaters with overheat protection are a must when you are dealing with kids or pets.\nSafety problems of Dyson heaters Dyson heaters are not perfect. Even though they come with lots of safety upsides, there must also be some downsides. This section is dedicated to them. Now, let’s have a look at the safety problems of Dyson heaters.\nDyson heaters are easy to tip over Due to their tower-like design and their low weight, Dyson heaters are easy to tip over. A Dyson Pure Hot + Cool HP01 weighs only 8.6 pounds.\nHere’s a small table of Dyson heater weights. Personally, I think they should be heavier.\n**Model****Weight (in pounds)**Dyson Pure Hot + Cool HP018.6Dyson Pure Hot + Cool HP028.6Dyson Pure Cool TP017.9Various Dyson heaters and their weights\nAny low-weight but tall object is easy to tip over. Especially for children and animals the size of a cat or bigger.\nFrom the previous sections, we know that Dyson heaters have built-in tip-over protection that automatically shuts the heating off when the heater tips over. However, the tower-like heater can not only cause damage through heat but also through impact.\nIt might hit a fragile object and cause it to break, such as a glass vase, a bottle of red wine, or a framed image. These kinds of mini-disasters are best to avoid when you have kids or pets running around. Therefore you should carefully pick the right place to position the heater.\nDyson heater remote contains magnets According to the official Dyson safety instructions, the Dyson Pure Hot + Cool remote control contains magnets. The magnets inside the remote could affect pacemakers, defibrillators, credit cards, or electronic storage media and cause permanent damage.\nAs an electrical engineer, I now feel the urge to find out whether this is a Dyson-specific problem or if all remote controls contain magnets. In the end, this article judges Dyson about this fact, so let’s stay neutral and find out.\nSome research later, I did not find anyone on the web mentioning magnets in remote controls except for the Dyson safety instructions. I’m curious why Dyson remotes have magnets while the safety instructions of other remotes don’t explicitly mention it.\nDyson heater design is not typical of space heaters Another potential safety issue of Dyson heaters is their design. They don’t look like typical heaters. The Dyson Pure Hot + Cool tower heaters look more like a fancy, well-designed fan. Therefore, some people might mistake the heater for a regular fan and spray air freshener or perfumes into it.\nThis is very risky when the Dyson heater blows hot air as the hot air could inflame the spray and turn the heater into a full-fledged flamethrower for a second. That is enough to put something in your home on fire which in turn puts everything else on fire.\nAre Dyson heaters as safe as other heater brands? In general, I would estimate that Dyson heaters have a similar or slightly better safety level when compared to other heater brands. The reason is the design of Dyson heaters, which hides the heating elements and the spinning blades of the fan inside the encasing.\nThis prevents a majority of accidents. All Dyson heaters do is blow hot air, which is just what you want.\nHowever, if you want to go for the safest type of heater, personally, I would not recommend a Dyson heater. Generally, oil-filled radiators are the safest heaters. They are heavy which makes it hard to tip them over. Also, they are very solid as they have a big metal heating body. Oil-filled radiators usually also have tip-over and overheat protection. They do get hot on the surface, just as all radiators do.\nIf you want to have a look at my favorite safe oil-filled radiator, check out my review of the Pelonis oil-filled radiator here (click the link to see it). I think safety-wise, this heater is hard to beat. And it is a lot cheaper than the Dyson Pure Hot + Cool heaters.\nConclusion Yes, Dyson heaters are safe. Due to their special design, dangerous parts such as the electric heating elements or the built-in fan are hidden from view and are inaccessible for children or pets. Additionally, Dyson heaters provide the same common safety features as other heater brands, which are overheating and tip-over protection.\nDyson heaters have some slight downsides. I think that the tower-like structure and the light weight of Dyson heaters make them easy to tip over.\nYet, Dyson heaters are perfectly fine safety-wise. If you want to have a safer product, an oil-filled radiator from Pelonis or DeLonghi might be better for you.\nAttributions: title image \u0026ldquo;Fans by Dyson\u0026rdquo; by Fastily under CC BY-SA 4.0 license\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-dyson-heaters-safe/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre Dyson heaters safe?

(A Critical Review)"},{"content":"Are Pelonis heaters energy efficient? The answer to this question is very simple. Yes, Pelonis heaters are energy efficient. But let’s have a closer look at what that means and why.\nQuick answer: Yes, technically, Pelonis heaters are 100% energy efficient. The reason is that all the input power from your wall outlet is converted to heat. There is no difference in efficiency between different heater brands. It might only be the case that some heaters feel more efficient than others because they heat up quicker.\nNow, let’s have a deeper look at the energy efficiency of Pelonis space heaters and why they are always 100% efficient.\nBy the way: If you are looking to buy a heater, check out this link to see my favorite Pelonis oil heater (click here to see the review).\nAll energy ends up as heat For most devices, to find out the energy efficiency, you have to find the amount of desired work being done by the machine in comparison to the energy that is being lost. Lost energy is always heat.\nFor example, for a car, efficiency is about how far you can drive (the work you desire) versus the energy lost through friction (which is converted to heat) and which results in fuel consumption.\nHowever, for heaters, the desired form of energy is already heat. All energy that you put into a heater ends up being converted to heat. Since heat is your desired form of energy, space heaters are always 100% energy efficient.\nAll heaters are 100% energy efficient It doesn’t matter if you buy a Pelonis heater or any other brand. All heaters are 100% energy efficient.\nThere are no space heaters more efficient than other heaters. When some heater brands advertise efficiency, that is a plain lie building upon the ignorance of the customers. Luckily you are reading this article.\nYou can even buy a $20 heater and compare it to a $500 heater. They will output exactly the same amount of heat given that both heaters have the same power rating (which is mostly 1500W).\nHeat distribution of Pelonis heaters When you heat your home, when you think about it, the temperature doesn’t really matter. What matters is how warm you feel. Your body doesn’t measure temperature as a number in Fahrenheit or Celsius, but it evaluates your well-being.\nTherefore, the temperature of your room or the power ratings of space heaters don’t really matter. What matters is that the heat from a heater goes towards you and warms your body.\nIn technical terms, all space heaters are 100% efficient. But from a point of view of your wellbeing, some heaters feel different than others.\nThe reason is that heaters transport the heat differently. Some heaters use radiation to transport heat, for example, infrared heaters. Other heaters use convection, which is the movement of warm air, such as oil-filled radiators.\nDepending on how a heater distributes heat, it might feel more or less efficient than other heaters.\nHeat distribution of infrared heaters Infrared heaters usually point in a fixed direction and radiate infrared rays. Infrared radiation, also commonly known as heat waves, is a very pleasant form of heat. As soon as you turn an infrared heater on, you can already feel the heat. Infrared heaters have no heat-up times. This is why they are mistakenly assumed to be more efficient than other heaters in terms of your electricity bill. However, as soon as you turn an infrared heater off, the heat vanishes almost immediately.\nThe advantage of an infrared heater is that it radiates in a specific direction. Infrared heaters do not distribute the heat radiation evenly in all directions. They do not warm up your entire home. Infrared heaters heat up only the objects and people in its line of sight.\nWhile an infrared heater consumes the same amount of power as any other type of electric space heater (usually 1500W), an infrared heater directs that power to a specific area only. Therefore, infrared heaters feel more efficient than other types of heaters. The area that the infrared heater points at warms up quickly. Meanwhile, the air of your room and the objects that are not in the line of sight of the infrared heater stay mostly cool.\nTherefore, an infrared heater provides quick heat, and it feels efficient. But it is not really suited to heat your living room or bedroom evenly. The perceived efficiency comes from the concentration of radiation in just one specific direction.\nWhen Pelonis infrared heaters are efficient Pelonis infrared heaters are especially efficient when you want to quickly heat a narrow space, without heating the whole room. For example when you want to keep yourself warm in a woodworking shop. Or for a quick workout in your garage gym. And also infrared heaters are efficient when you want to heat just yourself and your desk in a home office setting.\nHeat distribution of Pelonis oil-filled radiators The heat distribution of oil-filled radiators is different. Oil-filled radiators produce warm air instead of heat radiation. If the heater has no built-in fan, the warm air rises straight upward until it hits the ceiling of your room. Warm air then accumulates at the ceiling of the room and slowly moves down until you feel it.\nIf your Pelonis heater has a built-in fan, the heat is blown into whatever direction you desire. This speeds up the time until you feel the heat. However, it does not cause the entire room to heat up quicker. Again, it is all about heat distribution.\nSince oil-filled heaters produce warm air it takes some time until your room is warm and cozy. However, we as humans perceive the oil-filled radiator heat as much more comfortable than infrared heater heat. The reason is that an infrared heater does not heat up the air. The air actually stays cold. The heat radiation passes through the air molecules and heats up only the objects or people that the radiation “hits”.\nOnly after some time, infrared heaters heat the air through the heated objects.\nOil-filled radiators heat the air. But it takes time. Infrared heaters heat objects, but it is quick.\nTo get an entire room up to temperature, in the end, it doesn’t make a difference whether you use oil-filled or infrared heaters. As long as both heaters have the same 1500W power rating, both deliver the exact same amount of heat to your room.\nEfficiency is a matter of taste What do you consider efficient? Do you prefer to feel the heat almost instantly or are you patient and you can wait half an hour for your room temperature to rise?\nBased on this preference you should pick your Pelonis heater. There is no technical difference in efficiency. The only difference is in how you perceive the heat.\nFor quick heat, but little heat retention, pick an infrared heater. For slow but comfortable heat, pick an oil-filled radiator.\nThat’s it.\nConclusion You should not base your space heater choice on technical energy efficiency. Some heater brands may claim that their heaters are especially efficient. That is a plain lie. All space heaters are 100% efficient because all of the 1500W input power from your wall outlet is converted to heat.\nThese 100% efficiencies apply to all heating devices. Heat is the “lowest” form of energy. And therefore all energy ends up as heat at some point, which makes the efficiency 100%.\nEfficiency is not something to worry about when picking a Pelonis space heater.\nRather, you should pick your space heater based on your personal preferences. Do you prefer radiant or convection heat?\nIn this article, we have covered all of that so you can finally pick a heater that suits you!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-pelonis-heaters-energy-efficient/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre Pelonis heaters energy efficient?

Pelonis is a space heater brand that sells affordable heaters, such as ceramic tower heaters, oil-filled radiators, and electric heaters. Pelonis heaters come in all sizes and in various price points.\nSome popular Pelonis heater models are significantly cheaper than their higher-end advertised counterparts from brands such as DeLonghi. Are these cheap Pelonis heaters safe?\nIn this article, we find out whether Pelonis heaters are as safe as other brands. Also we uncover the most common safety issues with Pelonis heaters. Yes, there are some. So, let’s have a look.\nQuick answer: Yes, Pelonis heaters are generally safe. Pelonis provides the same safety features as other brands and produces their heaters to common safety standards. However, there are exceptions to the rule. Sometimes, Pelonis heaters with issues seem to pass quality control, which is why some heaters might be faulty. If you receive such a model, you can always return it.\nBy the way: As an independent blogger and electrical engineer, I am not affiliated with Pelonis. This is a critical and realistic review!\nAre Pelonis heaters safe? First off, as with all heaters that are sold in the US, Pelonis heaters have to fullfil safety regulations and standards. Pelonis heaters adhere to the common ETL and UL standard for space heaters. In general, all heaters that are tested under these standards fulfill a good basic set of safety criteria.\nSafety features in pelonis heaters Let’s have a look at the safety features Pelonis advertises.\nUsage of fire resistant materials One thing that looks interesting is that some Pelonis heaters made of fire resistant cool to the touch ABS UL94 material. I have no clue what this is, so let’s investigate:\nUL 94 is a United Laboratories standard. It standardizes the flamability of plastic materials. There are different flamability grades. Pelonis does not specify the flamability grade in its product descriptions on amazon. In the worst case, this means the plastic material is “slow burning”. You would prefer “no burning”, right?\nI am sure that if the material was graded higher, Pelonis would have mentioned it.\nOverheat protection is built in To make Pelonis heaters safe, most heaters come with overheat protection. Overheat protection is a simple mechanism that switches the heater off once it gets too hot. The heater, therefore, draws only a limited amount of power over time. This reduces the risk of fire.\nTip over protection Also, there is tip over protection. The tip over protection is a mechanism that detects when a space heater tips over. Heaters should always stand upright because that is the way they are designed. Also, it protects the heater from igniting when its damaged. Imagine your oil-filled radiator tips over and leaks oil. I am sure you don’t want the electric heating element to keep heating until the leaked oil catches flames.\nYou can plug it directly into a wall outlet Pelonis advertises that you can plug any Pelonis heater directly into a wall outlet. To me, this sounds a little ridiculous. Where else would you plug the heater instead? Also, why would plugging something else in between the heater and wall outlet help with safety?\nAs a Pelonis customer, I do not want to think about such stuff. It should be absolutely safe to plug it into a wall outlet. No need for Pelonis to mention it. Or is that something special?\nMost Pelonis heaters draw 1500W of power. This is the most common power rating for heaters in the US. And I assume that any wall outlet in the US should be able to handle 1500W power output. There are also some smaller 900W heaters available for paranoid users. But all in all: To me it is natural that I am able to plug my electric devices in any wall outlet I have at home. There is no need to advertise it.\nAdditional safety features present in Pelonis heaters In the section above I have listed safety features most Pelonis heaters are equipped with. In some heaters, however, Pelonis offers some additional nice-to-haves.\nSome heaters, for example, have programmable temperatures (using a thermostat) and heating times.\nThermostats ensure that the heater uses just the right amount of energy to keep your room at the desired temperature level. This works through a thermometer that constantly senses the present temperature in your room. Once the target temperature is neared or surpassed, the heater will adapt the heating power. Thermostats ensure that energy is not wasted. Also, they provide another layer of safety. With a temperature controlling thermostat, as long as the heater is working properly, it is impossible for the heater to overheat.\nSome Pelonis heaters also have built-in fans. To ensure maximum safety, those heaters oftentimes rotate in order to distribute the heat in all directions. This reduces the risk of a fire. But the movement might catch the interest of pets such as cats.\nSafest Pelonis heaters We care about safety. So, what are the safest Pelonis heaters?\nPersonally, I like the Pelonis oil-filled radiator most (click here to see my review of it). The reason is not the brand itself, but oil-filled radiators are the safest sort of space heater.\nThe Pelonis oil-filled radiator is safer than the Pelonis electric or ceramic heaters because the heating element is embedded inside the oil-filled metal heating body.\nTherefore, with an oil-filled radiator, it is impossible to touch it and burn yourself or even cause a fire. Oil-filled radiator surfaces of course get hot. But it’s not dangerously hot. Just as hot as a heat source needs to be without causing serious threats to safety.\nOther brands also build good and safe heaters, but Pelonis has a convincing price-quality relation. Pelonis still uses sturdy and solid materials. They just seem to produce their heaters more efficiently and cheaply. But as long as you are satisfied with “good and solid” instead of “perfect” quality, you are well set with a Pelonis heater.\nHow safe are Pelonis heaters compared to other brands? Compared to other brands like DeLonghi, Pelonis has no safety disadvantage. Pelonis has to adhere to national safety regulations like any other brand, otherwise, they wouldn’t be allowed to sell their heaters.\nIn general, there is no safety disadvantage when buying a Pelonis heater.\nOne point, however, would be reasonable to make. I am just speculating, but I would assume that Pelonis saves some money on quality assurance. They are producing lots of heaters for cheap prices. In general, the heaters are good. But on rare occasions, there are exceptions to the rule, as you can tell from the amazon user ratings. This is, where I would assume that Pelonis cuts some corners.\nInterestingly, more expensive brands such as DeLonghi have the same quality assurance problems, only a little less often. Not all heaters are perfect. But DeLonghi heaters may be perfect a little more often.\nThe safety of a heater corresponds to the price point The safety of a heater doesn’t depend on the brand. At least not for the most part. What is more important is the price point of the heater.\nCheap heaters generally tend to be engineered with fewer safety features and lower-quality materials. Whereas more expensive heaters tend to be more durable, fire-resistant, and safe.\nOne interesting note about heaters: Since all heaters consume 1500W of energy, they all heat the same. A cheap 1500W heater can heat your room just the same as an expensive 1500W heater. The price difference comes from materials used and engineering expenses. Therefore, expensive heaters don’t heat better but they are usually safer.\nOf course, this is a generalization. Some heater brands produce very good cheap heaters and are exceptions to this. Pelonis heater products are cheap. But within the set of Pelonis products, you find heaters ranging from $30 to $300. Here, the more expensive Pelonis heaters are safer.\nNote that all Pelonis heaters conform to the same safety regulations. Pelonis would argue that all of their heaters are perfectly safe to use. But from my engineering experience, I would argue that safety comes with higher prices.\nPotential safety issues with Pelonis heaters So far, I have only mentioned positive aspects about Pelonis heater safety. But upon deeper investigation, I discovered some potential flaws in Pelonis heaters. These flaws are rare and they occur across brands. They are not unique to Pelonis.\nAs a manufacturer, Pelonis produces hundreds of space heaters daily. They go through quality control and after a few weeks they end up in the customers’ homes.\nWhen I worked in the heating industry as an engineer myself, I found that not all issues are detected in quality control. That is the reason that sometimes customers are unsatisfied with their products. Even if just 1 out of 1000 products has an issue.\nHere are some safety issues with Pelonis heaters:\n1. Pelonis heater leaks oil According to one customer, their Pelonis oil-filled radiator “started leaking oily liquid”. This can happen if the oil-filled radiator’s heating body is not fully enclosed or has microfractures. Even bad transport can cause this. Or when the heater tips over and hits a sharp edge.\nThe oil encapsulated in the oil-filled radiator is not dangerous. However, leaking oil is always a bad sign and you should immediately discard the heater for a new one.\n2. Pelonis space heater makes sharp noises Another customer reports, their heater “just makes a high pitched noise and sounds dangerous”. These noises can come from imperfections in the electronic circuitry. Or in a worse case, an electronic component is defective and causes the heater to draw too much power.\nThe high power consumption needs an escape valve which is the production of these noises. Space heater noises are oftentimes bad signs, but other times they are harmless.\nIf your space heater makes noises, I have made this video with example noises, so you can troubleshoot your heater :\nhttps://youtu.be/DhFUXwC59FU\n3. Too thin power cord “AC power cable in the heater is too thin. I cannot believe the manufacturer use this kind of cable for 1500W heater.”\nreview on amazon\nSpace heaters draw a lot of power. A common space heater consumes 1500W of power. That is the amount of power that most wall outlets can handle. There are some high-power space heaters that consume more power, for example, 2500W. And some other space heaters consume less, for example, 500W.\nThe higher the power is that an electric space heater draws from the wall outlet, the thicker the power cable must be. The reason is that thin cables quickly overheat and burn when too much current flows through them. This is, by the way, how a lightbulb works.\nIf the power cable is too thin, there is an increased risk that the cable overheats. In rare cases, this is what leads to cable meltdown and fires.\nNormally, all space heaters are tested and designed to suit government requirements. Otherwise, companies are not allowed to sell their products. Therefore, in general, I would assume that the “too thin power cable”-issue happens only rarely. Either the manufacturer tried to save money on cables, or the product is bad. In both cases, the space heater company (e.g. Pelonis) would quickly lose credibility and trust.\nIf you worry about too thin power cords, then just buy the space heater and plug it in at home. Does the cable heat up? If yes, then it is too thin. Just return the space heater and you’re done.\nConclusion Pelonis heaters are generally safe heaters. They provide the same safety features as other heater brands. Also, you can expect a similar build quality.\nOf course, some people find quality issues and write negative reviews for Pelonis heaters. But that also happens for other heater brands like DeLonghi.\nIf you want to save some bucks, don’t hesitate to buy a Pelonis heater. I am perfectly happy with them.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-pelonis-heaters-safe/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre Pelonis heaters safe?

(A critical review)"},{"content":"How to assemble an oil heater. Assembling an oil heater is actually very easy, once you understand how it’s done. Since there are only confusing resources online, I created this helpful picture guide with real-life pictures.\nJust recently I received an oil-filled radiator myself. I did not even know that I have to assemble it myself. This presented itself as an opportunity for writing this article.\nQuick answer: Assembling an oil heater is simple. First, attach the wheels to the brackets. Then use the bent metal connectors to attach the brackets (with wheels) to the bottom of the oil heater. Place the oil heater upright. Wait a minute for the oil to flow down. And then turn the oil heater on.\nThis was just a quick text instruction. Don’t worry if you didn’t understand it yet. Images speak a thousand words. So let’s have a look at what to do in real life.\nPicture instructions to assemble an oil heater In this section, I am listing all the pictures I have taken when I assembled my new oil heater so you can follow along.\n1. Unpack the oil heater package contents Top: Big metal oil heater. Lower left: Wheels and bent metal pieces. Lower right: Metal brackets.\nIn the picture, you can see several things lying around. First, and most notably, you can see the big metal oil-filled radiator with a power cable attached. This piece is already fully assembled and you don’t need to worry about it.\nAll we have to do is to assemble the wheels and attach them to this metal body.\nBelow the heater, you can see wheels (with nuts and bolts), two “brackets” (the thin metal pieces with 4 drilled holes), and 2 bent “metal sticks”.\n2. Place the bent metal pieces between the oil heater ribs Place the bent metal piece behind one of the lower right columns of the oil heater. I chose the second outermost. But you can also use the outermost (which is probably better).\nPlace one bent metal stick behind the bottom pipe of the oil-filled radiator in the first “opening” (column / between the ribs) behind the front side of the heater.\n3. Attach the wheel-bracket to the heater Place one of the brackets onto the bent metal stick.\nStand the oil-filled upright (bottom side up) and put one of the two brackets onto both ends of the bent metal stick. The hollow side of the brackets must point away from the oil-filled radiator’s body.\nUse the nut to fix the bracket to the heater. Note: Don\u0026rsquo;t screw too tightly.\nOne end of the bent metal piece has a screw thread. This end of the bent metal stick has to be attached to the bracket using a nut that you screw down. Don’t screw it too tightly. The nut is (in my case) made of thin material and it looks very easy to break. Rather, screw the nut down until you notice a good resistance, but you can still easily unscrew it.\nThe other end of the bent metal piece has no screw thread. Since it is a bent end, it holds onto the bracket on its own. This may differ from model to model. If your bent metal stick has screw threads on both ends, then use nuts to attach both ends to the bracket.\n4. Repeat for the other side Repeat step 4 for the other bracket. This time, attach the bracket to the outermost column on the other side of the heater.\n5. Screw on the wheels Now use the additional nuts and bolts to connect the wheels to the outermost drilled holes on the brackets. Pay attention to the direction the wheels are facing. If you followed this guide, the heater is standing bottom side up. Therefore the wheels have to point upwards.\nI am emphasizing this because I attached the wheels to the other side of the brackets and ended up having to unscrew everything again.\n6. Turn over the oil heater and wait for the oil to settle Now you are almost finished! Turn the heater upside once more so the wheels are facing downward. Now, you should hear oil flowing around. Because we flipped the heater upside down in the beginning, the oil is moving to its original place again. Give the oil a minute to settle.\nAfter a minute, once the oil settled, you can turn the heater on for the first time!\nAlso, you can test your oil heater assembly by rolling the heater around on the floor. It should move easily on the blank floor. If you have a carpet, the rolling around will be a little harder of course.\nPosition the heater in a good spot Oil heaters heat through convection. This means that they produce hot air that transports the heat. By positioning the oil heater wisely you can improve the hot airflow.\nUsually, it is best to place an oil heater either below a window or in the middle of a room. When an oil heater produces heat standing below a window, the cold air from the window “pushes” the warm air into the room.\nOn the other hand, if you decide to place your oil heater in the middle of your room, the hot air rising from the heater and reflecting from the ceiling forms a “heat mushroom”.\nThis heat mushroom is inevitable. All heaters that don’t have a fan or infrared radiation cause “heat mushrooms”. By positioning the heater in a good spot, you can use this mushroom-shaped heat flow to your advantage.\nWhy do oil heaters have to be assembled?\nNow that your heater is fully assembled you might wonder why you even have to do this. And it is a good question. In the end, wheels could be built into the oil heater.\nThe main problems are the dimensions and weight of the oil heater. Oil heaters have a tower-like shape. Also, they are heavy. This shape and weight combination causes them to be very sensitive to sideways forces. In simple language: Oil heaters tip over easily.\nTo reduce the risk of a tip-over, the wheels have to be as far apart from each other as possible. However, just increasing the width of the wheel construction would also increase the volume of the packaging and increase shipping costs.\nTherefore, oil heater manufacturers usually decide to deliver the oil heater not fully assembled. It simply saves them money.\nPotential issues during oil heater assembly The quality of the metal brackets and the plastic wheels is not very good on most oil heaters. For that reason, you should be very careful when assembling the heater. This “cheap wheels”-phenomenon is apparent in all price ranges of oil heaters. But the cheaper the heater, the worse it usually gets.\nTherefore be careful when you screw the wheels onto the brackets. The wheels easily break. My oil heater wheels arrived with a plastic part already broken off on one wheel. It’s not critical, but not nice either.\nAnd also be careful when you screw the nuts and bolts together. The nuts, in my case, are very thin and I am 100% certain they break off if I screw them too tightly. An old german saying is:\n“After tight comes broken”\nold german saying\nTherefore be careful when you assemble your heater. The wheel assembly parts are not very solid and it’s better to be careful than to be sorry.\nConclusion Oil heaters are not hard to assemble. In this guide, I showed you how to assemble an oil heater. Just follow the picture guide above.\nThe oil-filled radiator assembly manual works for all oil heaters.\nI hope this article helped you assemble your heater!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-assemble-an-oil-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow to assemble an oil heater.

I took a deep dive into programmable space heaters for you and found 3 different heaters that are a good bang for the buck. All 3 heaters differ a little bit, but I will explain everything to you.\nThere’s one thing all 3 best programmable space heaters have in common: They are oil-filled radiators. I chose to stick to oil-filled radiators because I am convinced that once you are looking for a programmable space heater, you want to be able to leave it running independently of you. You want to automate the heating times and the temperatures.\nSince oil-filled heaters are the safest kind of heaters, they are my top personal top picks.\nThat being said, let’s have a look at my favorite programmable space heaters.\n3 Best Programmable Space Heaters Pelonis 14A(click here to view it on amazon) - My all-time favorite budget oil-filled radiator. The Pelonis 14A has a very simple built-in timer setting as well as a built-in thermostat. The best about the Pelonis oil-filled heater: Everything is kept simple. You don’t need to read the manual to understand how it works. The programming is intuitive and absolutely everyone can do it. Additionally, it does the same job as the more expensive DeLonghi heaters and provides the same safety features. It’s a perfect entry-level programmable oil heater purchase!\nMY FAVORITE: DeLonghi TRD40615T (click here to view it on amazon) - This heater has a patented surface design (chimneys) that allows for optimized airflow and better heat distribution. The programming works through a 24-hour dial timing system which has several settable 15-minute teeth you can switch ON and OFF (if you ever used an electric wall outlet timer: That’s the same). The advantage is that you can set multiple timeslots throughout the day where the heater turns on and off. For example, you can set the heater to turn on while you’re getting ready for work, then it can pre-heat the home before you come back. You can make the heater turn on and off whenever you like. And in comparison to the Pelonis oil-filled radiator above, you only need to set the times once and it will keep the settings as long as you want.\nDeLonghi TRD40615EBK (click here to view it on amazon) - This is another DeLonghi heater. Instead of a 24-hour dial system, it has a display with buttons to program a 24-hour timer and the thermostat. It’s a perfectly well-built heater capable to heat your room energy efficiently. If you want to pick one of the DeLonghi heaters, I would suggest you pick based on which way to program you to prefer. If you prefer a digital display with buttons, then go for this heater. But if you’re a little more the keep-it-simple-stupid kind of person (just like me), then go for the previous DeLonghi heater!\nMy preferred heater: The DeLonghi programmable space heater with a 24 hour dial.\nWhy I chose these programmable space heaters All the 3 programmable space heaters are oil-filled radiators with high-quality features. If you want a safe, reliable, and durable heater, these models are your go-getters. Here are the 5 reasons I chose these heaters in a little more detail.\nSafety Oil-filled radiators are the safest sort of electrical space heaters. All of the models listed are ETL certified. This means they went through a standardized Underwriters Laboratory (UL) testing procedure and passed it. UL is a global leader holding over 1,500 safety standards in the US and Canada.\nAside from the formal certification, oil-filled radiators have superior safety in comparison to other types of space heaters. The oil in an oil-filled radiator distributes the heat from the electric heating element to the metal surface. This effectively enlarges the heating area and reduces the surface temperature. There are no hot red-glowing and exposed heating elements. This makes an oil-filled radiator the perfect programmable heater. You can trust it to reliably heat your room.\nDurability The oil of the oil-filled radiator distributes the heat from the heating element. This evens out the heat distribution across the space heater and lowers wear and tear. Also, oil-filled radiators don’t contain moving parts which cause friction and potential points of failure.\nOil heaters can easily last you decades.\nQuality The three heaters I picked are all of really good quality. First, the Pelonis heater is a great bang for the buck. It gets the heating job done, looks pretty, and is made of decent materials. As it is a little cheaper than the two DeLonghi heaters, there has to be a slight difference in build and material quality. However, this small difference, from my perspective, does not matter too much as long as you are not moving the heater around too much and wearing it down. Usually, an oil heater just stands there waiting to be turned on and off again. So, materials don’t matter too much. I think the Pelonis heater is of very decent quality.\nThe DeLonghi heaters are a little higher quality. They look a bit sturdier and the surface finish is more elaborate.\nIn the end, all 3 programmable heaters are really well-built products and quality is nothing to worry about.\nPrice I picked all three heaters to come with different functionalities. The Pelonis heater is a cheap, but reliable worker. The DeLonghi heaters are fancier heaters with more detailed programming capabilities.\nNaturally, all three heaters are priced differently. However, all of them are good deals and worth every penny.\nUser ratings That the heaters are worth it becomes apparent when you check the user ratings.\n“This radiator heater has helped me stay warm when my room gets unusually cold. It’s very quiet, easy to use. I can set the temperature from 65 to 85 degrees and set a time on how long it runs. The best thing is it comes with remote control, I don’t need to get up to adjust the temperature if needed.”\nBuyer JC in an amazon rating\nAre programmable space heaters better than non-programmable heaters? In this article, we’re looking at the 3 best programmable space heaters. But are programmable space heaters even better than regular non-programmable space heaters?\nBoth programmable and non-programmable heaters fulfill the same quality and safety regulations. The only difference is the programmability. Programmable space heaters are only better if you make use of the programming functionalities.\nIf you are just looking for a regular space heater to turn on and off, you don’t really need to have a programmable model. Luckily, in our age of technology, the extra programming features are inexpensive to produce. Therefore getting a programmable heater over a non-programmable one does not offset the price a lot. I would estimate it is a 10% price difference.\nProgrammable space heaters are good primary heat sources Personally, I have a non-programmable space heater and I am perfectly fine with it. It suits my needs. However, the heater is not my primary source of heat.\nIf you get a space heater as a primary heat source, then the programming capabilities (timer and thermostat) are a big advantage. You can make the heater automatically turn on and off and enforce energy efficiency as well as warm temperatures in your home. You can tailor the heating exactly to your needs.\nTherefore, my suggestion is: If you look for a heater as a primary heat source, then you should get a programmable space heater. Programmable space heaters are great primary heat sources when you want to use the pre-heating and auto-turn off functionalities without you manually having to take care.\nAlso, if you are just someone who likes technology and you like being able to program something and you prefer more functionality over less, then a programmable heater is for you.\nBut if you just need a supplementary heat source, and you don’t have any special requirements, then a non-programmable space heater is good for you. I mean, who needs programmability if you don’t use it?\nProgrammable heaters save you money Another aspect that makes programmable space heaters absolutely worth it is that they automatically turn off whenever you need them. If you put in a little thought to when you need the space heater to heat and when not to, you can save significant money on your electricity bill.\nThe best thing: Once a programmable space heater is programmed, you can stop thinking about it and just leave it running. You do the thinking once. And the space heater will turn on and off at your specified times forever. At least until you unplug it.\nWhat can be programmed On most programmable space heaters, two parameters can be controlled.\nThe first programmable variable is the temperature of the heater. The temperature is controlled using a thermostat. It’s usually kept very simple. On the front panel of the space heater, you set a target temperature. And then the heater heats your room until it senses that the target temperature is reached. Then, the heater automatically turns off until it notices that the room temperature drops below the target temperature.\nThis is called two-point control and is the simplest form of control. It gets the job done. If you have a very advanced space heater, it might also have more advanced controls where the power consumption is controlled in order to approach the target temperature asymptotically. But that is another story of itself.\nThe second variable you can program is the times at which the heater is turned on. For simple heaters, you can only set an expiration timer until automatic shut off. The time can be anything from 10 minutes up to several hours, depending on the space heater.\nFor more complex heaters you set time slots in which the heater is turned on. This way you can have several heating periods throughout the day, as you require.\nThe downside, as far as I know, is that you can’t program different temperatures at different times. But this may be too complicated and unnecessary for everyday use. For that, I think you would need a home automation system. But you don’t need varying temperatures anyways. Just set a temperature you are comfortable at.\nHow to program a space heater for safety Usually, to reduce the risk of fire hazards, it makes sense to turn the heater on for limited timespans only instead of having it turned on continuously.\nMost commonly, people turn off their programmable oil heater at the night. For example, 1h after you fall asleep. And then, 30 minutes before you wake up in the morning, the heater can automatically turn back on.\nThis way, while you sleep, your heater is not actively producing heat. But before you wake up, it is already pre-heated. This makes it impossible for the heater to overheat while you are asleep. And also it will save you up to 8 hours of power on your energy bill.\nWhich space heaters are programmable Usually, oil-filled heaters are programmable. But there are also some infrared heaters that are programmable.\nFrom my perspective, the difference between programmable oil and infrared heaters is that oil heaters take more time to heat up and cool down. Through a timer, you have better control over these “delayed” heating times. Infrared heaters, on the other hand, heat up and cool down as soon as you flick the power switch. There’s oftentimes not really a need to program them.\nWhich space heaters are not programmable Aside from the rather few programmable space heaters, most heaters are not programmable.\nThis includes common electric heaters such as infrared heaters, but also oil heaters, and propane heaters.\nNon-programmable heaters are always a good choice when they are not your primary heat source and you want to be able to program heating periods.\nOftentimes, non-programmable space heaters are sufficient. Especially when you just use them for supplement heat.\nNon-programmable space heaters can even be sufficient as primary heat sources. You just need to be patient enough for the room to heat up. This is oftentimes the case in cabins in the woods. There, you don’t have easy access to electricity, so it makes sense to use propane heaters that work independently of electricity and are therefore not programmable. But in a cabin, it doesn’t matter. Usually, you can wait until your cabin heats up\nHow to tell programmable and non-programmable space heaters apart It’s pretty simple to tell programmable and non-programmable space heaters apart. The most straightforward difference is the timer on the front panel of the space heater. Is there a timer dial or a timer button (with a clock face on it)? If yes, that’s an obvious sign that the heater you’re looking at is programmable.\nIf you are still not sure if the heater you’re looking at is programmable, check the product description. Just look it up online. Or even simpler: Turn it on and see if you can program anything. Or get the user manual from the original packaging.\nAnother difference is that non-programmable space heaters are usually (but not always) cheaper than programmable space heaters.\nIf you are still not sure then go the safe route and assume that the heaters you are looking at are not programmable. And look for a model that is. Have a look again at the 3 best programmable space heaters list at the top of this article\nConclusion My favorite programmable space heaters are DeLonghi and Pelonis oil-filled radiators. The reason is that they are safe to set up durable. Oil-filled heaters don’t wear down quickly and last you a long time. Also, they are the safest sort of programmable space heaters. That’s why I intentionally did not include infrared or plain electric heaters in the list.\nUsually, you want a programmable space heater to run in your absence. In this case, I would only trust oil-filled radiators.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-programmable-space-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe’re having a look at the 3 best programmable space heaters.

The weight of an oil heater becomes important when you are moving it frequently. Especially when you get one heater to heat multiple rooms, it is important, that the heater is easy to carry around.\nOn the other side, when you have children or pets at home, having a heavy heater is an advantage. Heavy heaters stand their place and do not tip over as easily as lightweight space heaters.\nIn this article, we’re having a look at the weights of oil-filled radiators and what you can expect when you are buying a new oil-filled radiator.\nQuick answer: An average oil-filled radiator weighs 18.9 pounds. The maximum weight is around 27 pounds. The lightest oil-filled radiator weighs around 8.6 pounds. But the light heater also outputs less heat and draws only 700W power, instead of the regular 1500W. Heavier heaters tend to have higher heat output.\nAs you see, the weight of oil-filled heaters varies quite a bit. And maybe the quick answer was a little too dense information. Let’s break all the info down. I’ll show you how I got all the numbers.\nHow I found the average weight of oil-filled radiators My approach to finding the average weight of oil-filled radiators is simple and easy to reproduce. Instead of purchasing different models and putting all of them on a weight scale, I collected the weight values of 10 different random oil-filled radiators online.\nEach of the heaters had their weight noted on their sales page. Then, I put all the data in an Excel spreadsheet and performed some math magic.\nHere are the oil-filled radiator weight values that I have collected:\nHeater brand****WeightPelonis 14A16.09 poundsKismile18.59 poundsDreo22.2 poundsDe’Longhi26.6 poundsDe’Longhi23.15 poundsAmazon Basics16.72 poundsHoneywell19.7 poundsUnbranded (700W instead of 1500W)8.64 poundsComfort Zone21 poundsAntarctic Star16.46 poundsAverage****18,9 pounds\nThe last row of the table above already depicts the average weight of the oil-filled radiator samples.\nOne of the heaters is a smaller oil heater. It outputs just 700W of heat instead of 1500W. Since it is the only such heater on the list, I wonder what the average weight of a 1500W heater is.\nTo calculate this, I have redone the calculation above but left out the 700W heater. I came to the following conclusion:\nThe average 1500W oil-filled radiator weighs 20 pounds.\nWhy do oil heaters weigh so much? Of all kinds of electric space heaters, oil-filled heaters are the heaviest. This is because they usually have this big metal body that is filled with oil. Both the metal and the oil weigh a lot.\nContrasting the heavy oil-filled radiators, infrared heaters tend to be very light. Infrared heaters rely on an infrared heating element. They do not contain any fluids to distribute the heat.\nInfrared heating elements are very lightweight. But compared to oil-filled radiators they have one disadvantage. The heat they produced is very focused. Think of an infrared heater as a shining lamp. Everything in line of sight is heated, everything else stays cool.\nOil-filled radiators, on the other hand, make use of their weight (through oil and metal bodies), which can distribute the heat evenly. The heavy heating body is a wide source of heat, not a narrow and focused one.\nOil-filled radiator heat retention Due to their high weight, oil-filled radiators have a high heat capacity. This means that oil-filled radiators will retain their heat for some time after turning it off. This comes especially handy when you use the heater for bedroom heating but you don’t want to keep it turned on all night.\nInfrared heaters are very light and do not retain any heat. Within a minute after turning off, they are usually cold. This, of course, also depends on the model. But the one I have at home turns cold almost instantly.\nYet, the same applies the other way around: Since oil-filled heaters weigh more, they also need more time to heat up, whereas lightweight heaters start producing heat almost instantly.\nOil-filled radiators need more time because the electric heating element that is encapsulated in the metal heating body first needs to heat the oil. This takes some time. Usually 5-10 minutes. But after that, oil-filled radiators are reliable, safe, and durable sources of heat.\nThe weight of an oil-filled radiator is a safety advantage But not only the heat retention benefits from the increased weight of an oil-filled radiator. Oil-filled radiators also provide better safety since they are much harder to tip over than regular electric space heaters.\nThis is especially a concern when you have pets or children at home.\nA space heater tipping over can damage the floor or hurt somebody. In the worst case, it can cause a fire.\nUsually, the latter doesn’t happen, since most modern space heaters have tip-over protection. But you still don’t want to risk it.\nOil-filled radiators are heavy and need significant force to tip over. The force required to tip over an oil heater is big enough to ensure that it can’t happen by accident.\nThe infrared space heater I have at home is so lightweight, that when I pull the carpet it’s standing on just lightly, it falls over. Usually, you shouldn’t place infrared heaters on carpets. In this case, it was just for the experiment.\n“The advantage (IMO) of non-oil-filled is that they are usually significantly lighter in weight, and they cannot leak oil.”\ntriffic from the vwt4forum\nWeight and big surface protect from overheating Another advantage of the high weight of an oil-filled radiator is the big weight and surface area. Since oil heaters are filled with oil (which is the main source of the weight) it is very hard for the electric heating element embedded in the oil-filled body to overheat.\nBefore an overheating can potentially occur, the heating element would have to produce enough heat to boil the entire body of oil. This is impossible with a regular wall outlet.\nOil-filled radiators are very hard to overheat. The oil absorbs all the heat from the heating element.\nIn comparison to lightweight infrared heaters, this is another advantage. Infrared heating elements heat up quickly. Because of these quick heat changes, the heating elements wear down much faster than those of oil-filled radiators.\nOil-filled radiators are durable. All thanks to their weight.\nWeight is not too important If you think about it, weight is not even that important. Even heavy oil-filled radiators are easy to move around. Everyone should be able to do it. Nearly all oil-filled radiators have wheels. Rolling them around the house is easy. As long as you don’t have to surpass steps, weight is not a factor you need to consider.\nOnly when you regularly change floors the weight of an oil-filled radiator becomes important.\nIt might also be a factor if you are young and move homes often. But once you are settled and your heater has a place, the weight is only an advantage.\nConclusion An average oil-filled radiator weighs 18.9 pounds. The high weight ensures safety and durability. A check across 10 different oil-filled radiators resulted in a minimum weight of 8.64 pounds and a maximum weight of 26.6 pounds.\nDue to their high weight, oil-filled radiators are more reliable but also harder to move around. As long as your heater has its place to heat and you don’t constantly need to carry it around, the weight shouldn’t be an issue for you.\nIf you want to learn more about oil-filled radiators and heaters in general, check out all the other articles here on heatertips.com!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-much-does-an-oil-filled-radiator-weigh/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow much does an oil-filled radiator weigh?

Does an electric oil radiator run out of oil? Luckily, this question is easy to answer.\nQuick answer: No, oil heaters do not need to be filled. An oil heater should never run out of oil. The metal heating body has no openings. Since it is a closed system, the oil cannot leak. At least as long as the heater is undamaged and in a good condition. However, yes a damaged heater can run out of oil. In this case, you should replace the heater. An oil heater that runs out of oil is not a reliable and safe source of heat.\nThis was the quick answer. But let’s have a closer look, in case you are still a little confused.\nDo you have to refill an oil heater? I am assuming we are talking about electric oil heaters. The mobile kind of space heaters that you can move around the house and plug in wherever you like. With oil heater, in this article, we are not referring to the big central oil heating systems which are oftentimes the primary heat sources of houses. At least they are where I live.\nIn a mobile oil heater, the heat is not produced from the oil. This is a common misunderstanding! The heat is generated by an electric heating element. The oil does not burn to produce heat. The oil must just be present to propagate and distribute the heat from the electric heating element to the metal surface of the heater. The electric heating element gets very hot. The oil distributes the heat from this small, dangerous, and very hot heating element to the big metal surface. Because of the big surface area of the metal body, oil heaters are safe to touch. This is the reason I consider an oil heater the safest kind of heater. It does not expose any dangerous heating elements.\nWhy is oil used inside an oil-filled radiator? Some people then wonder: Why do oil heaters need to use oil? If it does not serve as a fuel, then we could replace the oil with water and build water-filled heaters. Let me walk you through why exactly oil-filled heaters need oil instead of any other fluid.\nImagine you are an engineer and your task is to develop a device that can heat a room. At hand, you have an electric heating element. One requirement for your heater is to heat safely. The heater should not introduce any safety hazards into a household.\nAn engineer knows that when you have a single hot source of very high temperature, that is very dangerous. Therefore you can’t just plug the heating element into your wall outlet and be fine.\nOil is a very safe fluid to distribute heat To produce safe heat, the heat has to be transferred from the hot heating element to a bigger surface. Increasing the surface means reducing the temperature, even though the provided heating energy stays the same. Big warm areas are better and safer than small, hot points.\nNow, the first idea would be to use water. You can build a metal body that contains water. Inside the water-filled body, you put the heating element. The heating element heats the water and the water, in turn, heats the metal surface. Sounds reasonable, right?\nYet, there is a big downside to this water-based setup. The problem is that water boils very fast. In physic’s terms one could say that the volume of water increases rapidly with rising temperature. This means the hotter the water is, the more space it wants to occupy.\nThis would put the water body under very high pressure.\nIf the smallest thing goes wrong, for example the space heater tipping over and hitting a sharp edge, or the metal body having small imperfections in the metal surface, there is a high risk of explosion. The space heater will pop just as a balloon does when too much air is inside. This is a severe safety hazard and that’s the reason, water is not suitable for use inside heating bodies.\nOil is safer and lighter than water and therefore a better filling for heaters Instead, we use oil. But why? The answer is simple. Oil is basically a safer version of water. While both water and oil are fluid and good conductors for heat, oil has one advantage:\n“The boiling point of diathermic oil is three times higher than water, so it can absorb more heat without subjecting the unit to the same amount of internal pressure. This allows oil-filled space heaters to be lightweight and portable.”\nnewair.com\nIn simple terms, oil does not boil as fast as water does. If you’ve ever observed oil boiling in a frying pan, you know that the pan is way too hot. At these temperatures, the water would already have evaporated.\nTherefore, oil does not turn into an explosive when it is heated inside an enclosed metal body. Yes, the pressure increases with temperature also when you use oil. But it is not comparable to water at all.\nAdditionally, remember the saying “Fat swims”? Or have you ever seen the experiment of oil swimming on top of water? That’s because oil is lighter than water. So, oil is also from a logistics standpoint the better choice. Oil heaters are heavy, no question. But if you filled those heaters with water instead, they would be really hard to move around. Water is just so impracticably heavy.\nOil heaters are more convenient in all areas.\nCan oil heaters run out of oil? Since oil heaters have an oil-filled metal body that is fully enclosed, the heater can’t run out of oil. Therefore, oil heaters never need to be refilled. Remember: The oil inside the metal body is not the source of heat. And also the oil is not burned. Oil is just a transport medium for the heat generated by the electric heating element.\nAn oil heater can only run out of oil if it is damaged and the metal heating body starts leaking oil.\nIn this case, it is not possible to repair the damage. Or rather: anything is possible, but a repair is not worth it since the fix costs more than getting a new heater. I guess to fix a leaking metal body, you would have to weld the leak. And then you would have to ensure that the weld is oil-proof. And you’d also have to ensure that there are no other leaks. A repair doesn’t make sense for most people.\nIn case your oil heater leaks, I would recommend you get a new heater. View my favorite recommended oil-filled radiator here (click the link to view it)\nWhat to do when your oil heater loses oil Even though we just found that oil heaters generally don’t lose oil because they are an enclosed system, you might still feel like your oil heater loses oil. Normally, this should not happen, but let’s troubleshoot the issue and find out together if your oil heater really loses oil.\nFirst, you have to let the oil-filled radiator cool down. This is to let the oil settle and to be able to safely handle the heater. Also, letting the heater cool down will lower the pressure in the metal body.\nTry to shake your heater. You should hear oil moving around. Do you think the amount of oil reduced compared to when the heater was new?\nLet’s do an experiment. Put your heater on a scale to weigh it. Note the weight. Wait for 1-2 weeks. Then weigh it again. Did the weight change? If yes, this means that your heater leaks oil.\nCheck if there are any oil stains around the heater. And also check the heater surface. Can you find any leaks? If you find oil stains somewhere, this is a sure-fire sign your heater lost oil.\nOtherwise, if your heater weight reduces, but you can find no oil stains, that might be a sign of oil evaporating. This is harder to detect.\nIn all cases, getting a new oil heater is the best decision. Not only do leaking oil heaters have lower heating efficiency. They are also a safety risk since less oil is present to distribute the heat.\nConclusion As long as your oil heater is of decent quality and is running reliably, it should never ever run out of oil. The oil is enclosed in a metal body where it can not escape from. Also, the oil is not burned as a fuel but merely used as a transport medium for heat. This is why the oil is never used up and why oil heaters never need to be refilled.\nIf you think that your oil heater leaks, but you are not really sure about it, you can weigh it and check the weight difference within 1 or 2 weeks. If the weight of the heater changes, it likely loses oil.\nUnfortunately, when your oil heater leaks oil, it is always the best decision to replace it with a new high-quality oil-filled radiator that will last you for years ahead. Trying to repair faulty heaters is not worth it.\ncredits: title image by quadZe\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/do-oil-heaters-need-to-be-refilled/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you’re just getting into oil-filled radiators, you might wonder if oil heaters need to be refilled?

To answer this question, I could measure just the heat-up time of my own wood stove for you and give you the numbers. However, that is not the best way to get accurate numbers. Your home is different than mine and therefore your numbers will vary. To find accurate numbers I have collected stove heat-up times from various people around the web and compiled them in this article.\nQuick answer: A wood stove takes an hour to heat your home by 5-10F. It takes approximately 3-6 hours depending on the house and insulation to reach the final temperature. If your wood stove is your primary heat source, you should kindle the fire at least 3 hours before you need a comfortable temperature. But if your wood stove is supplementary heat, you can kindle it 1 hour before you need it and be comfortable. Depending on the outside temperature the final temperature is usually around 65F up to 75F.\nIf you are still interested, how I got to these numbers, keep on reading.\nHow fast do wood stoves heat up? To find out how fast (or slow) wood stoves heat up I looked up the heat-up times of stoves of various people online. I found the best data from a discussion on the heating-related hearth forum in a discussion of how long it takes to warm up the house. Of course, different people reported different numbers.\nHere’s the data I found. The heat-up speeds (in Fahrenheit per hour) of different houses that use wood stoves are\n5F per hour 10F per hour (reported by the same guy, but regarding a different house) 6F per hour 10F per hour up to 20F per hour As you can see, there’s a broad range from 5F per hour up to 20F an hour. The higher the number, the faster the home heats up.\nOf course, the temperatures don’t rise like this infinitely. The heat-up rates listed are first-hour heating rates. They represent the rise in temperature within the first hour after lighting a wood stove. In the proceeding hours, the heat-up rate drops and eventually comes to a halt. This effect is called saturation. The temperature can’t increase after reaching a certain point.\nThe reason for saturation is that the warmer your house gets, the more heat it will lose through insulation. At a certain point, the heat energy generated by the stove equals the heat energy leaving the house and the temperature can’t increase anymore.\nIf you want to increase the heating rate or the final temperature to be reached, you have to input more energy by burning more wood.\nWhen to kindle the fire? Personal philosophy: The time to light the fire should depend on how much you depend on the wood stove to provide you with heat. Is your wood stove your only source of heat? Then light it well in advance before you need it. For example, if you leave the house for work you should light the fire such that when you arrive home, your home is already well heated.\nHowever, if your primary heat source is not the wood stove (for example a central oil heating system), then you do not depend on the wood stove heat. You can then light the fire 1 hour before you need comfortable temperatures. This could be the case if you want a comfortable evening in front of the TV but your home is already heated to a base temperature by your primary heat source.\nWood stove heat-up time factors The time it takes for a wood stove to heat your home depends on several factors. In the first section, you saw the various temperature increase rates of different people. The rates range from 5F to 20F per hour. Where does this difference come from?\nIn the following sections, we are looking at the factors that determine how fast your home heats up.\nThe size of your home One of the biggest factors is the size of your home. Small houses heat up a lot faster than big houses. Similarly, small saunas heat up faster. And small pots of water boil faster than big ones.\nYou can increase the time your wood stove needs to heat up, by reducing the effective area to be heated. This is as simple as closing your living room door. With an open door, the effective heating area is your living room plus all rooms connected to it. With a closed door, the effective heating area is just the area of your living room.\nTherefore, determine whether you want to heat your whole house or just your living room. You can control where the heat goes by opening and closing the doors and guiding the heat. More often than not you want a warm living room and cool bedrooms. So, closed doors are the best solution.\nOutside temperature The colder it is outside, the greater the heat-up rate of your wood stove. What? Yes! Cold homes increase in temperature much quicker than warm homes. The reason is that they are in an earlier stage of the temperature saturation curve. However, for the same reason, cold homes take longer to reach the final temperature. The colder it is outside, the earlier you should kindle the fire.\nInsulation “We have a poorly insulated house. [Our] wood stove heats the first floor to about 70[F] in a couple of hours.”\nmfglickman on hearth.com\nObviously, the heat-up time of a house using a wood stove depends heavily on the insulation. The better insulated a house is, the more heat it retains inside its walls. Poorly insulated homes lose lots of heat energy and therefore need more time to heat up as well as more wood to burn.\nSmall side fact: Most of the heat is lost through the roof. If your attic is not insulated properly, your home will lose heat. Even if the walls are well insulated.\nInsulation is a driving force for home heating. Aside from the source of heat itself, it is the main factor determining how much effort (time, money, energy) you have to put into heating. Upgrading your home’s insulation is oftentimes worth it and will save you money in the long run. And, of course, your wood stove will heat well-insulated walls a lot quicker than poorly insulated walls.\nStructure of the house One user in a heating forum reports living in a house, where half of the house is old and the other half is new\n“With our old 40,000 BTU gas insert and the fan on high, I could run it all evening and barely see a change of 2 - 3 degrees after 4 - 6 hours. [\u0026hellip;] In the newer half, we can drive the temperature from 62F up to 70F in a little over an hour.”\nAshful on hearth.com\nOftentimes, this goes hand in hand with insulation. While insulation determines how much “heat penetrates the walls”, the structure of your home determines “where the warm air goes”. Big, open rooms take longer to heat up than small rooms.\nIf you have an open fireplace in your home, keep in mind that hot air can leave through the chimney. Also consider air gaps below doors, where cold air can leak through.\nConclusion For most modern-day uses, 3 hours of heating are enough to warm your home. At the very least, your living room will be cozy and warm, while the rooms in the back (bedrooms, etc.) will be cooler.\nIf you want instant heat, I recommend looking into infrared space heaters. As soon as you turn on an infrared heater, it produces heat. It has next to no heat-up time. At maximum, it takes 1 minute.\nYou can check my favorite infrared heater here(click here to view it). Infrared heaters are perfect saviors if you are waiting for your primary heat source to heat up, but you are already shivering and need another source of warmth!

However, troubleshooting the issue is not too hard. You can find out the reason for the repeated shutoffs even if you are an electronics layman.\nIn this article, I am going to guide you through 5 different causes of your problem and I am going to present you a potential solution for every case. So, without wasting too much time, let’s get right into it and have a look.\nMost often, space heaters turn off when they overheat or when they don’t receive the power they need. The challenge is to find out the reason for the overheating or the power supply issues.\nDon’t worry, solving the problem is simpler than you think!\nQuick answer: Oftentimes space heaters keep shutting off when there’s an electronic fault in the circuitry. You can test that by bringing your space heater over to a friends’ house and see if it works there. If it keeps shutting off, the defect is in the space heater. Else if it works at your friend’s house, but not at your home, the defect is in your home power supply. If your space heater is defective, it is best and safest to buy a new one. If your home power supply is defective, you should hire an electrician to have a check.\nReplace or repair a space heater that keeps shutting off Before we’re troubleshooting the technical issue itself, I want to introduce you to my personal philosophy when it comes to space heater problems. Generally, space heaters are dangerous products. Ideally, they should run smoothly without you having to worry about anything. When you buy a space heater, I expect that when you turn it on, it produces safe heat. As soon as you turn it off, it stops producing heat.\nIf you are neither familiar with electronics nor you are a hobby home craftsman, you should simply replace the heater. Space heaters that keep shutting off indicate that something is going wrong. And you don’t want to run heat-producing devices where you know that they don’t work reliably all the time.\nThink of it like that: What’s the best outcome that can turn out after you detected the reason for the space heater shut-offs and you are able to repair the issue yourself? In the best case, you save $50-$200 that you would need to come up with for buying a new heater.\nBut what is the worst outcome? In the worst case, there are still undetected side defects or you did not properly repair the heater. The heater turns into a safety hazard and burns your house down.\nMy advice is, therefore: Get a new heater. The cost of replacing your defective heater with a quality product is lower than building a new home or even injuring a family member. For reliable home heating, I am trusting my favorite affordable infrared heater (click here to view it). You should check it out as well!\nIf you’re still interested in causes and fixes, keep reading. I’ll still give my best to help you.\nDusty air filter causes overheating If your heater has an air filter, you should check it. Is there lots of dust covering the air filter? A dusty air filter is one of the most common reasons for space heater shutdowns. It blocks the airflow and therefore heat accumulates inside your heater causing it to shut down.\nThis only applies to heaters with built-in fans that blow warm air. Not all space heaters have built-in fans. If you are not sure if your space heater has a built-in fan, simply turn it on and listen. Is there a “blowing” wind sound? If yes, then check if you see if there’s an opening where you can pull the air filter out. Otherwise check the manual to see where the filter is located.\nAssuming you found the air filter, have a look at it. Is it dusty?\nWhat to do If yes, clean the air filter by pulling all the dirt off with your fingers. Wear gloves if you are uncomfortable. Or use an old toothbrush to dry-scrub the dust off. You could also use compressed air to blow the fine dust off.\nDo NOT use water to clean your space heater’s air filter! Air filters are covered in dust particles, skin particles, and bacteria. It is a perfect living ground for small, microscopic animals. If you wet an air filter, all the life on it will inevitably flourish. Your space heater will stink really really bad every single time you turn it on. Do you know the smell of old vacuum cleaners? That’s the smell you will get. It happened to me once and I had to get rid of the heater. The smell persisted no matter what I did.\nAdditionally, aside from the smell, the wet cleaned filter will be like an airport for bacteria waiting to be blown into your room. As soon as you turn the space heater on, bacteria will be blasted into your home. That is totally unhealthy.\nOnly dry-clean air filters!\nAfter cleaning your air filter and putting it back into the heater, turn on the heater and see if it works now.\nToo many electric devices plugged in your home’s circuit The fault can also be outside of your heater. It could be in your home’s electric circuit. If too many devices are plugged in simultaneously, they can overload the system. The reason is that home power circuits can only provide a fixed maximum amount of power. When you surpass the maximum allowed power consumption, mostly a fuse will blow. If your home circuit or the fuse is faulty, overconsumption of electric current will lead to underprovision of voltage, causing individual electric devices to fail.\nSince a home circuit is designed to handle a fixed maximum amperage, plugged-in devices should never surpass the limit.\nDifferent houses have different power limits. The ampere ratings can range from 100A for small homes up to 250A for bigger homes.\n“100-amp service provides enough power for a small home without electric heating. [\u0026hellip;] In large homes, 250-amp or larger service capacity may be needed, particularly if the home has electric heating”\nthespruce.com\nNow note that the quote above highlights the usage of electric heating. Using an electric heater has a significant impact on the electric current drawn from your home power supply.\nNow let’s test this potential cause of failure at your home. Unplug a few large electricity consumers. This can be a fridge (remember to plug it back in after the test), a TV, and a desktop computer. Now plug in your electric space heater. Turn it on and observe whether it still turns off.\nIf it still turns off, you can say that the issue is not in your electric home circuit. If your heater is running fine now, call an electrician to check the circuitry for you. He will know best how to fix this problem.\nBy the way: If you don’t trust your home electric circuit to handle your electric space heater, it could be an option for you to switch to a propane heater that does not need electricity (click to see my favorite one).\nYour home power supply is too weak The same principle as above applies to weak power supplies. In the previous section, the potential issue was that your home circuit is working fine, but too many devices are plugged in.\nIn case of a weak home power supply, your home circuit is not providing enough power even though you don’t have too many devices plugged in.\nFrom a technical standpoint, both of these cases are the same. In both cases, your space heater does not receive enough power and shuts off.\nAlso, in this case, it is best to have an electrician check this for you who can measure the wall outlet power available. If you can’t afford an electrician, another way to test this is to bring your space heater over to a friend’s or family member’s home. Test your space heater there and see if it still keeps shutting off.\nLoose contact in wall outlet causes space heater to shut off If your wall outlet has a loose contact, your space heater will shut off occasionally. Luckily, this is very easy to test.\nSimply plug your space heater in another wall outlet and check if it is running properly there. If your space heater runs continuously without shutting off while plugged into another outlet, you are guaranteed to have the case. The fault is in your outlet. Plug it back into the faulty outlet and see if it shuts down again just to make sure.\nYou can hire an electrician to get the loose contact in your power supply fixed. This shouldn’t be too expensive. If you are someone who likes to fix stuff on his own, look up how to install wall outlets online and see if any of the contacts in your wall outlet are loose.\nI found this video very helpful:\n\u0026amp;ab_channel=ShaunBranigan\nHow to replace an electrical outlet - You can use this video to check if your wall outlet is properly installed.\nYour space heater stands on an uneven or too soft surface Most space heaters have built-in tip-over protection. Tip-over protection is a security feature that automatically shuts off the heater when it tips over. A heater that tips over, for example, because of a pet or a child running against it, is a serious fire threat for your home.\nOftentimes that tip-over protection is a simple button at the bottom of your heater. The button has a longish shape. It touches the floor. If the button is pressed down (eg. by the floor), the heater assumes to be standing upright. If it is not pressed, the heater thinks it is tipped over and shuts off.\nThe black button you see at the bottom of this infrared space heater is the tip-over protection. When the space heater stands on the floor, the button is pressed down. When it tips over, the button is released causing the space heater to shut off.\nIf your heater stands on uneven or soft ground, the tip-over protection button may not be fully pressed, falsely leading the heater to believe it is tipped over.\nFor very sensitive heaters on uneven grounds, even a person walking past the heater could cause the tip-over protection to trigger. This can also happen if the tip-over protection is using a so-called accelerometer: A sensor measuring acceleration. When the heater senses movement, it shuts off. This can also happen by someone stomping past the space heater or a pet bumping into the heater if the sensor is too sensitive.\nThe automatic shut-off of the space heater, of course, should not be triggered by such small impacts. Faulty sensors can also cause repeated space heater shut-offs.\nHow to test it You can easily test the tip-over protection by tapping the space heater when it is turned on. Does it turn off when you tap it? If yes, the fault is in the tip-over protection.\nIf your heater stands on uneven or too soft ground, a simple fix is to place it on a solid, even surface.\nElse if the issue persists, it is usually best, to get a new heater. Faulty electronics are hard to detect and it requires professional knowledge.\nConclusion Oftentimes you can find the reason for your space heater shutting off by trying out different wall outlets, cleaning the air filter, or placing it on a different surface. Once you found the issue, however, it is usually the best solution to replace your space heater. When the issue is inside your space heater, I would not recommend trying to fix up the electronics. The risk of something going wrong is too high compared to saving the $50-$200 for a new space heater.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/space-heater-keeps-shutting-off/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen a space heater keeps shutting off, you often don’t know what to do.

But is it worth getting one? The initial cost of getting an insert confuses most people. Will the upfront costs ever be covered? In this article, we will look at the initial costs of a wood stove insert and the long-term savings. To do this, we will have to look at the efficiency of wood stove inserts. Also, we have to understand how much maintenance such an insert needs. I am going to do the research for you and let you know all my findings!\nQuick answer: Yes, wood stove inserts are worth it. You can expect a $4,500 wood stove insert (including installation) to pay for itself within 3 years. After that, it will continue to save you money for a lifetime. Since wood stove inserts are made of durable steel, they will likely last for decades, if not forever.\nWhat is the purpose of a wood stove insert? A wood stove insert is a steel insert that will transform your existing fireplace into a stove.\nIt is commonly known that stoves are much more heating efficient than traditional fireplaces. This makes a wood stove insert a reasonable choice if your primary use of your fireplace is to heat your home. Traditional open fireplaces are highly inefficient in regards to heating because most of the hot air produced is rising up the chimney. This means you are effectively heating the air outside instead of your own home. The biggest advantage of a wood stove insert is that it employs the existing fireplace structure you have in your home. There is no need to remodel your home or remove your fireplace. The insert reuses your existing fireplace and the chimney.\nWood stove inserts transform existing fireplaces into stoves with minimal work needed.\nIf you decide to install a new stove instead, you have to deal with problems such as deciding if you should break down and remove the existing fireplace. And then you have to refurbish your living room.\nSounds like too much work? Get a wood stove insert.\nCost of wood stove inserts Now that we know what a wood stove insert is and what it is used for, let’s have a look at how much it costs. I have found three different sources. As expected, all of them give different numbers.\nAccording to homeguide.com, you can expect to pay $1,200 to $3,400.\nAnother website presents the following numbers:\n\u0026ldquo;Most fireplace inserts and a professional installation cost about $2,000 to $4,000, depending on the state of your existing chimney and the model you select. Some electric models cost significantly less, but they offer less heat output than wood and gas fireplace inserts.”\nthisoldhouse.com\nAccording to homeadvisor.com, the cost of a fireplace insert can be below $2,000. But installing new chimney liners adds to the cost. The average homeowner can expect an additional $2,500 of installation costs for a new chimney liner. However, this additional cost depends on the materials used and, of course, the quality of work. You can expect aluminum chimney liners to be significantly cheaper than cast-in-place chimney liners. Both solutions will get the job done. However, the cast-in-place chimney liner will likely last a lot longer.\nWhen it comes to money calculations, I am more the kind of person that makes pessimistic assumptions. In the course of my life so far, this has proven a good decision. Let’s, therefore, assume the rather higher end of the price spectrum: Let\u0026rsquo;s assume $4,500 for a wood stove insert and chimney liner plus installation. For that price, you can expect to get a good fireplace insert, of course also with delivery, and everything is done for you from start to finish.\nWhy you need a chimney liner as well Usually, with the decision to get a wood stove insert, you’ll also need to consider getting a new chimney liner. Both go hand in hand. Remember your main goal is to increase the efficiency of your heat source.\nWith a wood stove insert, you are effectively downsizing the burning volume of your fireplace. The space the wood has available reduces. Because of this reduced size, your chimney has to be adapted.\nAside from being responsible for exhausting toxic gases, your chimney has a second, less known job. Due to the chimney effect (or stack effect), taller and narrower chimneys “pull” more air than smaller and wider chimneys. It’s similar to the air pull you notice standing next to a nearly closed door. The reduced size of the wood stove insert, as compared to the former fireplace, causes less convection (less hot air rising). This in turn limits the ignitability of the fire. To produce lots of heat in a small stove chamber, you need a constant airflow. A chimney liner produces this airflow by making use of the chimney effect. It narrows the diameter of the chimney, causing the air to enter your stove with higher pressure.\nAs your chimney was likely designed with a big fireplace in mind, its wide diameter is not suitable for smaller inserts. The chimney liner ensures proper airflow and a balanced wood-burning rate. A certified chimney sweeper will know how to choose the proper dimensions for your chimney liner to ensure the highest heat efficiency.\nHow energy efficient are wood stove inserts? According to studies, traditional fireplaces are only 5% efficient. This means that 95% of the potential heat energy goes straight out of the chimney. Your fireplace produces lots of smoke, which hints at the inefficient burning of wood particles. Only 5% of the heat produced, is actually used to heat your house.\nAfter installing a wood stove insert, you can expect heating efficiencies up to 80%+. Only 20% of potential heat energy is wasted. By the way: 100% efficiencies are physically impossible. Anything above 80%+ is already really good. The reason is that perfect insulation does not exist and some heat will always be wasted by going straight into the ground or penetrating through the walls or somewhere else you don’t need it.\n80% heating efficiency is a really nice result!\nWhy are wood stove inserts more efficient? Oftentimes, the question arises as, why wood stove inserts are so efficient. Here’s the answer. The insert converts the convection heat (which is essentially hot air rising up the chimney) to radiant heat. Radiant heat doesn’t rise up such as hot air. Radiant heat spreads evenly in your home. It is the form of heat that you feel when you’re sitting in front of a fire and hold your hands against it. Or when you go outdoors in spring and the sun is shining on your face for the first time in the year even though the air is still cold. The fire inside the stove heats the steel stove container, which in turn radiates the heat everywhere making it cozy and warm.\nThe heat radiating from the wood stove insert will effectively heat all the objects in your room. The heated up room will then evenly heat the air everywhere and produce convection. See the difference?\nIn a chimney, the hot air leaves straight out of the chimney. An oven, instead, radiates and heats up the objects in your room, which then causes the air to heat up everywhere. Since the warm air is then trapped in your room, it can’t leave anywhere through convection.\nAir is a heat insulator, which is why you feel warmer under thicker blankets as they contain more air pockets. When a traditional fireplace produces hot air, the heat contained does not radiate out as it is surrounded by more air acting as an insulator. Heat can only efficiently be transferred through the air by blowing the hot air into the room, or by radiating the heat waves.\nOf course, fireplaces also produce radiant heat. And wood stove inserts also produce convection heat. The difference is just in the balance of heat forms.\nwood stove insertfireplaceradiant heat**80%**20%convection heat20%80%Efficiencies of a wood stove insert as compared to a fireplace\nHow much money will it save me? To find out how much money the installation of a new fireplace insert will save you, let’s first look at your current cost of heating. Since I don’t know the structure and building materials of your home, all of the following numbers will be estimations. But I’m giving my best at picking reasonable numbers. Let’s have a look.\nI found across various forums that the average wood demand for stove users is 4 cords per year of heating. 1 cord is about 3.6 cubic meters (for our friends in Europe) of wood. There are also differences in how much wood you need depending on the wood you use for heating. Since various sorts of wood have different heating power 1 cord of beech wood will, for example, produce a different amount than 1 cord of spruce wood. But in general, you can assume 4 cords.\nAlso, take in mind that these numbers apply to stove heating only. They do not apply to fireplace heating because fireplaces usually need a lot more wood to burn than a stove. Since we have the efficiency ratings of a fireplace (which is 5% but let’s assume 10% for well-designed fireplaces) and wood stoves (80%), we can easily compare stoves and fireplaces with regards to their wood consumption.\nThe 80% efficiency of a stove is 8 times higher than the 10% efficiency of a fireplace. This means that to produce the same heat, a fireplace needs 8 times the amount of wood.\nLet’s assume you heat only with wood. Therefore you need 4 cords of wood per year when you’re using a wood stove insert. A single cord of wood will cost you approximately $180 depending on your location. This means you’ll pay 4 times $180 equals $720 a year for heating with a wood stove insert.\nTo produce the same amount of heat with a fireplace (which rarely anyone is doing because of low efficiency), you need 8 times the amount of wood. This means you have to cover 8 times $720 equals $5,760 of heating costs.\nThis, in turn, means that you will save $5,760-$720 = $5,040 a year if you are purely heating with wood. Your wood stove insert with installation will pay for itself within just one year, since we estimated $4,500 for that.\nObviously, this calculation is rigged. I assume that you use a traditional fireplace to heat your whole house. Also, I assume your fireplace heating wood usage increases to make up for the reduced efficiency of the fireplace. This is rarely the case. Therefore let’s be a little more pessimistic. Let’s assume you’ll save a third of the calculated sum: $5,040 divided by 3 is $1,680. The investment will still pay for itself within 3 years. As long as you are regularly heating with wood, a wood stove insert is always worth it and will pay for itself. A wood stove insert is not worth it if you plan to use it only sporadically, eg. when guests are around or only on weekends.\nDoes a wood stove insert need maintenance? Yes, a wood stove insert needs maintenance. However, the maintenance involved is not much more than for maintaining a traditional fireplace. If you don’t currently heat with wood, here’s the maintenance tasks you will have to face:\nFirst, the wood itself needs work. You need to cut up wood, split it and organize it into cords. You’ll need some gear to do that, such as a splitting maul to split the wood. And you’ll need one or more wood racks to store and dry the wood. Also, you need space to store the wood chopping gear and the wood itself. Additionally, you’ll need fireplace tools and a woodstove glass cleaner. Don’t forget the lighter!\nConclusion If you like to heat with wood, a wood stove insert is always worth it. If you are a “show off heater” who uses the fireplace only occasionally, stick to your fireplace. A wood stove insert is a reliable source of efficient heat. Your fireplace is enough if all you want to achieve is some supply of heat to comfort some guests.\nAdditional credits: shawnredsox808 (title image)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-wood-stove-inserts-worth-it/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWood stove inserts claim to increase the heating efficiency of your fireplace.

Whether it’s broken, too old and unfashioned or you just want to free some space. In this article, we’re going to find out how to dispose of space heaters. For extra detail, I will divide this article into different subsections and explain how to dispose of each individual heater type.\nYou will find out how to dispose of oil heaters, infrared heaters, ceramic heaters and fuel-powered heaters (like kerosene or propane heaters).\nHere’s the short version: If your space heater is mostly plastic, you can dispose of it in your household trash. If your heater is mostly metal, you should bring it to the waste disposal site. And if your heater contains any hazardous materials or oil that you cannot drain, you should bring it to a hazardous waste depot.\nKeep reading to find out more. We will also take a look at where you can find special waste disposal locations so you can recycle them properly.\nThe material of your Space Heater First off, it’s very important to know which materials your space heater is made of. Most space heaters are mostly plastic. But there are exceptions.\nFor example heaters from the Dr. Infrared Heater brand are oftentimes made of wood. And other types of heaters, especially the ones that get really hot, can be made of metal entirely.\nOftentimes, you will also find a mix of materials in your space heater. Some parts are made of metal, some other parts are plastic. If your space heater is mixed material as well, then just look at the material that’s most present for your disposal decision.\nTheoretically, you could also divide the materials and break your space heater down, but that’s lots of effort and trouble. And very likely, you’re going to hurt yourself. Or you risk that some hazardous materials leak. So, I don’t really suggest it.\nHazardous materials in space heaters Sometimes, space heaters contain hazardous materials that have to be recycled properly. So, let’s take a look at which space heaters contain them.\nNon-hazardous materials Most materials space heaters are made of, are safe. You can easily dispose of them. They are plastic, metal, and wood. But you might also wonder about the heating elements of your space heaters.\nFor example, infrared heaters produce their heat using glowing red heating elements. At first, I thought they contain hazardous materials as well. However, as it turned out, infrared heating elements are made of quartz or ceramic. Both of which are safe to dispose of.\nCeramic heaters contain ceramic heating elements as well. Nothing to worry about.\nHazardous materials Let’s talk about a few hazardous materials in space heaters.\nOil in oil-filled heaters When you have a heater that contains oil that you cannot drain, you have to dispose of it properly. Otherwise, it could cause oil pollution, which has a significant environmental impact.\nJust one liter of oil contaminates 1 million liters of water.\n“Oil pollution can have a devastating effect on the water environment, it spreads over the surface in a thin layer that stops oxygen getting to the plants and animals that live in the water.”\noilcare.org\nTherefore, AVOID trashing your oil heater in your home garbage.\nFuel leftovers in fuel-powered heaters This point applies to all fuel-powered heaters. Especially kerosene and diesel heaters. But also gas heaters, like propane or butane heaters.\nMake sure that before you dispose of your space heater, all the fuel is burned off. Now, propane heaters oftentimes use portable gas-tanks as an energy source. So, there won’t be any gas leftovers.\nBut kerosene and diesel heaters require a direct refill within the heater. Please drain the fuel into a tank and use it somewhere else. Or make sure it is burned off.\nWhen you dispose of your fuel-powered heater, it is important that there are no fuel leftovers in it.\nHow to dispose of different Space Heaters Now that we covered the basics of waste removal, we can take a look at how to dispose of space heaters. It is actually not that hard to do. Here’s a small disposal guide for each heater type.\n1. Infrared Heater Infrared heaters are usually made of plastic. They contain electronic boards that you can either take out or simply leave them inside. For safety reasons, I suggest to just leave the electronics.\nNow, because infrared heaters are usually made of plastic, and their heating elements are made of ceramic or quartz, you can get rid of them in your household trash. Ceramic and quartz are both non-hazardous materials.\nIf your infrared heater is mostly metal, you should bring it to a waste disposal depot. But you don’t need to go to a hazardous waste depot.\n2. Electric heater Electric heaters are heaters that heat just using a thin metal wire. The metal wire heats up when current flows through it. So, electric heaters don’t have any complex electronics or heating elements.\nUsually, electric heaters are the heaters you find in cheap electronics or gadgets stores. Because these electric heaters are often in a cheaper price range, they are mostly plastic and thus you can also dispose of them in your household trash.\nCheap heaters are usually the easiest to dispose of.\n3. Ceramic Heater Ceramic heaters are heaters that make use of a ceramic heating element. Most heaters in the mid-price range are ceramic heaters. For example, when you buy a space heater off amazon, it is mostly a ceramic heater.\nCeramic heaters don’t contain any hazardous materials, which is why you can dispose of them safely in your household trash. However, ceramic heaters are oftentimes of a bigger size. So, if you have a big ceramic tower heater, for example, you can also call a bulky waste pickup service.\n4. Oil-Filled Heater Oil-filled heaters are harder to dispose of. Oil heaters are heaters that distribute their heat over a large metal body. That large metal body is filled with oil and permanently sealed. So, it’s impossible to drain the oil without big machinery.\nThat’s why oil heaters are hazardous waste. You cannot trash them in your household trash. Rather you should bring your oil-filled heater to a hazardous waste disposal site. They will take care of it.\nEven though they are mostly metal, you shouldn’t bring oil heaters to a regular waste disposal depot. They might accept it but probably won’t handle the heater properly.\nIf you want to make sure that you can dispose of your oil heater at your depot, just call them and ask. That’s always the best thing to do.\nSome waste disposal depots might accept oil-filled heaters, while others won’t.\n5. Kerosene (or other fuel) Heater Kerosene and other fuel-powered heaters are hazardous waste as well. Especially if they still contain some of the fuel.\nHowever, if you have a propane heater or any other gas-powered heater you can oftentimes trash them at home. Because gas heaters need external gas tanks to run, they usually don’t contain gas themselves. Also, they are mostly made of plastic.\nSo, if you’re sure that your heater doesn’t contain fuel any more you can dispose of it in your household trash.\nConclusion: Space Heater Disposal You can oftentimes dispose of your space heater at home. Ceramic heaters and infrared heaters are always safe to trash at home. Their heating elements don’t contain any hazardous materials.\nHowever, if your heater is mostly made of metal, then you should bring it to a special waste disposal depot or a scrap dealer. You might even get a few bucks for your old heater.\nAnd if you have an oil-filled heater, you have to bring it to a hazardous waste depot.\nBut here’s another idea:\nWhy don’t you just sell your heater online? You would avoid the hassle of bringing it to a waste disposal site and even get money for it.\nAlso, selling used items is environmentally friendly. Things don’t have to be reproduced over and over. And someone else can have fun with a space heater that he got for cheap. There are just so many advantages to selling compared to trashing things.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-dispose-of-a-space-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow to dispose of a space heater.

Does your walk-in closet get super cold as well? I totally understand how you feel. Oftentimes, it’s one of the first rooms you enter in the morning. With a walk-in closet that feels like a teleport to the north pole, you start your day uncomfortably every time.\nIn this guide, we’re going to cover a few basic options to heat a walk-in closet. I will stick to simple solutions. You can implement most of them on your own, without the need for professionals. So, let’s start.\nShort answer: To heat a walk-in closet, you should first identify where the cold comes from. If it comes from an outside wall, you’ll need to improve the insulation of that wall. Oftentimes walk-in closets are limited in space, so you can’t add big heating systems. To improve the heat exchange with your living space, you can install a vented louver door. The best heaters for walk-in closets are underfloor heating and portable electric heaters.\nHowever, there are a lot more points to cover, so keep reading to find out the best way to heat your walk-in closet.\n1. Test where the cold comes from The first step you have to follow is to test, where the heat comes from. You can do so by simply touching the walls. If the outside wall is the coldest part of your walk-in closet, you found the issue. Most likely, the cold is entering your walk-in closet through the outside wall. The best first step to make up for that is to add insulation to that wall. Or maybe even build a second wall, if you live in an old home.\nTouch the floor and see how cold it is. If you think it’s uncomfortably cold, the floor needs insulation as well. Luckily, insulating a floor is easy, as even a simple carpet acts as a layer of insulation. So, add a carpet, if you don’t have one yet.\nIf the air itself is cold, but your living space is not, you need to improve the heat exchange with your living space. Here’s how.\n2. Improve the heat exchange with your living space If the air of your walk-in closet is cold, but your living space is warm, there’s a chance the walk-in closet door blocks of the heat.\nEspecially, when you have a heat source in your living space, but none in your walk-in closet, you need to improve the air exchange. And luckily, there’s a simple, yet elegant solution.\nAdd a vented louver door. That’s a door that allows the air to freely move between both rooms. But it preserves privacy. You can’t see through it.\nSo, whenever you heat your living space, you also heat your walk-in closet. But only add a louver door when you’re sure that the walk-in closet’s outside walls are insulated.\nWhen they’re not the cold air from your walk-in closet will enter your living space. Which will, in turn, increase your heating bills.\nHere’s how to insulate a walk-in closet.\n3. Insulate the outside walls When your walk-in closet has no heat source and no proper insulation, it has no other choice than being cold. The cold enters your walk-in closet and stays there because there is nothing that warms it up. The combination of no insulation and no heat source is nearly always the reason for a cold walk-in closet.\nI suggest to first add insulation to the outside walls of your walk-in closet. With outside walls, I’m talking about the walls that face the outside. You don’t need to insulate walls that face your living space.\nAnyways, go with simple insulation first. For example, you can add thick curtains to your window. If that doesn’t help, then you can make it a bigger project to insulate your walls or hire a professional.\nIn some extreme cases, for example, when you’re living in a very old house, it might even be necessary to add a second wall.\n4. Pick a heat source for a walk-in closet The very best heat source you can have in a walk-in closet is underfloor heating. In a walk-in closet you generally face three problems:\nLack of space Fire hazard Few freestanding walls. The fire hazard results from the number of clothes in your walk-in closet. And oftentimes, especially in small walk-in closets, you don’t have any freestanding walls.\nAll these three points eliminate all heaters that get overly hot. Mainly, because of the safety risks.\nHere are the types of heaters that are best suited for heating a walk-in closet.\nUnderfloor heating Advantages of underfloor heating for a walk-in closet The best choice for heating a walk-in closet is underfloor heating. It is superior to any other heating method, simply because it isn’t affected by the three problems I mentioned above.\nUnderfloor heating is a heat source, mostly hot water pipes, that carry heat below your floor. It doesn’t take up any space. That’s a property that no other heater has. And secondly, it doesn’t get overly hot.\nBecause the heat is distributed over the whole floor, there’s no single spot that gets hot. Instead, underfloor heating provides even heat.\nDisadvantages of underfloor heating “In older buildings creating the right conditions under the floor can take time and cause major upheaval\u0026quot;\novoenergy.com\nUnderfloor heating is generally a very expensive way to heat. Not because of the efficiency of heating, but because it has high upfront expenses. It is difficult to install.\nAdditionally, underfloor heating takes a long time to warm up. So, for heating a walk-in closet in the morning using underfloor heating you’ll also need a smart thermostat that heats your floor before you wake up.\nOtherwise, it would take an eternity to heat.\nAnd you can’t use it under certain types of furniture. Especially the type of furniture that touches the floor with a large area.\nSpace heaters for a walk-in closet Underfloor heating is nice to have. For sure. But the upfront expenses and the effort might not always be worth it. Instead, why not get a simple and safe space heater? Here’s my suggestion.\nAdvantages of space heaters for a walk-in closet Space heaters come in all sizes and shapes, so I’m 100% sure you’ll find one that suits your walk-in closet.\nPortable space heaters beat any other heating source with their heating speed. They can heat incredibly fast. So, you don’t even need to preheat your walk-in closet before you enter it. This helps you save money in the long run.\nAnd space heaters are relatively affordable. Especially compared to the huge efforts underfloor heating requires. You can get good quality space heaters that will last you for many years, if not decades, for very reasonable prices. You can check my space heater recommendation on this Recommended Products page. I only recommend heaters where I’m absolutely sure the quality matches what you pay for!\nDisadvantages of space heaters Space heaters come in many different types. From infrared heaters to oil heaters and ceramic heaters. It can become confusing to decide for the right one, especially if you’re not familiar with the topic.\nThat’s why I suggest checking the Recommended Products page where you can find the single best heater for each heater category (oil, infrared, propane, \u0026hellip;) together with a description where it’s good to use at.\nPS: I recommend to take a look at the infrared heater for your walk-in closet.\nConclusion: How to heat a walk-in closet For heating a walk-in closet, you can choose between installing underfloor heating or using simple space heaters. I recommend space heaters, simply because they don’t require any installation and they are way more affordable than underfloor heating.\nHeating a walk-in closet does not only depend on the right heat source though. It’s also important to have properly insulated outside walls.\nIf your living space warms up nicely, but your walk-in closet stays freezing cold, it is likely that there is no heat exchange between the two rooms. To fix the heat exchange issue, I recommend getting a vented louver door, which allows for the air to go from one room to the other. And louver doors still retain privacy. Perfect for a walk-in closet.\nI hope this article was helpful to you!

After reading this short convection heater guide, you’ll understand how convection heaters work. In my explanations, I’ll stick to a very intuitive level. Let’s just avoid the detailed physics. We all had enough of it in school.\nHere’s the short answer: Convection heaters work using a heating coil that produces hot air. The hot air is then distributed by a fan or by a large metal surface. Convection heaters use the air as a medium to transport the heat. Either they heat up air and then blow it across the room to distribute it. Or they make use of the natural rising of warm air, which ensures that the heat distributes itself. Keep reading to find out more.\nHow a convection heater works: The Basics Convection heat is not hard to understand. Convection is the scientific term for “movement of air” (or any other gas). So, convection heat is all about heating a room using the natural movement of the air.\nAs you might already know, air rises when it’s warm and drops when it cools down. So, when you have a convection heater in your room, it will pull the cool air and pass it over a hot metal coil to heat it.\nConvection heaters oftentimes use a fan to draw in the cool air and push it out when it is warmed up. But not all types of convection heaters work this way. For example, there are oil-filled radiators that warm the air using their big metal surface. The hot air rises naturally and doesn’t need to be pushed.\nBut when you get a convection heater with a built-in fan: Great. A fan increases the heating speed.\nAs you see, it’s easy to understand convection heat.\nDifference between convection heating and radiant heating To understand convection heating even better let’s compare it with radiant heating. Both types of heating are very popular. Here are the key differences:\nHeating speed Radiant heaters work in a completely different way than convection heaters. They don’t heat the air. They use radiation to heat up objects directly. The heat is transferred using radiation instead of convection.\nThat’s why radiant heaters are much faster than convection heaters. They don’t heat the air first. They heat the object they’re pointed at directly and immediately.\nIn contrast, convection heaters are a little slower. To heat a room, they first need to heat the air in that room. As a result, radiant heating is better if you want quick heating.\nBut if you don’t care about whether your room is warm within a minute or five, then convection heaters are fine.\nHeat Retention Convection heaters heat the air. That’s why when you turn them off, the air will stay warm for a few more hours. Obviously the heat doesn’t disappear right away.\nIn contrast, infrared heaters lose their heat nearly immediately after you turn them off.\nSo, if you want to have a heater that can keep your bedroom warm overnight, then a convection heater is the better choice. It retains the heat for much longer.\nEfficiency Convection heaters and radiant heaters are efficient in different scenarios. Each type of heater is very efficient if you use it the right way.\nInfrared heaters are most efficient if you use them to heat just certain spots in a room. Radiant heat is directional heat, so you can influence where the heat is going. That’s why infrared heaters can keep you warm in a very large room. Because they don’t use any energy for heating the whole room, but just the spot where you are.\nInfrared heat is 40% more efficient than any other type of heater when you want to heat only certain spots in a room (e.g. you and your spouse on the living room couch).\nMeanwhile, convection heaters are much better for keeping a whole room warm. Convection heaters heat the air in the whole room and the natural movement of air ensures that the heat reaches every corner.\nThat’s why convection heat is best for heating whole rooms.\nComfort There’s even a difference in comfort when you pick radiant heat instead of convection heat. When you use an infrared heater, the heat feels like the sun is shining on your skin. However, the side of your body that’s facing the heater is warmer than the opposite side.\nConvection heaters distribute their heat evenly and that’s why I find them much more comfortable.\nSome people say convection heaters dry out the air. And yes, it’s true in some way. By heating the air, the relative humidity drops and the air feels drier. But you can easily compensate for that. Check this article to learn how: 3 Space Heaters that don’t dry the air\nNoise Convection heaters have to distribute the heat using convection. Oftentimes, to speed up the heating, they come with a built-in fan that blows warm air into the room. That is one of the reasons convection heaters are among the loudest heaters. However, oil heaters or other convection heaters which distribute the heat using the natural rising of warm air, don’t cause any noise. Because they don’t have a built-in fan, they are the quietest space heaters.\nAs you see, with convection heaters you get many choices. Either you pick models with a fan which oftentimes gives you faster heating speeds but more noise. Or you pick a model without a built-in fan that heats a little slower, but absolutely quiet.\nIn contrast, infrared heaters are mostly quiet. But when they run on full power, they can also produce noise. Infrared heater use infrared heating elements to produce radiant heat. If they run on lots of power, they can start buzzing or humming.\nIf you need an absolutely quiet heater, oil heaters (which belong to the group of convection heaters) are always the best idea.\nLight Some heaters produce light. Especially infrared radiant heaters. They usually heat using infrared heating tubes. To produce the heat, these heating tubes first have to heat up to a point where they glow red.\nSo, all radiant heaters glow.\nIn contrast, convection heaters oftentimes don’t. Yes, there are some convection heaters where you can see a glowing hot heating coil. But mostly the heating coil is hidden inside the body of the heater.\nSo, if you want to heat overnight, and you prefer to have a dark room, then stick with convection heaters. They heat “invisibly”.\n“Convection heaters are popular for when instant heat is required, as they quickly create a warm air current that can be felt the moment the heater is switched on.”\nelectricradiatorsdirect.co.uk\nTypes of convection heaters Generally, four different types of heaters belong to the group of convection heaters.\nWall-mounted convection heaters for your home: Mostly for bedrooms and other living spaces. Wall-mounted convection heaters, like panel heaters, are often used for whole-room heating or even commercial applications. Portable or wall-mounted heaters with built-in fans: Portable space heaters are heaters you can place anywhere you like. Oftentimes they’re a temporary heating solution. Wall-mounted heaters are more of a permanent heating solution. But basically, they’re just the same as portable space heaters, except you mount them to a wall. The heat is still produced within the heater and not by a central heating system. Oil heaters: Oil heaters distribute the heat using a large metal surface. The oil acts as a heat reservoir and retains the heat, so it keeps heating even after you shut it off. Oil heaters are among the safest types of heaters. Central furnace heaters: Central furnace heaters are all heaters that don’t produce heat on their own. They are connected to the central heating system using pipes or ducts, which supplies the central heaters with hot water or gas. Central heating can be powered by different energy sources: Mostly they are either gas, fuel or oil. Conclusion: How do Convection Heaters work? Convection heaters make use of the natural movement of hot air. They are, in fact, one of the most intuitive ways to heat. It’s similar to when people heated with fires (which is radiant heat), and then they found out that you can heat much more efficiently using a wood stove (which is convection heat).\nConvection heaters are a very basic approach to heating. But that’s a good thing. They are less prone to errors and they are very cost-effective. Convection heaters also come in all shapes and sizes. From big tower heater that heats entire living spaces to small desk heaters that keep just your hands warm.\nBecause convection heaters are easy to produce they are also very affordable.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s check out the Recommended Products page.

When it’s freezing cold, you have to be prepared. So, that’s actually a good question. Whether you’re doing survival, you spend a few nights in your off-grid cabin, or whether your room heater just broke. Heating with candles is definitely a thing that comes to your mind.\nWhen my radiator stopped working, the question about heating with candles popped into my head. When I started my research, I was SHOCKED. There are dozens, if not hundreds of tutorials online about building a candle heater at home.\nSo, that’s what I tried to do myself. Together with a few calculations, I came to a conclusion.\nShort version: To heat a room, you need 20 candles. According to research, the heating power of one candle is 80W. Therefore 20 candles are about the equivalent of one 1600W space heater. A candle heat source of 1600W combined is able to heat a room thoroughly. However, having 20 candles in your room is a fire hazard. Let’s cover the better alternatives.\nHow many watts does a candle have? Luckily, I stumbled on a crazy science website with all kinds of different questions and answers. And that’s where I found the power rating of a single candle.\n“The candle was burning 2 thousandths of a gram [of wax] each second which gives us a power of about 80 watts.”\nthenakedscientist.com\nTo find that out, the researchers investigated petroleum-based candles. That’s the kind of wax most candles use. A candle burns about 8g of each and every hour. Now, that would equal around 2.16mg of burned wax per second.\nChemists, of course, know exactly how much energy is stored in different molecules. You can simply look it up online. We know that candles consist of wax. They found that candle wax contains approximately 37 kilojoules of energy per gram.\nNow, it’s easy to work out that a single candle produces 80W of power.\nI’m sorry if that was too many numbers and facts for you. But anyway, now we know exactly how much power a candle has!\nDoes heating with candles make sense? A single candle doesn’t change a lot. Placing three or four on your desk doesn’t do much as well.\nTo get the equivalent heat output of just one single space heater, you would need to light 20 candles. It sounds dangerous to me.\nNow, depending on the size of your candles, they have limited burning time. Small tea candles burn for 3-4 hours, whereas standard-sized table candles last for 7-9 hours.\nThat means that your heating time is limited.\nAnd after a few hours, your candles go out and you have to replace them. Ugh.\nThat doesn’t sound practical at all.\nHere’s the recipe:\nLight 20 candles. Heat for 4 hours. Repeat For heating a single room for 24 hours, you would need 120 tea candles! And if you want to heat an entire home or a cabin, let’s say with 3 rooms, you would need 360 candles!\nNow think about how much that would cost you. And additionally, you have to constantly light and replace new candles.\nIn an absolute emergency, costs don’t matter. But you’ll just use up so many candles. It’s easier to just wear a few extra layers of clothes.\nBy the way, here’s a guide on the 21 cheapest ways to heat a room. And trust me, heating with candles is definitely not one of the cheapest ways (even if you initially think that it could be cheap).\nDo flowerpot heaters increase the heat of a candle? Heating with candles makes no sense. Or rather, it’s possible, but it’s totally impractical and cost-ineffective.\nBut still, there are hundreds of online tutorials about building a DIY candle heater that is both energy-efficient and doesn’t need many candles.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve even written my own extensively researched guide on how to build a clay pot heater, checking different types of candles and pots and seeing which one is best!\nHere’s the basic setup.\nIt basically works like this:\nCandles are placed below an elevated flowerpot. The heat of the candles goes up the hole of the flowerpot and creates suction at the bottom of the heater. This increases the burning rate of the candles a little because they constantly pull fresh oxygen from your room.\nThe flowerpot also acts as heat storage, similar to the metal body of an oil heater. It gets hot and even gives off the heat.\nBut it doesn’t work as well as you think. Here’s why:\nYou only get out what you put in. The candles that are placed below the flowerpot might produce slightly more heat because of the airflow. However, they also burn off faster. A candle can’t create “free heat”. So, you would have to refill it more often.\nAnd in total, you would end up using as many candles as without the flowerpot method.\nIt’s just a fancy idea. The hot flowerpot gives the illusion that you create more heat than using plain candles. But that’s not the case.\nCandle vs. Space Heater: What’s better for room heating? Now that we know that a candle doesn’t really make much sense, we can even go one step further and compare candles with space heaters. What’s better for heating and why?\n1. Efficiency A candle produces 80W of heat. Usually with an efficiency of around 90%. That means that 90% of the released energy is heat, whereas the rest is light. However, as soon as the light strikes a surface, such as a wall, it is also converted to heat, making the overall heating efficiency 100%. If light escapes through windows, the efficiency reduces slightly.\nCandles have a heat efficiency of close to 100%, given that all of the emitted light stays in the room.\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, using a candle to heat is much better than an open fireplace, for example. With a fireplace, most of the heat goes up the chimney. Whereas with candles, the heat stays inside your room. Great!\nBut candles are not any better than regular space heaters. Regular space heaters have similar efficiency. Most of the electricity you put in is converted to heat.\nIn fact, in terms of efficiency, candles can keep up with space heaters.\n2. Heating Capacity Heating capacity is a term that describes the amount of heat that something can put out.\nA candle can only produce very little heat. In fact, it produces a twentieth of what a space heater can produce.\nThe heating capacity of a candle is just enough to keep a tea hot. A space heater can keep a whole room toasty.\nOf course, you can increase the heating capacity by just adding more candles. But that wouldn’t be a fair comparison.\nA single space heater outputs as much heat as 20 candles, which makes it much more suitable for heating rooms.\n3. Ease Of Use When you want to heat a room with candles, you would have to have a large supply of them. You need to replace candles every few hours. Especially when you want to heat throughout the day, you’ll need to care for hundreds of candles simultaneously.\nThe worst thing is that there’s always something going wrong. If you, for example, open the door too harshly, the wind can blow out a few candles. You just constantly have to babysit them.\nCompared to a regular space heater, candles are awful. You can just turn on a space heater and leave it on for hours. You don’t need to replace anything at all.\n4. Safety Candles are a fire hazard. I don’t think there’s anything I need to add to this point. Especially when you have kids and pets at home.\nHowever, in an emergency, and when you have no alternative, you have to use them. I suggest to place them in spots, where kids can’t reach them. And to have a fan running on low to distribute the heat. Then, you are pretty safe. There will be no spots where the heat accumulates. And your kids can’t play around with them.\nSpace heaters are very safe. Most of the accidents that happen with space heaters are caused by misuse. For example, when you try to dry clothes on a space heater. Of course, it overheats and catches fire.\nBut as long as you use a space heater correctly, it’s absolutely safe. Especially nowadays, where they have all kinds of safety features like tip-over protection and automatic shut-off timers.\n5. Power outage Now, some people would say that in a power outage, candles are the last resort to keep your home warm. Yes, that’s right. But only if you’re not prepared.\nThere are space heaters that don’t need any electricity. Propane heaters use propane gas to produce heat. You can just hook up a propane bottle to your propane heater and it will heat for many many hours.\nThe advantage of propane heaters over candles is that propane gas heat is cheaper than candle heat. And propane heaters can output a lot more heat than candles, while still being safe.\nTo get more heat, you can simply increase the heating settings. With candles, you would have to manually ignite more candles.\nI suggest always being prepared for the worst, and a propane heater is essential to keep warm in an emergency.\nMy favorite propane heater is this Mr. Heater Buddy propane heater (click here to view it on amazon).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also written a full review about it (and about its bigger version, the Mr. Heater Big Buddy) here.\nIt’s a model that I would trust even when the world ends. No joke.\nConclusion You need 20 candles to heat a room. However, that doesn’t mean that using candles is a good idea. You will constantly have to refill candles because they burn off every few hours. To heat a room for 24 hours, you will need 120 tea candles. And on top of that, you will constantly need to take care of candles that go out because of the wind.\nHeating with candles is not a practical idea. For emergencies, I’d rather recommend heating using a regular propane heater. It’s just way more effective. You don’t need to constantly change the propane bottle (it lasts for a long time!) and it’s cheaper than buying candles over and over again.\nRead this next, so you can decide which type of heater is best for you: Infrared vs. Oil Heater (21 Pros and Cons)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-many-candles-do-you-need-to-heat-a-room/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow many candles do you need to heat up a room?

Both are completely different products and yet they have something in common: They are meant to keep you warm.\nIf you are not sure which one you should get, this article is for you. We’re going to compare space heaters and electric blankets and find out which one is the better choice for you. This is a very individual choice, so we’ll cover everything you need to know, to make the best decision. Heating with an electric blanket or with a space heater is very different.\nThe main difference between a space heater and an electric blanket is that with a space heater you heat an entire room, while an electric blanket focuses the heat on just one person. This explains why electric blankets are more energy-efficient to use. On the other hand, space heaters are more versatile and durable. A space heater can last you for several years, whereas an electric blanket is prone to break quickly.\nThese are a lot of differences between space heaters and electric blankets. To decide which one is better for you, you absolutely need to read through all of the pros and cons. In the sections below, you can find 21 pros and cons. These are the most important points to answer your question: Space heater or electric blanket?\n1. Weight Space Heater Pro: You can get a space heater in all weight categories. From very light to very heavy.\nElectric Blanket Pro: Nearly always lightweight. But that depends on the blanket material.\nQuick Explanation The weight difference between space heaters and electric blankets is obvious. While one is a heater and weighs much, the other is a blanket and weighs little.\nHowever, that’s not always the case. You can get space heaters in all weight categories, from really light (1 pound), to very heavy (1000 pounds). The really light ones can be even lighter than an electric blanket usually weighs around 2-4 pounds. So, some space heaters can be lighter than an electric blanket.\nHowever, for most heaters and blankets, that doesn’t apply.\nWeight is only important for carrying the thing around. You would only carry light space heaters from one room to another. So, a weight comparison doesn’t really make sense unless you want to bring with you on a trip.\nIn this case: Space heaters and electric blankets can both get light enough to travel with them.\n2. Sleep Space Heater Pro: Warms the whole bedroom.\nCon: Heaters with little functionality draw lots of energy.\nElectric Blanket Pro: Suitable for sleeping.\nCon: Heats just the bed, not the air.\nQuick Explanation For sleeping, I would personally choose a space heater. I prefer the feeling of warm air a lot more than the feeling of a warm bed. However, that’s a very personal choice. What do you like more?\nAlso, energy consumption plays a big role to decide properly. Space heaters do use a lot more energy unless they come with a built-in thermostat and shut-off timer. Here’s the heater that I know is best for sleeping (reviewed): Here’s my review of the only heater you need for sleeping (click to view it).\nAn electric blanket is also only suitable for sleeping when it comes with a built-in shut off timer function. Otherwise, it would overheat your bed and get uncomfortable. Whenever it gets too hot at night, you wake up and interrupt your sleep.\nThis point goes to space heaters.\n3. Heating Speed Space Heater Pro: Heating speed depends on the heater type. Infrared Heaters heat immediately.\nCon: Oil heaters need a few minutes to heat.\nElectric Blanket Con: Electric blankets need some time to warm up.\nQuick Explanation The heating speed of space heaters depends entirely on the heater type you use. For example, infrared heaters heat instantly, while oil heaters need a few minutes to warm up. However, that isn’t really important at all. Especially if you’re looking for a heat source for sleeping, speed doesn’t matter.\nElectric blankets also need time to warm up.\nAll in all, space heaters and blankets heat within a few minutes. Nothing to complain about.\n4. Efficiency Space Heater Con: Space heaters need lots of energy. Usually, they run on 1500W, which would cost you $0.18 per hour to run.\nElectric Blanket Pro: Electric blankets usually only need 150W to run. That’s just a tenth of what space heaters use.\nQuick Explanation Space heaters run on 1500W fixed unless you get a model with a built-in thermostat. A thermostat will dynamically change the power output depending on which room temperature you desire. In this case, space heaters are an efficient heating source.\nThe difference is that space heaters heat a whole room, whereas a blanket heats just one person. Obviously, an electric blanket is more efficient.\n5. Price Space Heater Pro: You can find space heaters at every price point.\nElectric Blanket Con: Electric blankets are less flexible in price. Usually, they cost around $50.\nQuick Explanation If you’re on a budget, I’d definitely pick an electric blanket. They usually cost around $50, but their long-term electricity costs are lower than that of space heaters.\nIn case you prefer a space heater for cheap, check out Best Space Heaters Under $50: A Complete Guide to the Cheapest Ones.\nGenerally, space heaters can get more expensive than blankets. Yes, you’ll find some under $50, but for really good models you should spend $100 or more. There are even some Dyson heaters which cost up to $600!\n6. Safety Space Heater Pro: Has plenty of safety features built-in.\nCon: Misuse can still lead to safety issues.\nElectric Blanket Pro: Generally safe, because it draws very little energy.\nCon: No safety features, or only a built-in shut-off timer.\nQuick Explanation Everybody knows space heaters for their safety issues. However, most of the accidents happened because of misuse. As long as you have a basic awareness of safety, you can’t do anything wrong with a space heater. I suggest to google search “space heater safety tips” and read through the first result.\nTo compensate for its bad reputation, space heater manufacturers started building heaters with plenty of safety features! From tip-over protection to automatic shut off timers, overheat protection and safety certifications. Space heaters are safe nowadays.\nElectric blankets, on the other hand, are generally safe because they consume less energy. But they come with nearly no safety features. Mostly, all you get is a built-in shut off timer.\nOn top of that, there are concerns about harmful effects caused by the electromagnetic field of electric blankets. However, there’s no study that proves it.\nSpace heaters win this point.\n7. Portability Space Heater Pro: Compared to other heat sources like a furnace, or a radiator, extremely portable.\nElectric Blanket Pro: Very portable as well.\nQuick Explanation The portability point, of course, has to go to the electric blanket. They are blankets. It’s difficult to build a heat source that’s less portable than that. You can also put your blanket in a suitcase and travel with it. Maybe they’ll let you take it on an airplane.\nI’m sure nobody would allow space heaters on an airplane.\nSpace heaters still do a great job. Their goal is to replace regular heat sources, so that’s what they’re actually competing with. Compared to furnaces or radiators, they are extremely portable.\nStill, electric blankets win this point.\n8. Heating Capacity Space Heater Pro: Can heat a big room with many people in it.\nElectric Blanket Con: Heats just one person.\nQuick Explanation Here’s a fundamental difference. While a space heater heats a whole room, an electric blanket can heat just one person. Also, space heaters make up a great emergency heat source.\nIf you want to keep warm together with your family, a space heater is definitely the better choice. If you rather heat just yourself, while reading a book, for example, an electric blanket is better.\nIt’s a draw and depends on what you want. Do you want to heat just yourself? Or do you want to keep everyone warm?\n9. Versatility Space Heater Pro: Very versatile. You can heat your home, a garage, a basement, a party tent … you get it.\nElectric Blanket Con: Not very versatile. To use it you need to tuck yourself up.\nQuick Explanation With an electric blanket, you are very much limited to lying on your couch, your bed, or sitting at your desk. But cooking or repairing the car becomes impossible with a heated blanket.\nStill, you can get creative with electric blankets. For example, you can use them to heat the weight bench in a cold garage gym ( see this article).\nGenerally, though, electric blankets are inferior to space heaters. They limit your ability to move and are less versatile.\nIn contrast, you can carry a space heater anywhere you want and you can keep warm in every room. And it doesn’t matter whether you just lie down on the couch or whether you workout. A space heater will heat you without disrupting your activity.\n10. Maintenance Space Heater Pro: Needs no maintenance. If it breaks after a few years, just get a new one.\nElectric Blanket Pro: Needs no maintenance either. But when something breaks, it’s easy to fix for an electrician.\nQuick Explanation Both space heaters and electric blankets are maintenance-free. Which already makes them better than regular heating systems that you have to vent or refill.\nStill, space heaters or electric blankets can break (Our electric blankets electronics blew last week). And when they break, the best thing to do is just replace them.\n11. Stains and Greasiness Space Heater Pro: You can wipe stains off. The material is easy to clean.\nElectric Blanket Con: Hard to clean, but washable.\nQuick Explanation Space heaters look good for much longer. Their material doesn’t age, because it’s plain plastic, wood or light metal.\nOn the other hand, electric blankets get greasy very fast. Because they are warmer than regular blankets, they absorb oils faster. Electric blankets wear down faster.\nYou can wash electric blankets, but make sure to check the label for detailed info.\n12. Comfort Space Heater Pro: The right space heater always produces pleasant heat.\nCon: Some people say that space heaters dry the air (I was never able to confirm this).\nElectric Blanket Pro: Provides heat and is cuddly at the same time!\nCon: The air around you will stay cold.\nQuick Explanation When it comes to comfort, both space heaters and electric blankets are great to use! The way they increase your comfort at home is just a different one.\nSpace heaters mostly produce warm air, which heats your room. Overall, you’ll have a warm and cozy room.\nElectric blankets, on the other hand, are great for cuddling. You can wrap it around you and feel warm even when the room you’re in is freezing cold.\nAn electric blanket is also useful for preheating a bed. Trust me, it’s awesome!\n13. Storage Space Heater Pro: A space heater fits in any regular storage room. Maybe even in a closet to hide it.\nElectric Blanket Pro: Electric blankets fit anywhere. Storage is no issue with them. You can even travel with them.\nQuick Explanation Space heaters fit about anywhere. They’re not that big in size. Honestly, when I first got mine, I thought it would be a lot bigger. There are a lot of space heaters that you can store in a storage room or in a closet.\nElectric blankets are even better. Storage is absolutely no problem with an electric blanket. You can even take them with you for traveling. Whereas taking a space heater with you would require a lot more effort.\nFor RVs or camping, both are easy to store.\n14. Ease of use Space Heater Pro: Easy user interface. Set a temperature or power level and start heating.\nElectric Blanket Pro: Easy to use.\nCon: Awkward remote control that is connected to the blanket using a thick cord that is uncomfortable to handle.\nQuick Explanation Both space heaters and electric blankets are easy to use. However, space heaters are my favorite. You have a simple user interface where you can set shut-off time and temperature. Or just a simple power knob.\nWhereas with an electric blanket, you oftentimes get an awkward remote control that’s attached to the blanket using an old-fashioned spiral cord. The remote is impractical to use and often looks weird.\nThe worst thing is when you are cuddled up in the blanket and you want to change the heat. And then you notice that the remote is on the other side of the blanket, lying at your feet.\nElectric blankets are harder to use compared to space heaters.\n15. Overnight Use / Sleep Space Heater Pro: Oil heaters are very safe to use overnight. They come with a thermostat and auto shut-off.\nCon: Other heater types shouldn’t run throughout the night.\nElectric Blanket Pro: You can safely use an electric blanket at night. It also has an automatic shut-off timer.\nQuick Explanation For sleeping, space heaters are the better choice, because of several reasons.\nThe first one is that you don’t take a heat source with you in bed. That would be a safety hazard. The second one is that space heaters are very safe to run throughout the night and come with various safety features like automatic shut-off, overheat protection and a thermostat. And the last reason why space heaters are better for sleeping is that they heat the air. Warm air is much more pleasant to sleep with than direct contact with a heat source. To be fair, I have to mention that some electric blankets have an automatic shut-off function as well.\nFor sleeping, I’d stick to space heaters.\n16. Noise Space Heater Pro: Depends on the space heater model you pick. Oil heaters are very silent.\nCon: There are space heaters that are noisy (usually heaters with a built-in fan).\nElectric Blanket Pro: Absolutely silent.\nQuick Explanation Except for oil heaters, nearly all types of space heaters produce some kind of noise. The sounds either come from a humming transformer, or from a running fan. Space heaters handle a lot more power than electric blankets. And whenever you handle high powers, things will vibrate, hum and buzz.\nLightning causes thunder.\nSo, when you want to do something silently, I’d suggest picking an electric blanket.\n17. Children \u0026amp; Pets Space Heater Con: Not all space heaters are safe to use with children or pets. Oftentimes they have a hot to touch surface part.\nElectric Blanket Pro: Electric blankets are safe to use with children and pets.\nQuick Explanation When you have children or pets at home, you have to spend special attention to safety. Space heaters are oftentimes very safe, especially oil heaters. But other types of heaters, like infrared or propane heaters, usually get hot to touch. Even when there’s a protective grid that covers the heat source.\nElectric blankets are much safer for children and pets because they don’t produce that much heat.\nSo, nobody can burn his fingers or paws.\n18. Outdoor Use Space Heater Pro: Infrared heaters are a good choice for outdoor heating. Propane heaters are great as well. You don’t need any electricity to run them.\nElectric Blanket Pro: An electric blanket is even more efficient than a space heater for outdoor usage.\nCon: You need access to electricity.\nQuick Explanation For keeping warm outdoors, both space heaters and electric blankets are a good idea.\nWhenever you need to move around a lot, electric blankets get a little hindering. So, in that case, I’d suggest space heaters.\nOutdoors, infrared heaters or propane heaters are a solid choice. The best thing about propane heaters is that you can even take them with you on a camping trip. You don’t need access to electricity!\n19. Thermostat Space Heater Pro: Oftentimes have a built-in thermostat to efficiently control the temperature.\nElectric Blanket Con: Electric blankets don’t have a thermostat, just different power levels you can choose between.\nQuick Explanation A thermostat is useful for energy-efficient heating. Also, it prevents overheating, because it senses the current temperature and reacts upon it. A thermostat will automatically cool the heat source down when it gets too hot. And similarly, it will reheat, when the temperature decreases.\nSpace heaters oftentimes come with a built-in thermostat. Electric blankets don’t.\n20. Stability Space Heater Pro: A space heater, especially a quality product, is very stable.\nElectric Blanket Pro: An electric blanket is soft, so you can assume it’s stable as well. But wires can break.\nQuick Explanation Can these things break? Space heaters are made of solid materials that can withstand strains. An electric blanket, on the other hand, contains very thin wires that can easily break. Electric blankets are less “stable” than space heaters.\n21. Durability Space Heater Pro: The right space heater will last you for years. If not even a lifetime.\nCon: There are some cheap models that break quickly.\nElectric Blanket Con: Electric blankets are not durable. Oftentimes they have cheap electronics built-in which decreases their longevity.\nQuick Explanation Durability is my favorite point when it comes to the advantages of space heaters. A space heater can last you a lifetime. It will provide you heat for years to come.\nElectric blankets are not very durable. Oftentimes they have very cheap electronics built-in (I know that because I repaired one myself). They just don’t last.\nAn electric blanket may last you a few years, but you can’t compare it to what a space heater can do. Some heaters last for decades.\nConclusion: Space Heater vs Electric Blanket Space Heater vs Electric Blanket? Here’s the answer:\nA space heater is the better choice for heating a whole room while you’re doing something actively, whereas an electric blanket is better, for activities that don’t involve any movement. Space heaters are more versatile, however, they use more energy. Do you prefer cuddling or heating?\nAsk yourself this question and you will know which one’s the better choice for you.\nI prefer space heaters because you get more value for your money. You can use them anywhere. You can use it to keep your guests warm, for quick heating of a garage or to boost your temperature a little. Whereas an electric blanket is more of a one-purpose product.\nTake a look at the recommended products page to see my personal favorite space heaters!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/space-heater-vs-electric-blanket-21-pros-and-cons/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSpace heater vs electric blanket.

And how energy-efficient are Dyson heaters when compared to regular space heaters?\nDyson heaters are up to 30% more energy efficient than regular space heaters. At least that’s what Dyson claims. Today, I’m going to check whether Dyson heaters are as energy-efficient as they promise to be and whether getting one is worth your money.\nI’m an electrical engineer and together with you, I want to cut through the jungle of myths and claims. In this article, you’ll learn everything about how efficient Dyson heaters really are and whether Dyson is overselling their product, or whether it’s worth buying (I surprised myself with my findings).\nWe will have a look at the power consumption and the running cost of Dyson Hot + Cool heater fans. And after that, we\u0026rsquo;ll reality-check Dyson\u0026rsquo;s marketing claims.\nThis is going to be a totally neutral review. But soon, you’ll see that even with neutral words, some of the claims look ridiculous when you look at them from another perspective.\nHere’s the short answer: Yes, Dyson heaters are energy-efficient. Dyson Hot and Cool running cost is about 21 cents per hour. A Dyson heater does its best at optimizing electricity consumption. However, they are not any more efficient than any other regular space heater. Especially compared to oil heaters, Dyson heaters have no advantage at all.\nFirst, these are the Dyson heater fans we are talking about: Dyson Hot and Cool (click here to view it on amazon).\nLet’s take a look at the electricity consumption of the Dyson Hot + Cool.\nPower Consumption of a Dyson Heater The Dyson Hot + Cool is rated at 2kW (or 2000W), which is unusually high. Normally, most space heaters run on 1500W, which is a safer rating. I guess that it draws 2000W in order to be able to heat quicker. By using more power, it can, of course, blast more hot air in a shorter time. Which possibly makes the Dyson heater faster.\nBut that’s just one option. You could also say that the Dyson Hot + Cool heats using 1500W and powers the fan using the additional watts.\nWe can’t really know, because we don’t have access to internal data.\nBut at first, we can see, that a Dyson heater runs on 33% higher power levels than a regular space heater. This implies that it also uses 33% more energy.\nSo, how does Dyson claim to use 30% less energy than regular space heaters? The truth is that the Dyson Hot + Cool has a built-in thermostat that controls the temperature settings. Using this thermostat it doesn’t always run on full heat. We’ll cover the thermostat in more detail later on.\nSo far we can say:\nOn maximum heat settings, a Dyson heater uses 33% more electricity than a regular space heater. That makes it very expensive to run in uninsulated rooms, where it continuously runs on full heat to compensate for the heat loss.\nBecause of that, Dyson heaters are not good for heating garages, attics, workshops, etc.\nBut where do these efficiency claims come from? The next sections cover these topics.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the Dyson Hot and Cool running cost? Quick answer: The Dyson Hot and Cool running cost is about 21 cents per hour. This would add up to $25 per month (running 4 hours a day).\nI assumed an average electricity cost of 14 cents per Kilowatt-hour (kWh) and an average power consumption of 1500W.\nDyson heaters can consume up to 2000W peak. It will draw that much power when you heat or cool on the highest settings. Running a Dyson Hot and Cool on maximum settings costs about 28 cents per hour.\nOn the other hand, running a Dyson Hot and Cool fan heater on low settings will consume about 1000W, which is about 14 cents per hour.\nEnergy-Efficiency Benefits of Dyson Heaters Dyson advertises many different aspects of their heaters. Let’s take a look at some of them and tell, whether they play into the efficiency’s hands or not.\nAir Multiplier Technology At first, Dyson heaters have a built-in fan. It’s just concealed as “Air Multiplier Technology”. Using this technology, Dyson heaters are 75% quieter than previous models. Of course, they still make noise, because blowing air is never silent.\nHere’s something another reviewer said:\n“While we don’t have experience with the previous model, the Hot + Cool was far from unnoticeable when in higher speed settings.”\ndoityourself.com\nDyson heaters are not as quiet as they advertise to be. But there’s a cool info video about the air multiplier technology. I liked it a lot.\n\u0026amp;ab_channel=Dyson\nAs you can see in the video, Dyson’s favorite aspect of the air multiplier technology is that it has no blades. So, you can’t cut your fingers and it’s absolutely pet safe.\nStill, the airstream has to be produced somewhere, so what Dyson did is that they just changed the design of regular fan blades and turned them into more of a jet engine look-alike.\nLet’s still call it fan. In fact, it is a fan, it just looks different. This fan is hidden in the bottom part of the plastic body, together with the motor that powers it.\nAnd yes, I have to admit that Dyson does not expose any blades, but which fan in the 21st century (except for ceiling fans) exposes its blades? They are always encased in some kind of protective grid.\nDyson is just selling a regular fan with a different layout. Many reviews even suggest that it is in no way better than a regular ventilator.\nEnergy-efficiency of Dyson’s Air Multiplier Technology So, let’s finally take a look at the energy-efficiency aspect of Dyson’s air multiplier technology.\nTo produce a stream of air, you need energy. It doesn’t matter how exactly you create the airstream. And there’s nothing that is convincing me that the air multiplier technology is better than any regular fan.\nHere’s why:\nAccording to Bernoulli’s equation, the velocity of a gas increases when it moves through a thinner and thinner pipe. That\u0026rsquo;s also called the Venturi effect. This is what Dyson’s air multiplier technology does. The air stream is created with a bulky fan and as it reaches the top, it gets pushed out through a thin slit with high velocity.\nThat’s basic physics and doesn’t save you any energy. The air multiplier doesn’t help with efficiency. It just changes the pressure and velocity of the air. While the pressure decreases, the velocity increases. Which leaves you with a total of zero.\nIntelligent Thermostat The Dyson Hot + Cool comes with an “intelligent” thermostat. As an electrical engineer, I just have to find out what they mean.\nHere’s what they say:\n“AM09\u0026rsquo;s intelligent thermostat constantly monitors the room temperature – automatically switching on warm airflow to achieve your target temperature, and off when it\u0026rsquo;s reached.”\nDyson advertisement page\nNow, where is the intelligence?\nThat’s the BASIC functionality of every thermostat. There’s no intelligence involved. Just a controller that uses the environmental temperature and the set temperature to find the optimum power settings.\nEven though when Dyson sells its heaters, it makes them sound like they are disruptive technologies. But it’s far from that. Every control engineering student learns how to build such a control system in his first semester.\nYou can find equivalent “intelligent” controls in so many other devices around you: In your oven, in a phone charger and especially in other space heaters.\nWhat Dyson sells as intelligent is nowhere near intelligent. There are dozens of other space heaters you can buy that make use of the same technology but cost just a sixth of the price.\nYou can view these space heaters on my Recommended Products page (click here to view it).\nHow every thermostat works Thermostats are actually very simple (if you ignore the math behind them). The thermostat senses the current temperature in your room and compares it to the set temperature you want to reach.\nBased on the difference, it calculates the optimum heat output in order to reach the desired heat without overheating.\nWhen the set temperature is reached, the temperature difference (set temperature minus measured room temperature) is zero, which causes the heater to stop heating.\nAre Dyson Hot and Cool thermostats more efficient? I didn’t find any reliable source stating that Dyson heater thermostats are more efficient than others. The only information I found is that once the set temperature is reached, the thermostat decreases the power to around 1000W.\nThis makes sure the heater runs with reduced energy usage.\nOf course, thermostats are GREAT for saving energy. And I truly believe that the thermostat that Dyson uses is a good one that works just right. I also believe that the engineers did a good job at balancing the control parameters to maximize efficiency while still retaining heating speed.\nStill, that does not separate Dyson heaters from other, regular space heaters. A thermostat is a good selling point. But you can also get solid thermostat technology with space heaters that cost less than $150. The thermostat doesn’t explain the price of over $500.\nSafety The surface of a Dyson Hot and Cool heater doesn’t really heat up. It’s perfectly safe to touch and therefore a perfectly safe product for families with children.\nAlso, in my opinion, a surface that doesn’t heat up is a sign of quality. It tells you that the manufacturer has control over the heat distribution on the surface.\nBut also a cool surface means that Dyson heaters don’t waste any energy for heating the surface. Some other space heaters get so hot, that their plastic surface melts.\nI can’t imagine that this will ever happen with a Dyson Hot and Cool.\nSo that’s definitely a good sign. The energy you put in the heater is what goes out of it. No energy is wasted on the side.\nHow long does it take to see savings? With everything we now know about Dyson heaters, it gets pretty easy to estimate how long it takes to see the savings. I want to answer the question “For how many months or years will you need to use your Dyson heater so its savings make up for the $500 price tag?”.\nLet’s assume that 30% savings compared to regular space heaters is true (which I don’t really believe). How long will it take to earn (or save) your money back?\nTo start, we first need to know how much electricity a regular space heater uses. I have already written an article about that and here’s what I found:\n“Average 1500W space heaters will cost around $40 per month to run 8 hours a day.”\nheatertips.com - Space Heater Cost guide\nAssuming that you use your heater only in the winter months (the cold 6 months from October to March), that would leave you with $240 per year of electricity costs for a regular heater.\nHow much would a Dyson heater use? If we believe the claims of 30% savings, a Dyson heater costs you $28 per month, which is $168 per year. In total, that would be $72 of savings per year.\nNow, most Dyson heaters cost around $500.\nThis means that it takes you 7 YEARS to earn your expenses back. And who knows whether your heater will even last for that long?\nA Dyson heater is not worth it in terms of savings if you use it for less than 7 years.\nHow to Maximize Dyson Heater Efficiency There’s one concept I love to share on this website and you’ll find it over and over again if you browse through other articles here.\nIt’s something that nearly everyone misses while talking about the efficiency of heaters.\nHere’s everything in one sentence:\n“ Each space heater has characteristics that outperform any other heater if you use it correctly.”\nme\nWith “using it correctly” I mean “using it in the right places.\nFor example:\nAn infrared heater is able to heat outdoors by heating objects it radiates at. Infrared radiation can’t be carried away with the wind. This is exactly, where an infrared heater outperforms any other heater type. Its special characteristic is that it uses radiation. That’s why it is the best type of heater for heating outdoor locations or uninsulated rooms.\n1. Use your Dyson Heater in the right spot The special characteristic of a Dyson heater is that it distributes the heat using a strong airstream.\nWhere is this special characteristic useful? You can immediately see, that a Dyson heater is totally inefficient for outdoor heating. Because it heats by blowing hot air, all you do is heating the environment.\nWith their air multiplier technology, Dyson Heaters are an excellent choice for heating large rooms indoors. Because of the forced air, the heat reaches every corner of the room.\nThat’s where it outperforms any other heater.\nUsually, the best heaters for heating rooms are oil-filled heaters. They are very safe and efficient. However, Dyson heaters are even better than the oil heaters, because their airstream can carry the air wherever you want.\nAnd on top of that, the head of a Dyson heater rotates. Meaning that it automatically and evenly heats the whole room. It doesn’t leave any cold spot.\nIf you have a living room to heat, that’s where I would suggest using a Dyson Hot and Cool heater. For smaller rooms, smaller, regular heaters are fine as well.\n2. Set the thermostat Dyson has developed solid thermostat technology that is able to save 30% compared to other heaters.\nYou might already think, that’s awesome, but you can do even better. What if you could save another 4%, 8% or 10%?\nIt’s actually pretty easy. According to studies, lowering the temperature of a thermostat by just a single degree will save you 4% in heating costs.\nLowering it by 2 degrees will save you about 8%.\nJust by lowering the setpoint of your thermostat you can easily save $20-$40 each month. And it’s really easy to do it. I mean, all you have to do to compensate for the lowered temperature is to wear warmer clothes.\nYou can, for example, just put on a hoodie in the evening. Wearing warm clothes will reduce the need for heating and thus also save you money.\nYou can use the money you saved to buy even more hoodies (just joking).\nEven with an efficient thermostat, there’s always room for improvement. So, lower it and decrease your electricity costs each month.\n3. Set the right direction of the airstream The last step to maximize the heating efficiency of your Dyson heater, another thing you should do is to set the right airstream direction.\nThe benefit of Dyson heaters (as we already covered) is that they can use the stream of air to carry the heat through your room. If you, however, misplace your Dyson heater, the airstream will face a wall and not live to its full potential.\nI suggest to always place the heater in such a way that its airstream goes from one corner of your room to the opposite corner (diagonal).\nDiagonal heating means that the resistance of air decreases. Also, make sure that your heater doesn’t face any obstacles. You don’t want to heat up a closet. You want to heat your room.\nOptimizing the direction of the airstream causes higher efficiency. Definitely remember this point when you set up your heater.\nComparison: Dyson Hot and Cool vs Regular Oil Heater To make this whole guide complete, there’s one section that I just HAVE to include. This chapter is very important to understand that not all advertisement claims are as good as you think at first. You’ll see why in just a minute.\nHere’s what Dyson advertises:\n“No fast-spinning blades, no visible heating elements. Automatically shuts off when tipped over.”\nOfficial Dyson page\nLet’s investigate whether these 3 points separate a Dyson heater from a regular oil heater.\nNo fast-spinning blades Dyson heater: Has no fast-spinning blades. Regular oil heater: Has no fast-spinning blades either. When you research Dyson heaters, this is one of the most common advertisement statements they use. And it’s absolutely true. Dyson heaters have no fast-spinning blades.\nBy the way: With fast-spinning blades, Dyson is talking about simple fans to increase the heat transfer. But fast-spinning blades sounds a lot more dangerous. So, that’s the reason they choose to use this phrase.\nThe truth is: Dyson heaters hide their “fast-spinning blades” inside their bodies.\nNow guess what: Regular oil heaters don’t have any fast-spinning blades. Not even ones they hide inside their body. That implies, that at this point, a regular oil heater is even better than a Dyson product.\nAnd the very same is true for infrared heaters or gas heaters, which have no moving parts as well. in fact, many heaters don’t have fast-spinning blades.\nThe only type of heater that usually has a built-in fan is a ceramic heater, which produces heat using a ceramic heating element. The hot air is then blown out by the fan. But ceramic heaters also encase their fans in some kind of protective grid, so it’s impossible to touch them and hurt yourself.\nDyson heaters have absolutely no advantage in this point.\nNo visible heating elements Dyson heater: Has no visible heating elements. Regular oil heater: Has no visible heating elements either. Dyson heaters hide their heating element within their bodies.\nThe heating element of an oil heater is encased in the metal body as well. Now, oil heaters have an even bigger advantage at this point:\nThe heating element of an oil heater is permanently sealed in a metal body. It’s absolutely impossible to touch it unless you have a tank to destroy the heater.\nStill, having no visible heating elements can be an advantage, especially if you have safety concerns. Heating elements are dangerous when you have kids or pets at home. That’s why a Dyson heater is definitely a better choice than an infrared heater for example.\nI have an infrared heater at home and even though there’s a protective grid covering the heating elements, the grid heats up and gets dangerously hot. You can definitely burn your fingers.\nDyson heaters and oil heaters don’t have exposed heating elements, which makes them a very safe choice.\nAutomatically shuts off when tipped over Dyson heater: Comes with automatic tip-over protection. Regular oil heater: Comes with automatic tip-over protection as well. The automatic tip-over shut-off protection is something that nearly every space heater these days has. It’s nothing special at all.\nBut that’s positive: Tip-over protection makes space heaters much safer. Dyson has a big impact on the heating industry. If they didn’t include tip-over protection, possibly other brands would copy them and cause a decrease in safety standards.\nWell done. Automatic tip-over protection is a must-have.\nConclusion - Are Dyson Heaters Energy-Efficient? Dyson heaters are not really better in terms of efficiency than other heaters. At least not in terms of functionality. Still, they have everything you wish for in a space heater. A good and reliable thermostat, safety features and a very safe design.\nWhat I like about Dyson heaters, is that they just look so much better than regular heaters. You shouldn’t view them as just a heater (or a fan). Dyson heaters are designer products. Having one will make a visual impact on the appearance of your home and definitely make a change.\nOne guy on a forum said this:\n“Come on guys. It\u0026rsquo;s not just hot air, it\u0026rsquo;s Dyson hot air…”\nmacman on moneysavingexpert.com\nIn terms of efficiency, Dyson heaters are definitely worth considering. Especially if you look for a heater to use long-term.\nEven though this review was very critical at first, I became a fan of the Dyson Hot and Cool. It’s a new concept, a new design, and finally something that revives the heater industry.\nI hope that other companies follow along and make their heaters look as good as Dyson heaters. That futuristic style really grabbed my attention.\nAttributions: images by TAKA@P.P.R.S (license: CC BY 2.0)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-dyson-heaters-energy-efficient-a-critical-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s the average Dyson Hot and Cool heater fan running cost?

(Running Cost of Hot + Cool)"},{"content":"This guide is all about the electricity usage of oil heaters. You are probably about to get a new space heater and wondering whether getting an oil heater is the right choice for you. Oftentimes, you have several concerns when you’re about to get a brand new heater.\nHow much electricity do oil heaters use? Is it expensive to run an oil heater continuously? Are oil heaters more efficient than other types of space heaters? How can you reduce the electricity usage of your oil heater? In this article, we’re going to tackle all these questions (and even more)! And don’t worry. You don’t need to be an electrician to be able to follow along. I’ve made this guide as easy and beginner-friendly as possible. All you have to do is to read through it and cherry-pick the information you need.\nIn my experience, oil heaters are among the best types of heaters you can buy. You just need to know the right information before you get one, so you can use it in an energy-efficient way. After reading this article, you’ll know EVERYTHING about the electricity usage of oil-filled radiators.\nSo let’s start turning you into an expert.\nHow much electricity do oil heaters use? Here’s the short version: Oil heaters generally use 1500W of power. But the exact amount depends on how you use your space heater. You can influence the electricity usage of an oil heater a lot by simply tweaking the temperature settings and using it in the right spots.\nMost space heaters, not just oil heaters, run on 1500W. But with oil heaters, you are still able to impact the electricity usage to be lower than that. We’ll cover how later on.\nAs always, there are also some exceptions. So-called mini oil heaters use just 700W of power. They are designed to heat rather small rooms or just to keep your feet under your desk warm. So, let’s just assume that the space heater you want to get uses 1500W.\nTo have a better understanding of how much 1500W actually is, here are a few examples:\nRunning a 1500W oil heater is the equivalent of powering 3 desktop gaming computers or two vacuum cleaners at the same time.\nUnderstandably, and I totally agree with you, this sounds like a lot. But don’t worry, later on, we’ll cover the costs and you’ll see, that it’s not as bad as you think.\nDo other space heaters use less electricity? If oil heaters use 1500W of power, and that’s the equivalent of two vacuum cleaners at the same time, maybe a thought pops up in your head questioning whether you should get another type of heater.\nSadly, that’s not an option. Nearly all other space heaters use 1500W as well. You can go online and check the wattage of different heaters and you’ll quickly know that it’s true.\nIf you already have a space heater at home, you can find the wattage rating on the packaging or in an online manual.\nNearly all space heaters use 1500W because that’s the maximum power you should pull from a wall plug. And manufacturers want to produce heaters that can heat as effectively as possible. So they max out the power usage. On top of that, heat is the most “expensive” form of energy. It takes a lot more power to heat a room than to illuminate a room.\nAnyways: Oil heaters stand out from the crowd.\nIn contrast to many other heater types, they oftentimes come with a very reliable and precise thermostat.\nOil heaters are much better at picking the right temperature settings and controlling the temperature in a room, whereas other types of heaters easily produce more heat than you actually need.\nThat’s why oftentimes you’ll find a decrease in cost when you switch over to using oil heaters. Later on, we will cover how and where to use oil heaters to save money.\nThe electricity usage of an oil heater depends heavily on where you use it. So keep reading.\nHow much does an oil heater cost to run? Okay, so we’ve already covered the basics of oil heater electricity usage and why oil heaters are sometimes the better choice compared to infrared, ceramic or gas heaters.\nSo, let’s find out how much an oil heater actually costs to run.\nBy assuming that your space heater runs on 1500W, we cover nearly every oil heater out there. Still, there are some exceptions like 700W oil heaters or heaters, where you can customize the power settings.\nNow, the average electricity rate in the US is at about $0.12 per kWh, which means that running a 1000W (or 1kW) device for one hour will cost you $0.12.\nI’ve already done all the work for you. Here’s a complete table of different space heater wattages and electricity rates, so you can look up how much your oil heater will cost you to run per hour.\nWattage / Rate$0.08$0.10$0.12$0.14$0.16$0.18$0.20500W$0.04$0.05$0.06$0.07$0.08$0.09$0.10700W$0.056$0.07$0.84$0.98$0.112$0.126$0.14\n900W$0.072$0.09$0.108$0.126$0.144$0.162$0.181100W$0.880$0.1100$0.132$0.154$0.1760$0.198$0.221300W$0.104$0.13$0.156$0.182$0.208$0.234$0.261500W$0.12$0.15$0.18$0.21$0.24$0.27$0.30\nIf you are the more visual type of person and you prefer seeing images rather than a table, here’s a 3D chart that I have created for you. It contains exactly the same data as the table above and you can use it to look up your oil heater cost per hour.\nAs you can see, depending on your electricity rate and your power settings, your space heater can cost anywhere from $0.04 to $0.3 per hour. And I didn’t even include the whole range of possible costs.\nFor example, in European countries (and very few US states), electricity rates up to $0.30 per kWh are possible as well.\nTo find out how much your heater costs to run, you need to know both parameters: Your electricity rate and the power consumption of your heater. Finding the wattage of your space heater is easy. Either you already know it, or you can quickly look it up online or in the manual.\nTo find out your electricity rate, the best way is, of course, to dig up your last electricity bill and check the rate they charged you.\nBut if you’re not sure where to look, or if finding your most recent electricity bill would be a mess, then you can go an easier route. You can take a look at my article about space heater electricity costs (click here to view it). It contains an infographic, which shows you all the US states together with the average electricity rates there.\nThen, simply look up the state you live in and once you found it come back to this article. Just use the table above to look up your hourly space heater costs then.\nIs an oil heater expensive to run? Wait, we just covered exactly how much an oil heater costs you. Why is there another section about whether using an oil heater is expensive to run? Well, it’s because knowing the cost of your space heater is just one side of the coin. Let’s take a look at the other (better) side.\nThe question about whether using space heaters is expensive usually comes up right before you’re buying a new model. The answer is: It depends. Obviously, you can run an oil heater on different power levels and in different parts of your home with different insulation levels. All of these factors impact whether your heater is going to be expensive or not.\nGenerally, using a 1500W oil heater is not more expensive than using your regular central heating radiator. To be very precise, an average oil heater that you run for 8 hours every day, will cost you about $43 of electricity cost per month.\nOf course, this appears expensive at first. You could also pay your gym or your Netflix subscription using this amount of money. But the reality looks different. Here’s what most people overlook:\nFirst, no oil heater will power through 8 hours continuously on full heat. An oil heater, for example, uses its thermostat to control the temperature and to use the right power level to efficiently reach the temperature you set. It only has to heat up once and then use less power to retain the heat. Only when you open the windows, the power usage goes back to full heat.\nBut that’s also true for other heaters. No one will blast an infrared heater for 8 hours and nobody will fire up a propane heater for 8 hours on full power.\nThis means, that most likely, it will cost you less than the monthly $43 I just mentioned to heat your home.\nAs you see, the expenses of your oil heater can’t really be calculated beforehand without knowing your usage and how the space heater reacts to certain conditions.\nLater on, I will show you how you can use your oil heater to minimize the expenses significantly.\nAnd still, that’s not the whole story. There’s another reason oil heaters are not as expensive as you think.\nHow an oil heater affects your utility bills Many people feel anxious when they get their first space heater, power it throughout the winter and then check their electricity bill.\nHow much is it? For some people, it can definitely go above $200 or even $350. Especially if you heat your whole home using just space heaters. Of course, that sounds shocking at first. But here’s why the rising costs shouldn’t bother you.\nThe reason many people think that space heaters are a waste of energy is that they look at the increase in their electricity bill and panic. However, nearly everybody misses the point that the heat you produce using your space heater doesn’t need to be produced by your central heating system any more.\nMeaning that what you previously paid for heating bills decreases, while your electricity bill increases. You are just shifting the costs.\nUsing a space heater causes the shift of your expenses from your heating bill to your electricity bill. But in total, not much changes. The only thing that’s different now is that instead of using fuel to produce the heat, you use electricity. It’s as simple as that.\nTotal Utility Bill Expenses So, do space heaters increase or decrease your total costs? This depends heavily on the state you live in. Running a space heater instead of a fuel-powered central heating system is most likely still more expensive because electricity rates are higher than fuel rates.\nStill, your total costs don’t rise as much as you previously expected them to. And now you know why. You just shift the expenses from one bill to another. What you pay more on electricity, is what you save on the heating bill.\nI believe, that in the future, the generation of electricity might become even cheaper, especially compared to oil prices. That’s why electric heaters are the future - but we’ll see. I don’t have a magic glass ball.\nOil-Filled Radiator Efficiency Here’s the part of the article that contains the most important insights you can possibly get about space heaters. In this section, you’ll learn to understand key aspects of heating efficiency and saving money long term. Stay tuned.\nThe efficiency of your oil heater depends heavily on 4 different things. After reading it, you’ll know exactly how to choose and use the right oil heater.\nChoosing brands The first question that might pop up is: Is there any significant difference between running a brand oil heater and other (non-brand) models? Do brand models use less energy? Are they better at saving electricity?\nThe quick answer is: No, brand products are in no aspect better in saving electricity than other heaters. Even though many people believe they get a better, more efficient oil heater when they pick a brand product, that’s not the case in reality.\nOftentimes, DeLonghi heaters are way more popular than other, smaller brands, like Pelonis. Even though you pay up to 50% for a very similar model with exactly the same features.\nOn my “recommended products” site, I wrote a definite guide on the (in my opinion and in my experience) best oil heater (by far) - and guess what. It’s NOT a brand product.\nIf you want to know which oil heater is the best value for your money (and I’m 100% sure with this one), here’s the full article on My all-time favorite Oil Heater! (click to view the article).\nWhether you pick a brand model, like a DeLonghi oil heater, does not a difference regarding energy consumption at all. It doesn’t even make a difference in safety and functionality. Picking a heater that is popular and well-tested by the public (I mean a model with as many reliable reviews as possible) is the right way to go.\nBrands have absolutely no impact on the efficiency of an oil heater.\nWhere to use oil heaters Here’s something that definitely has an impact on your space heater efficiency: The location you try to heat.\nAnd again, that’s something only few guides cover. Luckily, you’re reading this right now and you should know that you’re in the right place.\nHere’s the important part:\nEach space heater has its own application in which it outperforms all the other types of heaters. For example, an infrared heater is better than any other heater at heating outdoor locations, such as uninsulated garages or party tents. The reason is that infrared heaters use radiant heat, which is a kind of heat that can’t be blown away by the wind.\nThe nature of the technology of an infrared heater defines where it is better than other heaters. The same is true for oil heaters and every other heater type.\nAn oil heater, for example, is not useful outdoors at all. It would be a total waste of energy. Because oil heaters attempt to heat the air, the heat they produce is quickly carried away with the wind. So, oil heaters are the worst heater choice when you want to heat an outdoor location.\nBut what are oil heaters good at?\nOil heaters are better than any other type of heater in heating a large, closed room continuously for long periods of time. Because oil heaters heat the air, the heat will feel much more natural - not like radiant heat.\nOil heaters can run for very long times continuously (because they don’t get dangerously hot). This makes them the best type of heater for heating overnight. The thermostat of oil heaters is also way more reliable than that of other heater types.\nAlso, oil heaters are the safest type of heater: They don’t get hot to the touch and come with plenty of safety features. Which makes them the best heater choice for indoor heating with kids and pets.\nThere’s no heater that is as good in replacing a regular central heating radiator than an oil-filled electric heater. They do the exact same job. The only difference is that they are powered by electricity instead of fuel.\nThermostat Efficiency Oil heaters have one more tremendous advantage over other heater types: Their thermostats work way better.\nTo understand why here’s a simple explanation. A thermostat always needs two inputs. The first one being the current measured room temperature and the second being the current set temperature (the temperature you set using the thermostat interface, most likely a display).\nUsing these two parameters, the thermostat can always decide how to control power usage to heat efficiently.\nHere’s an example:\nWhen the measured room temperature is lower than the set temperature, the heater knows that it has to increase the power.\nWhat separates oil heaters from other heaters is that they can much more precisely measure the current temperature. Either they measure the oil temperature directly, or they measure the temperature of your room.\nIn contrast, infrared heaters would have more difficulties. They don’t heat the air, because they heat using radiation, so they can’t really know what the current temperature is.\nThat’s why oil heater thermostats are better. They can more accurately measure and predict the best ways to control the heat.\nMore efficient thermostats will also mean less power usage and thus higher energy savings.\nDifference between oil heaters and other electric heaters There are quite some differences between oil heaters and other space heaters. Here are some of them.\nIndirect heat: Oil heaters heat in two stages: Meaning they first heat the oil, and then the oil heats the air of your room. At first, that sounds like you waste energy. But that’s not the case. All the heat eventually reaches your room, just at a slower pace. Weight: Also, oil heaters are much heavier than other heaters, because they consist of a heavy metal body that carries the oil. Which in turn makes oil heaters less portable, but more durable. No moving parts: Oil heaters don’t have any moving parts, like fans or motors, which is why they don’t wear off at all. There are no parts that cause friction and rub against each other. Also, there’s no single spot where a lot of heat accumulates. Meaning that no parts will ever melt. Silence: Because there are no moving parts, oil heaters are absolutely silent. There’s no humming or buzzing as with infrared heaters and no blowing fan as with most ceramic heaters. Thermostat: Also, because they nearly always have better thermostats, oil heaters don’t turn on and off over and over again. They’re able to control the temperature in a smooth way. Safety: On top of all these advantages, oil heaters are also safer, because there’s no overly hot spot. The heat distributes over the whole metal body, which makes them absolutely safe to touch, even when they run on full heat. How to reduce the electricity consumption of your oil heater Here are 5 tips on how you can decrease the electricity consumption of your oil heater.\n1. Use it in the right spots As we already discussed, using an oil heater outdoors makes absolutely no sense. The heat gets carried away quickly.\nSimilarly, oil heaters are not the best choice for uninsulated rooms. Any insulation issue will also carry away the warm air. Use oil heaters only in closed, insulated rooms.\nThat’s where you can benefit most from them. That’s where oil heaters can play with their advantages.\nInfrared heaters are great for the most part of your home. You can use one in your living room, your kitchen or your bedroom. Just avoid using it in an uninsulated garage, a workshop, your basement or your attic. These places often lack insulation and make heating with an oil heater inefficient.\n2. Set the thermostat “For every degree, the thermostat is raised, 4% to 8% can be saved.” Department of Natural Resources Lousiana - Adjust your thermostat\nWhile the department in the quote above was talking about cooling costs (like for air conditioning), the very same is true for space heaters as well.\nA simple decrease in the set thermostat temperature by just one single degree will lead to a 4% save of heating cost.\nSo, set the temperature according to your needs and don’t be wasteful. When you set your temperature too high, your oil heater will run on full power for much longer, because it needs to compensate for higher cool-down rates of your room. More heat means more reheating, which will raise your energy bill. That’s why energy costs don’t rise linearly (doubled temperature leads to double cost), but quadratically or exponentially (doubled temperature leads to quadrupled cost).\n3. Don’t run on full power If you have an oil heater without a thermostat, but with different power level settings, don’t pick the highest setting.\nThe highest power level (1500W) is only necessary in sub-zero temperatures and you can easily save money by avoiding it. You don’t even give up comfort.\n4. Improve insulation “EPA estimates that homeowners can save an average of 15% on heating and cooling costs (or an average of 11% on total energy costs) by air sealing their homes” energystar.gov\nInsulation is one of the most important aspects when it comes to heating. And the best thing about it is, that you insulate only once, but you benefit from it for a lifetime.\nInsulation will only cost you once, but because of it, your lifetime utility expenses will drop by 11%.\nHow awesome is that?\n5. Wear warm clothes By wearing warm clothes, you effectively minimize the amount of heating you need. And as you have seen in the first tip, reducing the temperature can save you significant amounts of money.\nAnd it’s extremely easy to do. I mean, you already have the clothes in your closet. So, why don’t you put on a new layer of clothes (e.g. a hoodie) and decrease the temperature?\nIt will save you money. By the way, here’s a big article on the 21 cheapest ways to heat.\nAre oil-filled heaters cheaper to run than other space heaters? Here’s the conclusion. From everything we covered in this article, we can tell that yes, oil heaters are cheaper to run than other space heaters.\nBut it depends on several aspects.\nIf you use your oil heater in insulated closed rooms, oil heaters are the very best choice.\nOn other occasions, another heater type might be the better choice. You can check out different heaters at the recommended products page (click here to view it). You’ll find the most important heater types together with in-depth reviews and the best ways to use them to heat as cheaply as possible.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/electricity-usage-of-oil-filled-heaters-the-ultimate-guide/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis guide is all about the electricity usage of oil heaters.

This is often an issue when you rely on a wood stove. While one floor is perfectly heated, the upstairs floor remains ice-cold.\nHere’s the short version: To get heat upstairs, you have to improve ventilation and insulation in your home. If you feel like your home still doesn’t feel warm upstairs, you should add other heat sources. For example, you can use space heaters. They will make a significant difference. However, that’s just half of the story. Keep reading to learn more.\nI want this to be an in-depth guide that covers as many possible aspects of getting heat upstairs as possible. So, many points will be detailed. I hope, it will help you and be a full resource for you!\nWhy there’s no heat upstairs I’m totally with you. Currently, your upstairs floor doesn’t heat at all. There’s no real heat source. Instead, you use a heat source that’s located on the bottom floor. Because the house is so old, I’m sure your ancestors or the previous owners figured that as long as you heat the wood stove on the first floor, the heat rises and will heat the upper floor as well.\nHowever, that is NOT the case. But why?\nHot air rises - but somehow not upstairs Hot air rises. That’s something everybody knows. And if there’s anyone who doesn’t know anything about physics, he still knows that hot air rises.\nIt’s just human everyday experience. A candle flame doesn’t heat sideways, but upward.\nEven if that’s the case, for some reason heat stays only on the bottom floor in your case. I totally know how bothered you are.\nAnd there are several reasons why your home doesn’t seem to heat. In this article, we’ll take a look at all of them.\nHere’s why your upstairs floor doesn’t heat:\nEnergy Loss: First, heat loses energy while it rises. It’s similar to a candle flame. Hold your hand right above it and you’ll burn your fingers. But a few feet above, it is perfectly safe. This also has to do with the distribution of heat, but you get the point.\nAnd it’s very similar in your home. Even if you heat one floor, the heat will lose energy while it’s rising. On the way up, it cools down. Lack of Ventilation: When the air in your house doesn’t move enough, heat exchange is pretty much impossible. There’s a reason that moving air is used for heat-exchange (for example with hairdryers or a central heating system), but stagnant air is used as an insulator (in winter jackets, where the wool traps air and insulates you from the cold).\nWithout an effective heat exchange in the form of moving air, getting heat upstairs is really difficult. Improper Insulation: Especially in old houses or cabins, there’s no real insulation. Because of the missing insulation, warm air leaks and cold air comes in. You don’t really notice it downstairs, because your heat source is there. But upstairs, cold air comes in. Especially through thin, one-pane windows or uninsulated walls.\nImproper insulation is one of the most important reasons for a cold upstairs floor. If your home was perfectly insulated, the heat would have no other option, but rising upstairs. Where this can happen Obviously, a lack of upstairs heat nearly always happens in old houses, especially when there’s no real heat source upstairs. Oftentimes, these types of houses have a wood stove on the first floor and pipes going upwards. These pipes carry some of the heat from the stove.\nHowever, on cold nights, the pipes don’t really help a lot. They definitely keep temperature up a few degrees. But surely not on a comfortable level. Rather on an arctic survival level.\nSimilarly, the no-heat-upstairs issue occurs on other buildings where there’s no common heating technology used. For example in cabins, where you just have the bare minimum comfort. While it’s cozy and warm on the first floor, the upstairs floor remains cold and you have to sleep in a frosty bed.\nSome old students dorms have the same issue. Oftentimes they don’t have their own heat source, but only a few pipes that run through each room. These pipes conduct the heat that is produced by the central heating unit. Oftentimes these central heating units run on an ECO power-mode and save energy leaving the students freezing in their dorms.\nHow to get Heat Upstairs This section covers all about how to get heat upstairs. My suggestion is to read each of the topics and then decide what you want to implement in your home. Some of them are easy and affordable, while other methods cost more effort.\n1. Distribute the heat using fans The easiest thing you can do immediately is to place a fan downstairs to blow heat upstairs. I believe the best way to do it is to have the fan at the bottom of the stairs with the air stream blowing upward on full power. This way you push the warm air up.\nHowever, some people might argue you should rather blow the cold air from the upstairs floor downstairs so the cold air can heat up and rise again. It seems like for some people doing it that way works better.\nThat’s why I suggest simply trying both fan orientations and then deciding it for yourself. Possibly, the layout of your home has an impact on which way works best.\nFrom a scientist’s perspective, it doesn’t make a difference whether you do it this way or that way. So, it’s up to you to find out.\nKeep in mind that you still need to have a practical placement of the fan. For example, don’t make the fan an obstacle by placing it right in a doorframe where someone can fall over it. This becomes an issue with kids or pets at home, especially at night, when it’s dark.\nFor the best ventilation (and heat transfer) possible, it is best if you leave all doors open which connect the downstairs floor with the upstairs floor. The hot air should be able to freely move between stories.\nEven Better: Use two fans If you have two fans at hand, it’s even more effective. Place the first fan right next to your heat source and face it toward the stairs. Then, place the second one at the stairs facing upward. This way you create a stream of hot air that moves to the upstairs floor.\nTwo fans are much more effective than using just one. So, make use of them if you have two at home.\nHowever, using fans all the time is not really a sustainable solution to your upstairs heat problem. It may help to keep the temperature up, but it creates noise and consumes additional energy which you could also use for powering a heater instead.\n2. Upgrade Stove or Fireplace When your heat source is an open fireplace, you waste a LOT of heat. The efficiency of fireplaces is only about 12%. Meaning that you are getting just an eighth of the heat you would theoretically be able to get.\nThe reason is that fireplaces are the most inefficient way you can possibly heat. Most of your heat is going up the chimney. So, it’s lost forever. You burn lots of wood, but you don’t really get much out of it, except for the cozy crackling of the fire.\nTo upgrade your heating, add a wood stove insert. With an insert, the heat accumulates in your room instead of going up the chimney directly.\n“Fireplace inserts have a sealed, airtight door system which generates more heat because the fire burns much slower and the heat isn’t wasted. The efficiency of fireplace inserts can be as much as 80%”\nchimneyspecialistsinc.com\nSo, a wood stove insert takes the efficiency of your wood stove from 12% to 80%. You effectively sevenfold the heat you’re getting.\nAnd with more heat downstairs, it becomes easier to get more heat upstairs.\n3. Use a heat powered Stove Fan A heat powered stove fan is a fan that you place on top of your stove to distribute the heat. But the difference to regular fans is that you don’t need to power it directly. A special metal construction powers the fan with the rising heat.\nStove fans help distribute the heat in your room. Especially for small homes, they make a difference. However, if you’re living in a bigger home, stove fans might be too weak.\n4. Insulation Insulation is another key part to heat your house efficiently. Also, it makes a HUGE impact on whether the heat disappears on the way up, or whether it goes up and actually heats your upstairs floor.\nWe’ll cover insulation in an extra section later on, so keep reading.\n5. Add a heating unit upstairs Instead of trying to get the heat to move up, why don’t you install a new heat source upstairs? By doing so, the heat you produce on the bottom floor is independent of the upstairs floor.\nAlso, you don’t attempt to heat a whole house with one heating unit, which is a waste of energy.\nBut which heat source is best to use? And which one can you install without too much effort? In the following sections, we’ll cover everything you need to know, so you can decide which heater suits you best.\nCentral heating vs Space Heaters When you want to add a heating unit, you have two basic options: Either you choose to connect the upstairs floor to your central heating system somehow, or to use a portable space heater.\nWhich one you pick, depends on your personal preferences. Here are the most important pros and cons of each type of heater.\nPros of Central Heating Reliability: Central heating is a reliable and long-lasting way to heat. Usually, a central heating will last you a lifetime. Especially, if you already have a proper central heating system in your home, connecting it to the upstairs floor would solve your problem immediately. Long-term solution: Radiators that distribute the heat of a central heating system last for a very long time. Centralized heat: Because the heat is produced in a centralized way, you always know where to look, when something goes wrong. Cons of Central Heating High cost: If you don’t have central heating yet, adding it will cost a lot. But even if you want to extend an existing central heating system, to be able to heat the upstairs floor, you’ll need to have a few thousand dollars at hand. Maintenance: Central heating needs maintenance regularly because almost always is there something that goes wrong. But not only that, but you’ll also need to order fuel deliveries and pay high bills for them. Fuel consumption: Central heating needs to heat an entire water tank to distribute the heat in each room. Because of that, it’s not the most efficient way to heat. Especially when you’re not using all rooms regularly. Pros of Space Heaters Low cost: Everyone can afford to buy a space heater. Compared to extending a central heating system, space heater costs are neglectable. Quick heat: Space heaters produce heat immediately. Especially infrared heaters. I have one and it reaches full heat within just a few seconds. Strong: When you use the right model, you have a strong heat source that is equally effective as a radiator. No maintenance: Space heaters don’t need maintenance at all. Cons of Space Heaters Safety: Space heaters are generally very safe to run. However, you can’t run them in your absence. At least you shouldn’t. Because there have been various accidents in the past. But as long as you have a basic awareness of safety, you don’t have to worry at all. Nearly all accidents happened because of misuse. Electricity: Space heaters draw a lot of electricity. So, you shouldn’t power too many devices together with your space heater at the same time. A fuse could blow. Generally, I recommend space heaters over adding or extending your central heating system. They are much more affordable for everyone and have basically the same heating power as central heating.\nI’ve been into the space heater topics for several months now. And during all that research I found the most reliable, durable and most affordable space heater models for you. If you are curious, here are the best space heater models you can find: Recommended Products (click to see my favorite heaters).\nSpace Heaters: Electric vs Propane for Heating Upstairs When it comes to space heaters, there are two types you can use for heating upstairs. Either you choose to use regular electric heaters or propane heaters. Both are very reliable and indoor friendly.\nYou can also find them on my recommended products page.\nHere’s when to use which kind of heater:\nElectric heater: I recommend to use an electric heater when you have access to electricity. If you want to know more about the monthly cost to run such an electric heater, here’s a lookup infographic of average electricity cost and how to calculate your personal space heater costs. Electric space heaters are also the better choice if you are a rather lazy person (like me) who doesn’t want to go and buy new propane all the time. Propane heater: Propane heaters are unbeatable if you want to heat, but you have no access to electricity. Also, you don’t face all the issues that electric heaters can cause. There’s no power cord that can catch flames and no transformer making noise. Add Insulation to your Home If you still don’t get any heat upstairs, I’m 100% sure that insulation is the reason your upstairs floor is cold.\nInsulation can make a tremendous impact on how efficiently your home heating works. It makes all the difference. All heat that would normally go up vanishes somewhere, most likely because it escapes through thin, uninsulated walls that allow heat exchange with the cold outdoor air.\nYou can insulate many different spots in your home. From floors to walls and the attic. But what should you insulate first?\nInsulate your attic If your attic is not insulated, you effectively have a big heat sink. Because heat rises, an uninsulated attic is nearly the same as having no roof above your head. Sure, your roof protects you from rain and snow. But it does not really keep the cold away.\nLuckily, insulating your attic is way easier than it sounds.\nIf you have no idea, where to start, I recommend to go to YouTube and search for “how to insulate an attic” and you will find dozens of helpful videos. From experts who show you their best tips to laymen who show you how they did it.\nMostly, insulating an attic involves installing some kind of glass fiber insulation or styrofoam insulation. And it’s not expensive at all. You can insulate your attic with just a few tools and an insulation kit you can find online.\nJust look for an attic insulation kit and you will find exactly what you need.\nWhen you’re not a passionate craftsman, you may worry about doing something wrong. But actually, there are no traps to fall into as long as you stick to the tutorials and the manual. I suggest to take a weekend off and make insulating your attic a weekend project.\nReplace single-pane windows Old houses and cabins oftentimes have single-pane windows, which lose a lot of heat. Because they are so thin and consist of just one layer of glass, they don’t help much with retaining the heat indoors.\nDouble-pane windows are a must-get if you don’t have them yet. Not only are they significantly thicker and more durable, but the thin layer of air in between the glass panes adds another layer of insulation.\nIt’s very similar to wearing layered clothing, which is usually more effective than wearing a single thick layer.\nWhat to do if you still feel cold Let’s assume that you’ve done EVERYTHING we covered in this tutorial. For some reason, it seems that your upstairs floor still doesn’t get any heat.\nWhat can you do to keep warm upstairs?\nGenerally, I recommend getting a mattress pad together with an electric blanket for sleeping. An electric blanket is just like a regular blanket, but it is able to heat up. This way, you have a heat source that helps to keep you warm. Also, electric blankets use just a tenth of the power a space heater requires to run. So, they’re incredibly efficient to use.\nThe mattress pad will help to cover your body while you sleep and limit the cold airflow. And on top of that, as a side effect, it will protect your mattress from wearing off.\nI suggest getting an extra fluffy mattress pad that will keep you warm even more. You’ll be thankful for having the mattress pad and the electric blanket for cold nights.\nConclusion To summarize everything, here’s a small hit list of what you need to do to get more heat upstairs.\nInsulate the attic: Insulation will prevent the heat from cooling down on the way up. Add fans to distribute the heat: When fans push the heat upward, the heat distributes much quicker. Moving air is a heat conductor, while stagnant air is an insulator. Space Heaters: Use a space heater to add a new heat source upstairs. Using fans all the time is not a sustainable way to heat. Space heaters will add a lot of comfort to living on the upstairs floor. Electric Blankets: An electric blanket is the last resort. If all the other methods don’t work for you, use an electric blanket. It will keep you warm and doesn’t even require much power to run.

Usually, when you try to get a cheap torpedo heater, you are disappointed by what you receive. Therefore, I recommend getting a known and popular product right away.\nNo matter what you use it for, whether it is for construction work, for keeping your garage warm, for a workshop… the right heater will support you at your work. A bad heater will only hinder you and produce unnecessary problems.\nShort version: I recommend getting the Mr. Heater MH60QFAV (click here to view it on amazon) right away. It’s a reliable and solid heater and you really get what you pay for. The heater is definitely able to keep up with your heating needs and won’t disappoint you. When you get the right heater right away (instead of buying low-quality torpedos), you will save money. The Mr. Heater torpedo may even become a lifetime-buddy you don’t want to miss anymore.\nMy philosophy with buying new heaters is (as you might have already noticed), to get the most out of your money and to avoid problems. You get the most value from your money by relying on popular, well-tested heaters. At the same time, you avoid unnecessary problems by getting a heater that works well right away!\nSo let’s take a closer look at why getting the Mr. Heater MH60QFAV should be your first choice.\nWhy I Chose the Mr. Heater MH60QFAV Heating Power “I purchased this propane heater to heat my uninsulated 750 sq ft garage. [\u0026hellip;] It worked flawlessly and heated my workspace to a comfortable 60 degrees in about 45 min, on high. The outside temperature was 29 degrees.”\na reviewer\nThe Mr Heater forced-air torpedo heater outperforms every other heater I know of at that price range. A heater that overcomes the heat loss of an uninsulated garage can heat ANY room. Especially when it’s a closed room.\nTorpedo heaters are naturally the most powerful heaters because they have access to lots of energy (stored in the propane gas) that they can withdraw without limits. In contrast, electric heaters are usually limited to 1500W, because that’s what the electric grid can handle.\nAdditionally, these types of heaters force the hot air out - similar to a jet engine. That’s why they look is so similar. It guarantees high convection (movement of the air) and thus a short heat-up time.\nEase of Use The Mr. Heater torpedo heater is incredibly easy to use. As a power source, you just need to hook a 20lb propane tank up and you are ready to go.\nWith a control knob, you can regulate the gas flow to the burner and thus the temperature and heat output you get. It’s as easy as that. That’s all there is to propane heaters.\nThat’s also why torpedo heaters are considered manly (and unsafe). There are no fancy extras, no built-in timers or unnecessary sensors. This is a powerful heater at the bare minimum.\nYou get high heat and simple usage.\nQuality Of course, the heater produces sound. That’s totally normal because high pressurized gas is burned and then forced out at high speeds. But in comparison to other torpedo heaters, this one is significantly quieter.\nThe materials of the heater together with its control knob and the gas connectors make a decent impression and feel high-quality. I have nothing to complain about.\nDurability There are two things to talk about regarding durability: The first one is how long a regular 20lb propane tank lasts with the heater. And the second one is about how long the heater itself will last you.\nThe first question is easy to answer: On the highest settings, a 20lb propane tank will last you for 12 hours. Of course, you can easily double the longevity of a tank if you decrease the heat settings.\nBut how long will the heater itself last? Let me tell you: For a very long time.\nBecause except for the fan that forces out the hot air, there are absolutely no moving parts in the heater. Meaning, that it is very unlikely to wear off.\nDepending on how much you use the Mr. Heater torpedo heater, it can easily last you years, if not decades.\nSafety Tips for using the Mr. Heater MH60QFAV When it comes to safety, torpedo heaters are the riskiest heaters. The reason is not that propane is unsafe in general, but that it outputs tons of heat.\nYou absolutely should install a carbon monoxide monitor wherever you use it. The heater is generally safe to use. However, you should just make sure to avoid an accident.\nBecause of how physics works, burning oxygen always increases carbon monoxide concentration in a room. In garages, this is less likely to happen because they are usually better ventilated. But definitely go the safe route and prepare.\nBetter safe than sorry.\nAlso, don’t place the heater next to any inflammable objects. The heat that comes out at the front is really dangerous. Some torpedo heaters even output open flames.\nConclusion Among all torpedo heaters, the Mr. Heater torpedo is by far my favorite. It is reliable, high-quality and is a perfect heat source for working in uninsulated rooms, such as garages, workshops or construction sites.\nIf you want to check whether there are other types of heaters that suit your purpose, check out our other recommended products.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/recommended-products/torpedo-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to buying a torpedo heater, you should get a suitable model right away.

If you want to save money, you should be picking the one that lasts forever. Not only will it save you the stress to look for new propane heaters over and over, but you also feel much better, knowing you have a model that will reliably heat - even in emergencies.\nQuick answer: I recommend the Mr. Heater Propane Heater (click to see it on amazon). It can heat an average-sized living room for up to 108h continuously on a 20-lb propane tank. On maximum settings, it still lasts for 24h and produces the equivalent amount of heat of 3 electric space heaters running on full power.\nI’m not trying to convince you to spend your money on a heater that you think is too expensive. Instead, I’m trying to SAVE you money. You could either pick the right model right away or buy multiple new heaters over the years. Getting the Mr. Heater propane heater is picking the right model right away.\nWhy the Mr. Heater Propane Heater is the Best Heater (Facts \u0026amp; Figures) If you’re not sure yet, here’s the part where I tell you exactly what I like about the Mr. Heater propane heater and why I think it’s the best propane heater for you.\nI’m assuming that you need a reliable heater to heat either your home, a cabin, a garage, or similar. For all of these cases, the Mr. Heater propane heater does the job perfectly well.\nFor this price range (about $150), its quality, safety, and trustworthiness in emergencies are above expectations!\nHeat production and durability The Mr. Heater propane heater produces up to 18,000 BTUs of heat per hour. That\u0026rsquo;s the equivalent of 3 strong 1,500W running on maximum power settings.\nThere are 3 different heat settings you can use.\nSetting (BTUs / h)Heating duration on a 20-lb propane tank (in hours)4,0001089,0004818,00024\nEven the lowest heat setting of 4,000 BTUs per hour produces the equivalent amount of heat as a 1,100W space heater. That\u0026rsquo;s enough to keep an average 150 - 250 square feet living room at a comfortable temperature of around 65°F in wintertime.\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s not enough for you, the 9,000 BTUs or 18,000 BTUs setting will serve you well.\nA full 20-lb propane tank refill costs you only around $15 depending on the propane gas rate in your area.\nQuality When you first get the heater, you notice that it’s a very solid model. There are no unnecessary parts and nothing that can break off easily. A good sign.\nThe knob is responsive and feels of high quality, which I personally like very much. The handle to carry the space heater around is solid. You can’t collapse it. I guess the reason is that collapsable handles are more likely to break, so the engineers chose to design the heater in a robust way.\nAlso, the heater has rubber legs, so it can’t slide around. They also protect wood floors from scratches. What rubber legs also tell you aside from that, is that the heater doesn’t get hot on the bottom. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have picked the rubber material. Which is a very good safety aspect.\nAlso, the material is very lightweight and easy to carry around. That’s extremely helpful when you are outdoors, heating a cabin or fishing.\nSome Mr. Heater models also have a built-in fan that you can power with batteries or with a power adapter that you have to buy separately for a few bucks. However, I think the fan is more a gimmick than actual functionality.\nIt helps to distribute some heat, but don’t expect it to force out lots of hot air.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why the Big Buddy model I recommend comes without a built-in fan.\nIf you choose a Mr. Heater model with a fan, it runs noiselessly- another sign of good quality.\nFunctionality You can hook the heater up to propane tanks. From 1lb bottles to 25lb bulk propane tanks. To connect it to the bigger tanks, you need to get a separate hose, which you can easily find on amazon. Otherwise, it’s limited to two 1lb bottles.\nThe heater can switch between low and high heat settings. So, you can always decide whether you need lots of heat or you rather want to save some energy. Oftentimes, the low setting is warm enough.\nThe propane bottles are VERY easy to hook up - it takes less than 5 seconds if you know how to do it. It’s a screwing mechanism, which makes it safe and simple.\nOn each side of the heater, you can hook up one 1lb propane bottle. You can choose to run 1 or 2 bottles at the same time, but for the high-heat setting, you need to have two bottles hooked up.\nWhat I love: The heater puts out a LOT of heat on the high setting.\nYou can easily heat a 200 sq feet cabin from 35F up to 65 or 70F with it. Also, you can reliably heat a tent with it. It can keep any garage warm. And you can take it with you for fishing.\nThere are countless applications where you will bring the heater! And trust me: Your buddies will want to borrow it.\nReliability In terms of reliability, the Mr. Heater propane heater is unbeatable! You can use it as a primary heat source in an off-grid cabin for weeks.\nSomeone claimed that they heated their cabins for 5 weeks continuously with the Mr. Heater.\nThis heater beats everything else and I’d trust it fully in emergencies. I KNOW that it will deliver heat when I need it.\nHere are some other points why I think this heater is great.\nIt is indoor safe. You can run it for weeks without failure. It is efficient and burns all the propane without leaking. 20lb of propane last up to a week in snowy weather Safety and the Mr. Heater Propane Heater Regarding safety, here’s an important note: Because of the quick change in gas pressure when you heat it on high, the propane bottles can freeze. That’s not the heater\u0026rsquo;s fault, but simple physics and it’s not dangerous at all. Just saying this so you don’t worry when you try yours.\nThis happens only with the 1lb bottles, but not with 20lb tanks or higher.\nMr. Heater keeps up with common safety standards. For example, it comes with very sensitive tip-over protection that instantly shuts the heater off once it tips a little.\nIn contrast to other (cheaper) heaters, here’s something that is different: The Mr. Heater does not smell at all. No gas leaks. This is a sign of high safety standards and will even save you gas in the long run.\nThe gas connections feel very solid and well-manufactured. Not cheap at all.\nHow hot does the Mr. Heater get? The Mr. Heater Big Buddy propane heater can heat large living rooms and off-grid cabins to very hot 86°F in the wintertime, given you run it on full settings. On low or moderate settings, you can expect to heat up to 77°F.\nDepending on where you use your propane heater, it heats your space at different times. At home, you are well able to stay warm on low settings.\nHowever, in an outdoor cabin, it takes forever to heat on low. Because you need to compensate for the cold outdoors, you should crank the heater up and use the high mode. Then, it’s able to heat a regular-sized cabin within 10-15 minutes.\nIt could be that you think the heater is TOO hot. However, that’s way better than delivering too little heat. Simply shut it off when you feel your space is toasty. You can always turn it back on when you need to reheat.\nWhen you are outdoors or in a tent, where there are no walls to keep the heat, the heater works similarly to an infrared heater. The warmth feels like you’re sitting at a campfire. While the one side of your body that faces the heater stays warm, the other side stays cool. Sadly, that’s physics. So, the heater does the best it can.\nThere are no heaters that can fully heat you when you sit outdoors.\n“Without the Big Buddy, I would not endure the cold very well in my cabins. This product has allowed me to work anywhere, in any weather, for the minimal price of a tank of propane.”\ntkh - reviewer\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/recommended-products/propane-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Mr. Heater propane heater can produce heat equivalent to 3 average 1,500W space heaters and lasts up to 5 days on the lowest setting.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither you pick cheap ones that will last for a few months until they break or you pick a good one right away that will last a lifetime.

I am just convinced that this one is by far the best value-for-money deal you can currently get.\nNow hold on: I want you to pick the right oil heater right away. My buying philosophy is to look for items where you get your money’s worth. I want you to minimize the long term cost.\nCarless buying of heaters could lead to bad choices and buying the wrong products that don’t last long or don’t fulfill your needs. So, you would need to look out for heaters over and over again.\nInstead, the one I’m going to tell you about is my result after MONTHS of research. And after all this time writing about heaters, I’m absolutely sure, that this is the model you should get.\nHere’s the short version: I absolutely recommend getting the Pelonis Oil-Filled Radiator (click here to view it on amazon) . It has an outstanding price but doesn’t cut off any functionality or safety aspects compared to other heaters. The Pelonis heater comes with tons of useful features: From a remote control (so you can control the heater from the couch or bed), an automatic shut-off timer and a thermostat to safety certifications and manufacturer warranty.\nWhy I Chose the Pelonis Oil-Filled Radiator Functionality Functionality-wise, the Pelonis heater comes with absolutely everything you would ever need in a heater. I could list all the features here and tell you everything about them, but I’m going to keep it short.\nIt comes with:\nAutomatic shut-off timer: You can set the automatic shut-off timer to any time up to 10 hours. It is mainly meant for heating while you’re sleeping. You could, for example, set it to 4 hours and then go to bed. Overnight, when the 4 hours are over, the heater automatically shuts off to save energy. Thermostat: A thermostat is always useful because it makes sure that your room is heated to a certain temperature. The thermostat also prevents overheating, because it automatically decreases the power once the heater gets too hot. On top of that, you save energy, because a thermostat makes sure that your heater only draws power when it needs to. Power modes: You can decide between three power modes, high, low and ECO. While high drains 1500W, low uses 900W and ECO switches back and forth to optimize the power usage. This way you can lower your electric bill if you want to.\nGenerally, you can leave the heater on low unless the outside temperature drops below the freezing point. Wheels: So many oil heaters come without wheels which makes it really hard to carry them around. With wheels, it becomes way easier. No fan: Is no fan a functionality? To me, yes. Because fans always produce noise. And especially when you want to calm down or heat and night, you want a silent heat source. The Pelonis heater distributes the heat using the special surface design of the metal heating body instead of relying on a fan. Comparison to brand products But what is so special about all these functions? Other oil heaters have the very same functionality and work in very similar ways.\nYes, that’s right!\nHowever, you always need a fair comparison! When you look at other heaters with similar features, they are always priced well over $100, whereas the Pelonis heater is significantly cheaper.\nThe only difference, for example, compared to a DeLonghi heater, is that Pelonis is not a popular brand. But you get the most out of your money. A comparable DeLonghi Heater is the DeLonghi TRD40615E (click to view it on amazon). It has very similar specifications. However, you have to pay a significantly higher price.\nI’m not saying that DeLonghi is bad, it’s just more expensive and you don’t really get more value out of it.\nMy choice would be the Pelonis heater.\nQuality The quality of the heater is just about what you would expect for that price. It’s not very astonishing, there are plastic parts, but they don’t look like they’re cheaply made.\nQuite the reverse!\nThe Pelonis heater leaves a good impression and looks like a solid product. But always keep in mind, that you paid only a few bucks for it and you shouldn’t expect to get a luxury product.\nValue for Money Unbeatable! The value you get for your money is incredible! I already listed all the features of the heater above, but you still get so much more. I didn’t even get to list the safety aspects yet (see the section below).\nFor the price you pay, the Pelonis heater is by far the best heater you can get. It’s also the cheapest product on my Recommended Products page. All other heaters I recommend, whether they are infrared, propane or torpedo heaters are more expensive and have FEWER features than this oil heater!\nSafety \u0026amp; Certifications The Pelonis heater is ETL certified, which is a sign of quality and tells you that the heater fulfills all current safety standards.\nOf course, it comes with tip-over protection and overheat-protection. I guess, otherwise it wouldn’t even have passed the ETL certification tests.\nWhat I like a lot about all oil heaters is that they’re always safe to touch. No oil-heater gets burning hot because the actual heating element is encased in the metal body. So, there’s no way to burn your fingers.\nThat’s why the Pelonis heater is a good choice for families with children or pets. Especially, when you have birds flying around, oil heaters are the best choice. Dogs and cats usually keep a safe distance from too hot heaters.\nIf you have a cat, you will oftentimes find your cat snuggled up in front of the heater.\nAdvantages of an Oil Heater I’m already glad that you’re on this page, which tells me that you are looking for an oil-filled radiator. This is a great idea because oil heater come with a vast amount of advantages over other types of heaters.\nEven heating: Oil heaters have the advantage of heating the air evenly. Compared to an infrared heater, the heat just feels much more natural. Oil heaters produce warm air instead of radiation that can dry your skin. Heating capacity: Because of their big oil-filled metal body, oil-filled heaters have a high heating capacity, meaning they can produce lots of heat. But the oil-filled body also stores heat and keeps emitting warmth, even after turning the heater off. In contrast, infrared heaters get cold as soon as you turn them off. Efficiency: Because of their high heating-capacity and their ability to heat the air evenly, oil heaters are the most efficient type of heater when you want to heat big-sized rooms. Safety: Oil heaters are the safest type of heaters as well. The heat is distributed over the large metal surface, which means there are no single hot spots where you can burn your fingers. That’s perfect for families with children and pets. Conclusion Oil heaters are great all-purpose heaters. They are a solid choice for everyone looking for a safe and reliable way to heat their homes.\nWhen you are looking for one, I definitely recommend getting the Pelonis oil-filled radiator. It comes with all the features you wish for, but at a much lower price than comparable products.\nYou simply get the most value for your money with this one.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/recommended-products/oil-filled-radiator/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve been recommending one oil-filled radiator model over and over on this website.

I tried, tested and researched several infrared heaters and came to a conclusion.\nMy goal is to pick a model where you get the most out of your money. I don’t want you to waste time and energy on buying heaters that will last you only a few months or can’t deliver the heat you need.\nHere’s the short version: The best infrared heater in terms of quality, price, and reliability is by far the Dr Infrared Heater Dr-968 (click to view it on amazon) . Among all infrared heaters, it is my favorite, because, in contrast to other models, it is able to keep the temperature of big rooms high, even when it’s the only heat source in your home in mid-winter. The Dr Infrared Heater is incredibly good to have for emergencies and whenever you need a reliable heat source. It comes with all the safety features you need and has a built-in thermostat (which is unusual for infrared heaters).\nThe Dr Infrared Heater costs a little more than some other heaters, but it’s absolutely worth it. In the long run, paying the price once will save you so much more money.\nInstead of wasting money on useless infrared heaters that don’t really work until you randomly find a model that lasts, why not buy a durable one right away? With the Dr Infrared Heater, you get a heater that will last you for many many years (And that’s even guaranteed with a 3-year warranty).\nWhy I Chose the Dr Infrared DR-968 There was one story that totally convinced me about the Dr Infrared heater. It proves that you can rely on it.\nReliability This heater is battle-tested:\nIn a freezing cold winter night with sub-zero degrees, a father’s oil furnace ran out of heating oil. Overnight the house lost all the heat and in the early morning, the house was cooled down. When you are alone, that might be no problem. Just order new fuel and wait for the delivery (takes 1 or 2 days). But with a wife and two kids at home, you should guarantee that they stay warm.\nLuckily he bought two Dr Infrared Heaters before. Before his wife and his kids woke up, he set up the heaters and turned them on.\nTwo days later, when the fuel was delivered, his kids didn’t know anything about the heating outage. The father was able to heat his WHOLE 1200 square feet home with the two heaters for two days continuously. The temperature inside was toasty and you couldn’t tell that there was a heating outage.\nIn my opinion, it’s astonishing that two simple infrared heaters are able to heat a whole house in mid-winter. I would always choose the Dr Infrared Heater because I know that I can trust them to keep the temperature up.\nThe infrared heater has nearly 6,000 positive reviews on amazon and is, in my opinion, a totally convincing product.\nYou can go so wrong with infrared heaters: I once bought a heater that was not even able to heat a single (small) room, even though its energy usage implied that it should be able to.\nHere’s another review about the Dr Infrared Heater:\n“Ran this bad boy constantly 24/7 from like November to April because the place we were renting had no heaters that actually worked. [\u0026hellip;] Thanks to two of these heaters we heated about 800 square feet all winter long”\nProduct review\nFunctionality In contrast to many other infrared heaters, this one comes with a built-in thermostat. You can simply set your desired temperature and let the heater do the job.\nIt cycles on and off to maintain and control the heat you desire.\nAdditionally, it comes with a built-in timer, that automatically shuts the heater off after a set time. This eliminates the need for external timers. Also, you can use the heater safely overnight, because you know, it will shut off automatically.\nComfort This is a powerful heater. But the heat it produces is warm and toasty and feels good. It’s not the dry kind of heat that cheaper heaters produce.\nThe Dr Infrared Heater is quiet, but not super quiet. As a powerful heat, it source produces sounds. If you want to use it overnight, it’s better to place it in the hallway instead of in your bedroom. Then you can hardly hear it.\nQuality The quality is JUST right. You definitely get the most out of your money with this heater. The control interface on the front doesn’t seem like it’s cheaply made. The knobs feel good, which leaves a good impression.\nAlso, you get a 3 YEAR warranty, which tells you that the manufacturer trusts his own product and knows it’s good. Which is, in my opinion, a very good sign.\nSafety Only one small part of the heater gets hot: The metal grid that protects the heat source, where the heat comes out. So, that’s unavoidable. There are some people complaining about it, but it makes no sense. It’s like complaining that a frying pan gets hot. The heat must escape somewhere.\nThe other parts of the heater are all completely safe to touch and don’t get hot to the touch, which makes it very safe.\nIn contrast to other heaters, this one doesn’t turn on right away when you plug it in. This is another safety feature that ensures it doesn’t turn on accidentally, for example when it’s connected to a misconfigured timer.\nJust like other heaters, you get additional safety features like tip-over protection and overheat protection.\nConclusion The Dr Infrared Heater DR-968 is by far the best value for your money. For a reasonable price, you get lots of functionality, heating power and safety features for your home.\nIt is perfect for heating rooms without any heat sources, for emergencies (as in the heating-outage story above) or in garages or cabins.\nI’m always surprised by how much heat this heater can put out.

What’s the best way to heat your garage gym?\nWorking out in an ice-cold garage is not the healthiest thing to do, aside from the lack of motivation you have. That’s why you need to set your garage gym workout up properly to be able to heat it in the cold seasons.\nIn this article, you are going to learn 21 different ways to stay warm and heat your garage gym. From keeping yourself warm to proper insulation and buying the right heaters: You will learn everything you need to know.\nAfter reading it, you will have the knowledge you need to never have a cold garage gym workout again.\nHere are 21 ways how to heat your garage gym.\n1. Layer up clothes To stay warm in your garage gym, there’s one thing you can change immediately: Your clothing.\nThe best way to reduce the need for heating is to layer up clothes. The more layers you wear, the better.\n“Indeed, clothing plays the ultimate role in effectively protecting the human body by controlling the heat transfer from the body to the thermal environment or vice versa.”\nUNIST Multidisciplinary Institute, Ulsan, South Korea\nLayered clothes work much better in terms of insulation than a single layer of thick clothing.\nThe reason is that the main insulation is accomplished by trapping air. It’s not the cotton or wool that keeps you warm. It’s the air that is trapped between the wool strands.\nBy layering up clothing, you create more air pockets that act as efficient insulation.\nIf you wear the right clothes, you might not even need to heat your garage gym.\nYou can layer up clothes in several ways. I found 3 layers the best:\nBase Layer: The first layer is the so-called base layer. Its main job is to wick away moisture from your body - like a sponge. Insulation Layer: The second layer is the insulation layer. It limits the air exchange and creates air pockets between your body and the outer environment. The first layer can consist of synthetic sports fabrics, as in thermal long sleeve clothes or simple wool or cotton. Outer Layer: The third, outer layer protects you from the weather. It can withstand wind and rain. But because we’re talking about how to heat a garage gym, the outer layer can consist of a simple hoodie. If you don’t have special thermal wear, don’t worry. You can make up all the clothing layers of simple t-shirts and pullovers you already have at home. They will keep you warm enough in a garage gym.\n2. Wear shoes If you do your workout barefoot, just with socks, or with simple slippers, stop it! I know that in a garage gym, you feel like you’re at home. Well, you are. But still, you’re in a cold place.\nSo, don’t skip wearing proper sports shoes.\nShoes are the ultimate protection for your feet and you should not miss them.\nWith cold feet, you put additional stress on your immune system, which you do not want in a garage gym workout. You might even perform worse.\nShoes provide proper insulation that keeps the cold away. Mostly garage gyms have cold concrete floors, which makes shoes a must-wear in the wintertime.\nWhen it’s really cold, you don’t even need to wear sports shoes. You can do your workout with thick winter boots as well.\nFor workouts, where you need good mobility, you can also wear weightlifting shoes.\n3. Wear gloves When it’s cold in your garage gym, you need protection.\nYour body sees your gym as a collection of ice-cold barbells your hands don’t want to touch. But they have to.\nWhen you’re working out with ice-cold steel, you need something to protect your hands. Gloves add a layer of insulation to your hands and ensure that your skin doesn’t freeze (Yes that could happen).\nFingers are very sensitive to the cold, and during a workout, your hands are sweaty and moist. Which is why touching cold metal with them is dangerous. It’s similar to licking frozen metal in wintertime.\nImportant:\nWear gloves that cover your fingers completely instead of the popular half-gloves used in weightlifting.\nScientists from Loyola University wrote the following when they researched fingerless gloves:\n“Fingers are one of the first body parts to suffer from the cold and popular fingerless texting gloves can lead to frostbite”\nLoyola University Health System\n4. Insulate your garage door If your garage door is not insulated yet, this is something you HAVE to do. Absolutely every garage gym needs insulated doors.\n“If you tend to have mild winters, you can probably keep your garage at a comfortable temperature by simply insulating your garage door and windows, and weather stripping exterior doors.”\nbudgetdumpster.com\nNow don’t worry. You can do the insulation as a DIY project! It’s absolutely doable and doesn’t require many skills.\nThe level of insulation is measured using the so-called R-value. The higher the value is, the better the insulation. Depending on the climate in the area you live you should choose higher or lower R values.\nR-25, for example, insulates better than R-5.\nFor the insulation part, I recommend to do it as a weekend project (maybe you even get it done in an afternoon). To do so, you can get a simple garage insulation kit such as the US Energy Products NASA Tech Kit, which you can find online.\nThe best part about insulation is that it does not only retain the heat in the cold wintertime, but it also keeps your garage cool in summer! Insulation limits any kind of temperature exchange, so you have full control over your garage gym.\nIf you want to learn more, I wrote a guide on how to heat an uninsulated garage here.\n5. Warm up your barbell If you don’t have the option to preheat your garage gym with a heater, you likely start your workout in a freezing cold room. And working out with ice-cold barbells is not fun at all.\nTo compensate the cold a little, you can bring a blow dryer with you and preheat the barbell. Because it consists of steel, which is a very good heat conductor, the barbell will warm up evenly.\nThis way you protect your hands when working out. Touching warm metal makes the gym feel warmer overall.\nYou can see this tip as an alternative to wearing gloves. Both methods protect your hands. If you don’t have good gloves, warm your barbell.\nYou can also bring your barbell inside and store it somewhere. And whenever you work out, you bring the barbell with you. This guarantees that your barbell is at room temperature and you can comfortably start working out.\nInstead of using a blow dryer, you could also warm up your barbell using a space heater. Just place it in facing the workout area and your weights and barbells will warm up.\nKeep reading to find out which space heaters are suitable.\n6. Use an infrared heater For garage gym, the best electric space heaters are infrared heaters. The best thing about them is that you don’t need to preheat your garage gym at all.\nInfrared heaters emit radiation as soon as you turn them on. Within just a few seconds, they reach full heat. That’s why infrared heaters are efficient as well.\nOther types of heaters (like oil-filled radiators) need a few minutes to heat up.\nFor a garage gym, the best infrared heater you can buy is the Dr Infrared Heater (click to see it on amazon).\nCompared to other infrared heaters it is much more powerful and suited for heating rooms that require more heating power (like a garage).\nIt’s exactly what you need in a garage gym.\n7. Buy a torpedo heater Alternatively, instead of getting an infrared heater, you could also get a torpedo heater. Sounds manly? It is.\nA torpedo heater is the ultimate choice to produce lots of heat without the need for electricity. In fact, they produce so much heat, that they overcome any insulation issues. You can even heat rooms that are poorly insulated.\nTorpedo heaters work by producing a hot air stream (which is called “forced air”), similar to a jet engine. The downside to using them is that they are noisy.\nI recommend the Mr. Heater MH60QFAV (click here to see it on amazon) - which will keep any garage hot!\nAll you need is a propane tank. After hooking it up to the heater, it can run up to 14 hours on 20lb of propane.\nThat’s really durable considering that you don’t run the heater throughout the entire workout. It would probably get too hot otherwise.\nIf you run it for half an hour per workout, a simple 20lb tank will last for 28 hours of workout, which is 2-3 months.\nIn case you don\u0026rsquo;t want to pay so much money for space heaters, here\u0026rsquo;s a full post about the Best Space Heaters under $50.\n8. Put a towel on the bench You probably know the feeling of lying down on a cold bench. It’s horrifying and everyone hates it.\nThat’s why you should always put a layer of insulation between you and the weight bench. A towel is really useful for that.\nA towel prevents direct contact with your weight bench and thus keeps you warm. Also, it will reduce sweat stains on your workout gear. I know, it’s your own garage gym and you don’t care about your own sweat - but having everything hygienic as a side effect is still nice.\nI recommend to always have a towel prepared for use in your garage gym. Just put it on a shelve or clothes rack so you are always able to get it.\nThis way you don’t have to look for your towel before working out. You always have one in your gym.\n10. Warm up Literally warming up is important to stay warm in your garage gym. Never start a workout with full weights without warming up.\nWhen you enter your garage gym for a workout, the very first thing you should do before anything else is to do ave a small warm-up routine.\nEspecially because you’re coming from a cozy living room where your body could lower its efforts to keep your body temperature up.\nIn a cold garage gym, the environment is completely different and warming up becomes essential to stay healthy and to minimize the risk of injury.\nA quick warm-up routine would be the following.\nJumping jacks: Start your workout with jumping jacks to increase your heart rate. You will notice that your body gets warmer overall. Empty barbell warm-up: Before each new exercise, do one or two high-rep sets with empty barbells. These sets prepare your joints for heavier weights. Once you feel your body temperature warming up, feel free to start your working sets. The warm-up makes sure that you reach sufficient body activity before you strain yourself too much in the cold environment.\n11. Add a carpet Adding a carpet to your garage gym floor helps you in two ways:\nIt adds another helpful layer of insulation to your garage. And it makes your garage gym look better.\nCarpet creates tiny air pockets and decreases the amount of air that cools down on the floor. This way your garage can retain the heat for longer times once it heats up, which will, in turn, decrease your electric bill in the long run.\nTherefore, you actually save money!\nAlternatively, you could also use protective flooring mats such as rubber exercise mats. They have a similar insulation effect and protect your floor from damage as well.\nIf you don’t have any rubber mats in your gym yet, consider getting some. They definitely improve heat retention as well as the sound dampening in your garage.\nYou’re getting many advantages from adding a carpet or workout mats.\n12. Stop blaming the weather Even if your garage gym is freezing cold - so cold that you think you’re in Siberia - this article here is going to help you. You have already learned so much about heating your garage gym and there are more heating tips to go.\nI suggest ordering a space heater (infrared or torpedo I suggested above). It will arrive within a few days.\nBut until they arrive: Don’t blame the weather! Don’t take the cold as an excuse to skip your workout. Instead, have one last workout in the cold. It will increase your anticipation for the heaters.\nWorking out in a warm garage gym is much better than in a cold one, I admit it. But rock this one last workout in the cold.\nAfter that, you can plan which ways you will use to upgrade your gym.\n13. Shower A warm shower protects your body and aids your immune system. You should generally always shower after a workout. It has many positive health effects, aside from feeling just so much better.\nBut showering before your workout is possible as well. You can either have a cold shower to increase your heart rate and prepare for the cold, or you can have a hot shower to aid your body temperature. Both are fine!\nA shower before a garage gym workout raises your body activity and alertness. It will make your upcoming workout more enjoyable and may even improve your results. And you know that after a workout you can jump in the shower again!\n14. Bring tea As long as you don’t have any heat source in your garage gym, you absolutely should bring tea to your workout. You can drink it between sets.\nYou can simply prepare a bottle of tea half an hour before the workout starts. By then it will have reached just the right temperature for you to drink it. The warmth of the tea will then reduce the need for heating your garage gym.\nAdditionally, drinking green tea before or during a workout increases your fat burn rate significantly!\n“One study in 12 men found that consuming green tea extract before exercising increased fat burning by 17%, compared with a placebo ( source).”\nBenefits of green tea - healthline\nTherefore, there’s no excuse not to drink tea in your garage gym. It keeps you warm and it improves your results and makes you look better at the same time!\nHow awesome is that?\n15. Use a yoga mat Each time you do any kind of workout where you touch the ground, for example, push-ups, crunches, stretching, or similar, use a yoga mat!\nA yoga mat insulates you from the cold ground. You should always avoid direct contact with the cold during a workout. It would reduce your muscles’ mobility and flexibility.\nYoga mats feel pretty warm. That’s because of the thousands of small air bubbles that are trapped inside the foamy material.\nIt is, therefore, another effective way to stay warm in your garage gym. Generally, any kind of yoga mat would work. But when it’s really cold, the best insulating yoga mats are those which are made of cork:\n“Cork is [\u0026hellip;] an ideal material for a yoga mat. The texture is particularly lovely when lying down or practicing in a cold room – it feels snugglier and warmer than a rubber mat.”\nindependent.co.uk about yoga mats\nAlso, yoga mats are easy to store. Just put it in any corner of your garage gym. The cold won’t harm it. That way you always have a yoga mat prepared.\n16. Install a wood stove A wood stove in a garage gym? How would that work? Isn’t it expensive? It’s not!\nYou can use a wood stove kit to turn a regular metal barrel into a wood stove yourself. That’s a really effective and affordable way to heat your garage gym.\nUsing a wood stove would, however, require you to come half an hour before your workout, and preheat the gym with a stove fire. That’s the disadvantage compared to a space heater which you could simply turn on.\nHowever, having a wood stove requires you to chop wood. Which is like another workout you have to do once or twice a year.\nUsing wood makes you independent of the electric grid. In an energy outage, you could always go and workout (if you don’t have anything else to worry about)!\nEspecially, when you can get wood for cheap (or better for free), wood stoves are definitely worth it.\nBut I think for most people, space heaters do the job.\n17. Insulate the roof Whatever you heat your garage gym with, it’s a rule of physics that hot air rises while cold air stays on the ground. But what if your garage gym roof has air gaps. And what if your garage gym doesn’t have proper insulation?\nOftentimes garage roofs are bare metal roofs. Metals, as you might already know, are the best heat conductors and therefore don’t keep any heat inside your gym.\nHaving a metal roof protects you from wind, but it doesn’t protect you from the cold. Having a metal roof is, in terms of heat exchange, about the same as having no roof at all.\nSo, add a layer of insulation to your garage roof. You can do it with an insulation kit or by attaching styrofoam to the roof.\nIf you have an attic above your garage gym, the best way to insulate it is with styrofoam balls or glass fiber insulation (glass wool).\nHere’s a video that shows you how to insulate your attic to keep heat in your garage gym.\n18. Close all air gaps Hot air oftentimes leaks through air gaps. That’s why you should make sure that there are no significant openings where cold air can enter your gym.\nThe most common spots for air gaps are right below your garage door and right below your roof. You can usually close them using a simple door insulation tape or soundproofing material.\nIt will stop the hot air from leaking and the cold air from coming in. Closing air gaps, if you have some, will improve the overall insulation of your garage gym a LOT.\n19. Wear warm ski underwear Warm ski underwear protects you when it’s really cold. But you are not restricted to using them for winter sports. You can always wear thermal underwear during your garage gym workout.\nIt will keep you warm by wicking away moisture from your body. The layer above your underwear will insulate you from the cold. Because of that, you will feel dry during your workout and your sweat won’t cool you down.\nThe best thing is that ski underwear doesn’t limit your movements. Even when you have a workout where you need mobility, ski underwear does not stop you. It is very stretchy and low weight.\nThere’s no excuse for not wearing thermal underwear while doing a workout in a cold gym.\n20. Workout with your spouse or a partner This is not directly a heating tip. But because you’re not alone in your garage gym when you bring your spouse or a partner, the room heats up faster from the body temperature.\nAlso, because you are with someone, the amount of air in your garage gym decreases. Your bodies displace the air in the gym. Therefore there’s less cold air that you need to heat.\nWhen you fire up a space heater, for example, you will notice that it gets warm faster.\nAlso, when you have a workout partner you are more motivated and able to accomplish better performance. You move heavier weights.\nThe improved workout will increase your heart rate and you will feel warmer. Also, having a buddy with you distracts you from the cold.\nbody temperature heats room faster, you are more motivated - achieve higher power (thus higher heart rate and you feel warmer\n21. Bring an electric blanket You can also bring an electric blanket to your workout. This is the absolute last resort! If you still feel cold in your garage gym, having an electric blanket is invaluable.\nBetween every set, you can snuggle up in your electric blanket and warm up.\nDon’t worry about energy costs. Electric blankets cost just a tenth of a space heater to run.\nSo, have an electric blanket plugged in, do a set, and after the set, warm yourself up. Repeat.\nYou can also put the electric blanket on the weight bench while doing your sets there. It will warm up the bench and it will keep your back warm actively.\nHeating systems for garage gyms For most of you, the 21 ways for heating a garage I just mentioned are enough to go through the winter.\nIn case you have some spare money and you want this to be a long-term project, you can also install a central heating system in your garage.\nEven though this might be a bit much for a garage, there are some advantages over other heating methods such as reliability, more heating power and possibly lower long term cost.\nCentral heating options for a garage are:\nWarm-air furnace Hot water boiler Steam boiler They all work in similar ways: One central heating unit heats either water, steam or air which is then distributed using a pipe system and a pump. In some cases, you don’t even need to build a new central heating.\nWhen your garage is close to your home, you are maybe able to build pipes that connect your home central heating with your garage.\nImage by smarterhouse.org\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-heat-a-garage-gym-the-21-best-ways/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt’s freezing cold again and you want to workout.

But they are actually very simple to understand. In this article, I’m going to show you 21 pros and cons of using an infrared vs oil heater, so you know which one suits you best.\nThe difference between infrared heaters and oil heaters is that infrared heaters are designed for quick, directional heat and better efficiency, whereas oil heaters are meant to replace your home heating unit by heating whole rooms evenly and with more strength.\nIn order to learn more about the exact differences between infrared and oil heaters, let’s take a look at all the pros and cons.\n1. Weight Oil Heater Pro: Heavier because of a solid, durable metal body.\nCon: Heavier, less portable.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Light, easy to carry around.\nCon: Big infrared heaters can be heavy as well.\nGenerally, oil heaters are heavier than infrared heaters because of their large oil-filled metal body. Infrared heaters are lighter because they are often built with lighter materials, such as plastic or thin metal.\nAlso, the heating elements of an infrared heater weigh next to nothing. They are light infrared tubes.\nBut there are exceptions: There are some big infrared heaters that can get heavy as well. In the upper price range, where you get big heaters, infrared heaters can become as heavy as oil heaters. So, the weight of an infrared heater and an oil heater depends from model to model.\nMost oil heaters weigh around 25 pounds, whereas most infrared heaters weigh only 10 pounds. However, you can find lighter (mini) oil heaters and bigger infrared heaters which weigh 25 pounds as well.\n2. Size Oil Heater Pro: Big, but compact (not unnecessarily big)\nCon: Sometimes too big.\nInfrared Heater Pro: From small to big - you can find all sizes.\nYou can get infrared heaters in absolutely every size. From very small desk heaters you can use in your office, to really big and powerful heaters that are able to heat whole apartments.\nThe size of an infrared heater is not limited. It’s simple for the manufacturers to change the size of the infrared heating element.\nIn contrast, oil heaters can not get arbitrarily large. Too big models would be too heavy to handle. That’s why you mostly find oil heaters in similar sizes. They are compact and size-efficient. Oil heaters appear big at first. But they need a good size to distribute the heat evenly.\nUsually, oil heaters are one-size-fits-all. Of course, there are some exceptions. You can, for example, find mini oil heaters or oil heaters with very thin heating bodies. By using these you sacrifice heating capacity though.\n3. Heating Speed Oil Heater Con: Slow heating speed.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Fast heating speed. Reaches full heat within a minute.\nHeating speed is mainly determined by the technology that’s used in a heater.\nThe heating speed is one of the fundamental differences between an infrared vs oil heater. And it’s one of the key differences you need to decide which model suits you best.\nDo you need a fast heater or a slow and steady model?\nInfrared heaters are extremely fast. They are the racing cars among heaters.\nIt takes an infrared heater just a minute to get to full heat. As soon as you turn an infrared heater on, you can feel the heat coming out.\nThey are a great solution if you’re freezing and you want to warm up immediately.\nOil heaters need more time. They are the snails among heaters. It takes them several minutes to get warm. The reason is that the metal body contains lots of oil to distribute the heat.\nBefore any heat reaches you, the heater has to warm up the oil first. That’s what takes time.\nBecause of that, oil heaters are good for longer heating periods, for example, keeping a living room warm throughout the evening.\n4. Efficiency Oil Heater Pro: Efficient heating of large rooms.\nCon: Not efficient outdoors.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Efficient heating in small rooms.\nCon: Not efficient heating large rooms.\nBoth heaters, infrared and oil heaters are efficient in their own ways. You just have to know what you want to use them for. Each of them is best in certain applications.\nInfrared heaters produce directional heat (radiation) that heats just space in front of the space heater. That’s why infrared heaters are 40% more efficient than other heaters.\nIt’s because you can focus the heat in one direction. For that reason, infrared heaters are good at heating single persons.\nYou can point the heater at them. But whole rooms are hard to heat using infrared because the infrared rays usually don’t cover the whole room.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a guide on the best infrared heater placements within a room to maximize efficiency (something you can\u0026rsquo;t do with oil-filled radiators).\nIn contrast, oil heaters distribute the heat more evenly. They produce warm air that distributes everywhere in a room. Because of that, oil heaters are better at heating bigger rooms.\nHowever, oil heaters can’t heat outdoors at all. The wind immediately blows the warm air away, whereas the directional heat of infrared heaters withstands the wind. You can’t blow away radiation.\n5. Price Oil Heater Pro: Price-effective.\nCon: Few models in lower price categories.\nInfrared Heater Pro: More heaters in lower price categories.\nOil heaters and infrared heaters both are available in very similar price ranges. You can find most models between $50 and $200.\nHowever, in the lower price range, you can find more infrared heaters. I guess the reason is that they are easier to produce overseas and import than heavy oil heaters. That’s why there are a lot of cheap infrared heaters: They are easier to ship.\nStill, you can find oil heaters for cheap and infrared heaters that are expensive. There are no real limitations for the price you pay.\nHowever, remember that an oil heater is better in heating large spaces. This means that for the same price, you can heat more space. Meanwhile, infrared heaters are more efficient in the long run. The long-term cost to run an infrared heater is usually lower.\n6. Safety Oil Heater Pro: Very safe. Also safe to touch.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Very safe.\nCon: Not safe to touch.\nOil heaters and infrared heaters both come with a vast amount of safety features. From safety certifications to overheat protection, automatic shut-off, tip-over protection, and everything you wish to feel safe.\nHowever, there’s one small difference that makes oil heaters safer by a small margin.\nInfrared heaters emit heat through a focused area where the heat comes out. This area is usually protected by a metal grid, so you can not put your hand inside. Even though the metal grid is a safety measure, it heats up as well and becomes hot to the touch. I tried it myself and burned my fingers.\nIn contrast, oil heaters distribute their heat over a large surface. This way the heat is spread evenly instead of being focused. That’s why oil heaters are usually safe to touch and don’t get burning hot.\n7. Portability Oil Heater Pro: Rollers increase portability.\nCon: Still rather hard to transport compared to other heaters.\nInfrared Heater Pro: High portability, easy to transport.\nWhen you want to move your space heater to another room, portability becomes important.\nBecause of the lower weight, infrared heaters win this point. They are easy to lift and light. Usually, they are already handy to carry or they have a built-in handle to carry them easily.\nOn the other hand, oil heaters also try to do the best they can. Oftentimes they come with rollers, so you can easily move them around. However, oil heaters become really hard to transport when you have to move them upstairs. The rollers are only useful as long as the heater stays on the same floor.\n8. Heating Capacity Oil Heater Pro: Very high heating capacity. Stores and produces lots of heat.\nInfrared Heater Con: Low heating capacity. The heat immediately disappears after turning it off.\nHeating capacity is the amount of heat that the heater stores and emits over time. More heating capacity means more heat and more heating strength.\nInfrared heaters have absolutely no heating capacity. Once you turn an infrared heater off, the heat vanishes immediately. It doesn’t store any heat.\nMeanwhile, oil heaters have a high heating capacity. Even after turning them off, the oil remains how and continues to deliver heat until it cools down. It’s similar to how a hot water bottle works.\nThat’s why oil heaters can heat more evenly and are better in delivering heat over longer periods of time.\n9. Versatility Oil Heater Con: Low versatility. Only useful in closed rooms.\nInfrared Heater Con: High versatility. Useful in many locations.\nOil heaters are best for heating closed rooms. Especially indoor home heating is what they are made for. But they can also keep small wood workshops warm. The issue with oil heaters is that they attempt to heat the air of the room. That’s why they are not useful (compared to infrared heaters) in heating uninsulated rooms. You also can’t use them outdoors at all.\nInfrared heaters are much more versatile. They can heat indoors, in garages, uninsulated rooms, attics and even outdoors. Basically, you can use them wherever you want. The reason is that infrared heat is such a special type of heat that keeps you warm even when the air around you is cold. It’s similar to how sun rays feel in wintertime.\n10. Maintenance Oil Heater Pro: No regular maintenance.\nCon: Hard to fix in case it breaks.\nInfrared Heater Pro: No maintenance. Easier to fix.\nAs long as you’re not an electrician, you shouldn’t do any maintenance jobs on your heater. Still, this point is important in case your heater breaks.\nIt’s possible to let an electrician fix your heater. So here’s the maintenance difference between an infrared vs oil heater.\nInfrared heaters are generally simpler types of heaters you can easily understand. They consist of a power conversion stage and a heating stage. It’s not a big deal for someone who likes electronics to locate the issue.\nOil heaters are a little more complex. They have a similar power conversion and heating stage. However, the heating element is embodied in the metal body and is very hard to fix.\nWhen an oil heater breaks, chances are, you better buy a new one.\nStill, both heaters are maintenance-free and you don’t need to check them regularly.\n11. Design Oil Heater Con: Oil heaters all look about the same. Good designs are rare.\nInfrared Heater Pro: All designs you wish for.\nOil heaters look like typical heaters. And they all look about the same. They have a thermostat attached to a metal body. That’s it. There’s no fancy design and finding a good looking one is hard. Oil heaters are hard to fit in a stylish apartment. At least, you’ll have to spend time looking for a good looking model that suits your purposes.\nMeanwhile, infrared heaters are available in all sizes, shapes, and designs. From what I have seen, you can find models that fit every style you want. The design point goes to infrared heaters.\n12. Comfort Oil Heater Pro: Oil heaters produce even heat.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Dry heat that feels like sunlight.\nWhen you use a space heater all day long, it’s important that the heat it produces feels good and you are comfortable with it.\nMy impression is that infrared heat feels like sunlight. Also, it’s very similar to the heat of a fireplace. It’s very focused heat and it feels like it dries your skin. You might now that dry-skin feeling when you’re sitting at a campfire. Here’s an article on 3 Heaters that don’t dry the air!\nWhen I have my infrared heater next to me while I’m working, it heats only one side of my body, which I don’t really like.\nMeanwhile, oil heaters produce heat that feels much better. The heat does not rely on radiation, but it warms the air, which feels more comfortable. Also, oil heaters heat a room evenly.\n13. Storage Oil Heater Con: Storable, but hard to fit in a small storage room.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Easy to store.\nDuring summertime, you don’t always want to keep your heater in your room. So you need to store it.\nBut which one fits better in a storage room? Infrared vs oil heater?\nBoth heaters are definitely easy to fit in a storage room. Usually, oil heaters are a little bigger and cumbersome which makes them a little harder to store in small rooms. Also, they are very heavy, so you can’t really put them on a shelve.\nInfrared heaters are easy to store. They are smaller and lighter, so you can easily put them wherever you want. And you can take them out easily at any time.\n14. Availability Oil Heater Pro: Available everywhere.\nCon: Hard to find in small local shops.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Available everywhere.\nYou can easily find both heater types online. There’s no difference in availability between an infrared vs oil heater.\nHowever, in local shops, infrared heaters are more present - at least where I live. The reason is probably that they are cheaper, easier to sell and more portable. People would hate buying an oil heater off the shelve and carry it home.\nYou can find both heater types used online. So, you can get even better bargains.\n15. Overnight Use Oil Heater Pro: Safe to run overnight.\nInfrared Heater Con: Emits light which disrupts sleep.\nWhen you use a space heater overnight, what you’re looking for is even and long-lasting heat. Which already gives you a hint on which heater is the better choice.\nAlso, you want it to have sufficient power, even on lower settings and enough safety features.\nImportant note: Only use a heater overnight, when you’re at home.\nInfrared heaters are not suitable for overnight heating. Even if they provide enough heat and come with all the safety features you need. The heating elements of an infrared heater glow red which definitely hinders your sleep.\nIn contrast, oil heaters don’t emit any light and are better suited for heating a room overnight. Check out this article for the 3 Best Oil Heaters to run overnight!\nBoth heaters, infrared and oil heaters are silent at night.\n16. Noise Oil Heater Pro: Very silent.\nCon: Can occasionally make a clicking noise (during heat-up and cool-down).\nInfrared Heater Pro: Silent.\nCon: Makes clicking noise as well.\nBoth heaters are silent as long as you don’t buy special models with a built-in fan. Usually, you can check that in the product description.\nWhen an infrared vs oil heater heats up or cools down, they both can sometimes make clicking noises because of the expanding and contracting surface material. Due to the heat, the material moves a little and makes a little noise when it releases tension. That’s normal and you cannot avoid it.\nHowever, these clicking noises are very rare.\nIt’s also possible that a transformer hums (very) silently or that the infrared tubes hum.\nGenerally, both types of heaters are comparably silent and you can run them while doing concentrated work or while sleeping.\n17. Children \u0026amp; Pets Oil Heater Pro: Child and pet safe.\nInfrared Heater Con: Oftentimes hot to touch.\nIf you have children or pets at home, you want to make sure, that nobody gets injured. So, what’s the better child- and pet safe heater? Infrared or oil?\nBecause infrared heaters have an opening where all the heat comes out, they are usually hot to touch in that area. The opening is usually protected by a metal grid, so you can’t put your hand inside and touch the heating element directly. However, this metal grid gets hot too.\nOil heaters, on the other hand, have a big surface and the heating element is embodied in oil. So, there are no hot to touch spots. Oil heaters get hot, but not hot enough to be dangerous.\nImage by Mark Turnauckas\n18. Outdoor Use Oil Heater Con: Not useful outdoors.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Can be used outdoors.\nWhich heater is best for your next outdoor garden party? Which one should you set up in your party tent next summer?\nBecause infrared radiation heats objects and not air, you can feel the heat even when you are outdoors. That’s why infrared is good for garden parties or garage heating. Also, the heat is directional, which is very handy at parties. Guests who feel cold can stand next to the heater. Others can spend their time elsewhere.\n“Outdoor infrared heaters warm up specific areas and objects rather than the air, you don’t waste energy and save money on your utility bills” infraredheatersdirect.co.uk\nOil heaters are not effective to run outdoors, because they try to heat the air. Outdoors, the wind would blow away any heat. Oil heaters are a waste of energy when you run them outdoors.\n19. Thermostat Oil Heater Pro: Better thermostats.\nInfrared Heater Con: Usually not as good as oil heaters.\nGenerally, temperature control is working fine with both space heaters. For most infrared vs oil heater, you can find the temperature controls in two different designs.\nEither it’s a simple power switch where you can set the power you want (usually 750W or 1500W). Or it’s a more advanced thermostat where you can set the exact temperature you want.\nFrom an engineer’s perspective, it’s easier to control the temperature of an oil heater because it heats the air that surrounds it. So, the thermostat measures the current temperature, then compares it to the one you set and makes automatic corrections.\nWith infrared heaters, that’s more difficult because the infrared rays are harder to measure.\nThat’s why most (but not all) infrared heaters come with simple power switches and oil heaters have a thermostat.\nBut you can find both types of controls for both heaters.\n20. Stability Oil Heater Pro: Very stable. Built with solid and heavy materials.\nInfrared Heater Con: Usually rather fragile.\nOil heaters are more stable than infrared heaters because of their heavy metal body that encases the oil. It’s their design that makes them stable. Oil heaters have to withstand changes in pressure (because the oil heats up) and therefore they have to be reliable.\nInfrared heaters are often cheaper and less stable. With a plastic surface and parts that are not as solid as they should be. But when you think about it, infrared heaters don’t really need to be stable at all. All they do is emit heat. They don’t carry a huge load of oil compared to oil heaters.\nThat’s why oil heaters are more stable than infrared heaters.\n21. Durability Oil Heater Pro: Very durable. Lasts up to decades.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Durable, but a little less than oil heaters.\nBoth heaters have no moving parts. So, they can’t wear down. This makes both heater types (infrared vs oil heater) very durable.\nHowever, I always see tons of used oil heaters for sale online (on eBay or craigslist) that people found in their garages. They seem to last for decades.\nInfrared heaters usually consist of less durable materials, which is why they don’t last as long as oil heaters.\nCompared to other types of heaters (ceramic for example), both infrared and oil heaters are very durable.\nInfrared vs Oil Heater - Which to Choose? Answer: Infrared heaters are better for you if you want quick heating on all occasions and you want to be versatile with your heater. On the other hand, oil heaters are the better choice to replace a heating system and reliably heat a large room long-term.\nWhich one do you prefer?\nYou can easily find out which type of heater you need by creating a checklist for each of the points in this article.\nWrite down a plus and a minus for each point you like and don’t like. Then, you can count the score (add plusses, subtract minuses) and find out which one scores better for you personally.\nAttributions: Title image - Pelonis Oil-filled Heater \u0026amp; Air Choice Infrared Heater\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/infrared-vs-oil-heater-21-pros-and-cons/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere are clear differences between an infrared vs oil heater.

In this article, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at exactly that.\nI\u0026rsquo;m Daniel, an electrical engineer from Germany, and here\u0026rsquo;s a list of all the cheapest practical ways to heat your home!\nSome of the methods listed teach you cheap ways to heat single rooms. Also, you\u0026rsquo;ll find cheap ways to heat your entire house. Some of the heating-methods listed don\u0026rsquo;t even need central heating or electricity!\nIf you prefer to save hundreds of dollars every year, you are in the right place. And it’s simple! Saving energy is a lot easier than you think. So, don’t worry, be ready!\nIn this article, I’m going to show you the 21 cheapest ways to heat a room. Some of them involve heating the room, other ways are about keeping yourself warm. You’ll also learn a few smart tricks to save money or get cash back.\nHere are the cheapest and most efficient ways to heat a room.\nCheapest ways to heat a room 1. Use an energy-efficient space heater to keep warm at home By using a space heater, you heat just the room you’re in. And nothing else. You can, therefore, lower the temperature of your central heating and carry the space heater with you everywhere you go.\nAlternatively, you can also go and buy one space heater for each room you frequently visit in your house. This way you won’t have to carry one heater around with you all the time.\nContrary to what most people think, space heaters are not that expensive to operate. Yes, they increase your electricity bill. However, they can lower your utility bills even more (if you use space heaters correctly).\nIt’s like shifting the expenses from one bill to another. In total, your costs won’t increase but decrease.\nThis way, using an energy-efficient space heater is one of the cheapest ways to heat a room. For quick heating, I suggest using an infrared heater. Infrared heaters provide instant heat and are 40% more efficient than other types of heaters.\nI recommend the Dr. Infrared Heater (click here to view it on amazon ). This space heater will serve you for years to come.\nInfrared heaters are so efficient because of their heat distribution capability. Infrared heaters radiate the heat in one direction only. Regular radiators just heat the air, which then rises to the ceiling and is wasted there.\nBy pointing an infrared heater directly at you, you don\u0026rsquo;t waste any power heating the entire room.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my full guide on the best infrared heater placements for maximized heating efficiency.\nFor longer heating periods, oil-filled heaters are the best choice, because they are able to heat larger rooms more evenly.\nJust make sure the heater you buy comes with various safety features like overheat protection and an automatic shut-off timer. Generally, the more safety features it has, the better.\nIn the winter months, I place this infrared heater on my desk. Then, I don\u0026rsquo;t need to turn on the central heating as much.\n2. Buy a smart thermostat to cost-effectively control the heat in your home A smart programmable thermostat controls the temperature in your home in a very energy-efficient way.\nIt decreases the temperature when you’re not at home and starts heating again when you come back. This way it heats only when it’s really necessary.\nYou can program a smart thermostat freely:\nFor example, you can automatically lower the temperature at night, then turn it off when you go to work in the morning and then preheat your house for a cozy movie night right before you come home.\nSounds good? Yes!\nA smart thermostat saves you money in the long run. Here’s how much.\nAccording to ecobee, a popular thermostat company, a smart thermostat can save you up to 23% on utility bills.\n“ecobee customers in the US saved up to 23% on their heating and cooling costs, based on an internal analysis conducted on October 2, 2013.”\necobee savings report\nIn an average American home, a smart thermostat would save around $150 per year. What an investment!\n3. Pay your utility bills with credit cards This one is not possible with all credit card companies, but some allow it. Some credit cards give you a cashback bonus when you pay with them. Therefore using them as much as possible can benefit you.\nBut even if you don’t get a cashback, you can save money by paying with credit cards.\nPaying bills on time with your credit card helps you with your credit score. This, in turn, will save you money in the long run by increasing your trustworthiness with banks.\n“It\u0026rsquo;s important to make sure there’s enough credit available on your bill-paying credit card to cover all the new transactions.”\nLaToya Irby - Credit expert\nOf course, you shouldn’t go into debt with them. This would harm your credit score. And the interest rates would cost you even more money.\n4. Make use of budget billing Your utility company averages your previous year’s payments to predict your future energy usage. This way they can charge you the same fee each and every month. By using budget billing, your utility bills get very predictable.\nBudget billing improves your ability to plan your budget.\n“Utility budget-billing plans might be a good idea for homeowners and renters who want a little more predictability in their monthly payments.”\npracticalmoneyskills.com\nBut not only that: Budget billing is like shifting your winter expenses to summer. This way you actually make use of inflation.\nIf we assume constant energy rates and no budget billing fees, this would effectively save you money because the bill decreases due to inflation.\nFollowing the laws of inflation, a bill that you pay in the future becomes less and less expensive.\nWhat I like most about budget billing is that you know your expenses upfront. So, you can plan to save and invest money regularly and get a good return on your investment.\n5. Insulate your attic Your attic is your home’s biggest heat sink. Especially when you don’t insulate it properly, it’s becoming a significant money pit.\nA properly insulated attic is a terrific money-saver and a worthwhile investment to keep the heat in your house.\nBecause warm air rises while cool air stays on the ground, heat will leak through uninsulated attics.\nLuckily you can do the insulation yourself. Even though you have to invest some money in insulation materials, you will make your money back within a short time.\nSimilar to other investments in this article, you pay once but benefit for a lifetime. Insulation is one of the cheapest ways to keep heat in a room.\nHere’s a simple and helpful video that shows you how to insulate your attic as a weekend project.\nIt’s pretty simple: All you need is fiberglass insulation and a few tools you already have at home.\n6. Add a carpet to your room The laws of physics force cold air to accumulate on the floor. Which leaves your feet cold all the time. Because you want to save money on heating, you can’t afford to blast heat into your room until your floor gets hot as well.\nEven in a sauna, the floor is comparably cool.\nThat’s why you should add a carpet. It will help a lot with feeling warm and comfortable in your room without actually increasing the temperature.\nInstead of having your feet touch the cold, bare floor, a carpet will insulate your floor and keep your feet warm.\nHaving a carpet in your room also limits the amount of air that cools down on the floor. This way, your room will stay warm for longer.\nA carpet is a simple and easy-to-install insulation.\n7. Wear Slippers In my opinion, everyone should wear slippers. They just help SO much with keeping your feet warm. Especially for people with lower blood pressure who have cold feet and hands all the time, slippers are a must-have product.\nThey separate and insulate your feet from the cold floor.\nAdditionally, slippers that cover the top of your feet create a warm air pocket, similar to how bedsheets work when you are sleeping at night.\nEven though you don’t actively heat your bed, the sheets keep you warm.\nSimilarly, even though your slippers don’t produce any heat, they keep your feet warm. Which will make you feel warmer overall.\nThe warm air is produced by your body temperature. Slippers simply prevent the warm air from escaping.\nCheap way to keep warm in a room without electricity: Wear slippers. Ugly, but effective.\n8. Wear warm clothing Another point you shouldn’t underestimate is warm clothing. Just by wearing warmer clothes, you can significantly cut your energy cost. Warm clothing is probably the cheapest way to heat and stay warm in a house.\nWhy?\nFirst, you don’t need an active energy source. You don’t need access to electricity or fuel to keep warm. And additionally, clothes cover 90% of your body, which makes them very effective. Secondly, you don’t need to buy anything new. You already have all the clothes you need at home. To stay warm, all you need to do is to put on another layer of clothes at home. I like to wear a thin cotton jacket at home.\n“Don’t shed that sweater when you get home. Instead, wear warm clothing inside and turn your thermostat down.”\nmoney.com\nAccording to the California Energy Commission’s Consumer Energy Center, you can save up to 5% on heating costs if you drop the thermostat by just one degree. Accordingly, dropping it by 3 degrees will save you 15% every month. With warm clothes, that’s no problem at all.\nWearing warm clothes makes dropping the thermostat easy. You won’t even feel the difference.\n9. Install solar panels Installing solar panels on your roof is beneficial in many aspects. Let’s not look at the environmental advantages, but on how you can save heating costs with them\nFirst off, you can save lots of money if you tax deduct your solar panels. Additionally, there are other government-supported options, especially for solar panels.\n“You can save 30% on your solar installation with the federal investment tax credit (ITC)”\nenergysage.com\nIt’s like the government supports your utility bill expenses. Which opens another range of possibilities for you. I’m sure there are even more tax deductions you can make. For example, when you’re selling the electricity you produce.\nAs long as you use the energy for yourself, using solar panels decreases your dependency on the electric grid. It reduces the amount you need to draw from the electric grid. Also, you can store excess energy in solar batteries and use it to power your home at night.\nHowever, solar panels are only effective if you live in a state with lots of sunshine - if you do, definitely consider installing some.\nMy parents once gave me a helpful tip to quickly find out whether you should install solar panels or not:\n“As long as your solar panel seller doesn’t have panels on his own roof, it’s not worth installing them.”\nmy parents\n10. Install a hot water storage tank on your roof When I visited France once, each and every single building had its own hot water storage tank on its roof.\nThat’s a big water tank that is heated by the sun. Which is especially worth it in warm states with lots of sunshine.\nIt’s a method to produce energy that relies on temperature instead of the intensity of sun rays. Because of that, hot water storage tanks produce water even on cloudy days as long as it’s hot outside.\nEven though this might cut your heating bill a little, it will not be too significant, because most of the energy is produced in mid-summer, where you don’t need much heat anyway.\nThat’s why hot water storage tanks are only worth it on special occasions.\n11. Heat only rooms you use This one is especially important. So important that you should always do it: Heat only the rooms you use.\nThe reason is that if you have a 5 room apartment and you spend your time in just one of the rooms while heating everywhere, you waste 80% of the energy.\nAccordingly, if you only heat the rooms you use, you could save 80% of the energy. And it’s so simple: All you have to do is turn on the heater when you enter a room and turn it off (or low) when you leave the room.\nTherefore, one of the cheapest ways to heat a house is to NOT heat the house, but just the room you’re in.\nYou can implement this simple strategy using a regular space heater:\nKeep your house at mild temperatures using your central heating. Meanwhile, carry a space heater with you everywhere. Whenever you enter a room, turn the space heater on and let it heat.\nThis way you only produce heat where you need it to be. Space heaters produce focused heat that is very efficient in small spaces.\nIf you use your central heating unit, it first has to heat a big oil-tank before you can send that heat to just one room. It sounds like a waste of energy to me.\n12. Use an electric blanket You can heat even cheaper than using space heaters. By using an electric blanket.\nElectric blankets are like regular blankets, warm and cozy. But they have built-in heating elements that produce additional heat.\nIf you use an electric blanket, you don’t heat your whole house, you don’t even heat your room. You heat just yourself, which is very effective because it’s such a small space. Generally speaking, the smaller the size of the space you heat, the cheaper you heat.\nAn electric blanket is so effective because it heats only the air that’s trapped between your body and the blanket. Compare that to the amount of air to heat in your room and you see, why an electric blanket is so efficient.\nBecause it produces heat for such a small space, an electric blanket needs very little power. In contrast to using a space heater, which needs about 1500W to operate, an electric blanket keeps you warm with just 100W to 150W.\nThat’s just a tenth of the energy and therefore a significant energy-saving method.\n13. Use a gas heater In rooms without any electricity, gas heaters are a must-have because they can produce a lot of heat in very short times.\nGas heaters are generally great for garages and laundry rooms where you have no access to electricity or your outlets are already occupied.\nThe best thing about gas heaters is that you don’t rely on your central heating to produce the heat, which is often a very slow process.\nInstead, you can fire a gas heater up quickly and it will produce heat immediately.\nWhat I like most about them is that once you hook them up the gas tank, they seem to last forever.\n“A standard 20lb. propane cylinder will last for up to 10 hours in an outdoor gas heater.”\nnorthlineexpress.com\nThe cost of running a propane heater is about $1.60 per hour - this might sound like a lot at first, but if you remember that you don’t need to run it continuously, and switch it on and off when you need it, it can be worth it.\nLike other space heaters, propane heaters are best to heat single rooms and provide heat quickly.\n14. Wear a hat A warm winter hat can save you money and reduce your needs for heating. But how?\n\u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a hat on, you lose heat through your head, just as you would lose heat through your legs if you were wearing shorts.\u0026rdquo;\nSusan Davis\nWearing a hat gives you the ultimate benefit of saving energy yourself. By keeping yourself warm you don’t feel cold and don’t need to heat anymore.\nDuring wintertime, a warm winter hat is a great investment. You probably have one lying around anyways. You can even wear them to sleep to save additional money at night.\nDuring the warmer seasons in spring, a regular cap will do the job as well.\nHowever, wearing a hat indoors is socially awkward, so you should only do it when there are no guests at your house.\nIt’s best to discuss wearing a hat at home with your spouse. Just to avoid unnecessary arguments later on.\n15. Install a wood stove to heat your entire house cheaply Wood stoves produce heat without any significant expenses. If you know how you can keep your whole house heated for a few bucks. But it takes time and effort.\nIf you like chopping wood and you think you need to spend more time outdoors anyway, why not install a wood stove to heat your home for cheap?\nIt can make a great manly hobby! And your whole family will thank you for the heat you provide.\nWood stoves also make a beautiful atmosphere together with the calm crackling noise of the fire. Are you ready for a few romantic evenings with your spouse?\nThe price range of a wood stove is very broad. You can get them from as low as $100 up to $5,000 depending on what you want.\nI’m sure you find something that suits your needs. You just need a little spare money.\nChopping wood is a great hobby. It saves you money. It provides heat twice (while chopping and while heating). Also, it’s good for educating kids to help you and appreciate the effort behind heating a house.\nAll you need is access to wood.\n16. Leave doors closed to control the heat in your house Always leave doors closed. This one might be obvious when you read about it, but I always see people missing to close the door behind themselves.\nWhen you spend time in a room with an open door, you often feel a cold stream of air at your feet, because cold air comes in from outside.\nIt’s so simple to avoid this money trap: Just close the door whenever you enter a room.\nIt also reduces the area that needs to be heated. With an open door, you’re effectively heating multiple rooms at once. Remember our important rule: Always heat just the room you are in.\nIf you leave your doors closed, you can also produce more heat in a shorter time.\n17. Install black window curtains Black window curtains produce free heat! Just install them on a window that faces the sun.\nWhen sun rays hit the black curtains, they heat up slightly (remember: black color attracts heat). Because your curtains are indoors, the heat cannot escape anymore. Your window reflects it.\nTherefore, black curtains installed behind a window trap the heat. It’s very similar to how a greenhouse works.\nEven though this will give you results, you can’t really measure the amount of energy it saves you.\nThat’s why I suggest black window curtains only if you already heat your room for cheap and you want to optimize the last few percent.\n18. Wash your hands with cold water Whenever you get cold hands or feel cold overall, wash your hands with ice-cold water. This will force a counterreaction:\nBecause your body wants to keep your body temperature stable, it wants to counteract the heat loss at your hands. Therefore, your body warms up, your blood flow improves and you feel warmer overall.\nOf course, it feels awful while you are holding your hands under cold water. But after a few minutes, your hands will warm up again and you feel better.\nAdditionally, using cold water doesn’t require any heating expenses, because it’s cold. It’s like you produce heat from nothing.\n19. Do jumping jacks regularly If you spend a lot of time at your desk working, studying, reading or something similar that does not involve any movements, you often start feeling overly cold because your heart activity decreases.\nTo boost yourself, get up and do 30 jumping jacks whenever you feel cold.\nPersonally, I love to do it whenever I feel like my hands and feet are getting cold. It’s also great for supporting your brain activity.\nWhenever you have to do concentrated work, jumping jacks are beneficial in two ways. They keep you warm and they reactivate your brain.\nBy doing jumping jacks, you avoid turning up your heater more and more.\n20. Go outdoors A walk outside is relieving. Especially when it is cold outside, going outdoors is a great idea. When you have a walk in the cold, your body adapts to the cool temperatures and produces more heat. That’s why you feel so comfortably warm when you enter your home again!\nEven if going outdoors when you feel cold seems counterintuitive, it’s not! It increases your bodies’ resistance to the cold and helps you stay warm without using the heater.\nOn top of that, a walk is healthy and relaxing. You should be doing it more anyways (me too)!\n21. Use a hot water bottle Finally, here’s another useful and effective way to cheaply heat in a room!\nRunning a kettle to boil your water costs next to nothing. It costs only 1 or 2 cents to heat the water to fill a hot water bottle that can keep you warm for 30 minutes to 2 hours ( source).\nIn big rooms, a water bottle will stay hot for 30 minutes, wheres in your bed it will provide you with heat for up to 2 hours.\nHow water bottles are an incredibly cheap way to heat your room. You focus the heat just on yourself (similar to electric blankets). Absolutely no energy is wasted to heat the air in the room you are in.\nEven if you boil 10 hot water bottles to stay warm throughout the evening (5 hours), that’s only 20 cents of heating costs.\nIn contrast, a regular heater would cost about $0.40 to $1.50 to heat for the same time.\nAlso, hot water bottles are cheap (compared to a wood stove or solar panels)! It costs around $10 to become a proud hot water bottle-owner. That’s a very small amount for so much value!\nConclusion - The 21 Cheapest Ways to Heat a Room Most of the cheapest ways to heat a room I gave you in this article involve heating just what’s necessary. Heat only the room you’re in. Be as efficient as possible.\nThis way you can save hundreds of dollars each year. That’s money you can freely spend elsewhere.\nAlso, you can reduce the need for heat by staying active: Jumping jacks or having a walk outdoors will increase your body temperature. If you do these things you stop freezing and you don’t need to turn up the thermostat.\nEven if you pick only 1 or 2 of these tips, you will make a significant impact on your heating bill! So, chose one of these cheapest ways that you like to implement to heat your room and start saving money!\nMy personal favorite cheapest way to heat a room is by using a space heater.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/the-21-cheapest-ways-to-heat-a-room/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhat are the cheapest ways to heat your room or even your entire house?

You want to finally get a new heater and you want to get it NOW! But there’s one thing holding you back: Your budget.\nThis article is just for you. We’re going to cover absolutely everything you need to know about cheap space heaters:\nPersonally, I own a cheap heater well below $50 and it’s running reliably for months now. I’ll answer your questions:\nWhich ones do the best job for under $50? What are the long term electricity costs for them? Can you afford one? Will using a space heater save you money or will it be a money pit? Where do you start?\nAll these questions need an answer BEFORE you purchase a new space heater model. Only then can you pick a space heater that fits your needs and reliably keeps you warm.\nAdditionally, I’ll give you helpful financial principles for saving money on space heaters. We’re going to cover how to troubleshoot a space heater yourself before calling an electrician (to save money).\nWe’ll also discuss whether used space heaters are worth getting. And how to make sure you get your money’s worth.\nWhat to buy Do you need Brands? Do you actually need to buy space heaters of known and popular brands such as Dyson, Dr. Heater, or De Longhi? At first, this might sound like a reasonable idea. Popular brand models are oftentimes better in terms of quality and durability. Right?\nWell, not really. In fact, there’s evidence that the quality you get from expensive brands does not always match what you pay.\nIn my experience, popular brands oftentimes really have better quality, look and feel. Their models seem like they are better than cheap alternatives.\nHowever, there have been several scandals around popular brands like Phillips that artificially limit their product lifetime to two years (right after the warranty). That’s called “planned obsolescence”.\nConclusion:\nEven if you spend only $50 on a space heater, you need to get your money’s worth. And you don’t even need to worry about quality in this price range because expensive products are not necessarily better.\nFrom what I have seen, brand models appear better at first. But in the long run, they do not perform any better than other models.\nSometimes it’s even the other way around: I switched from brand products to non-brand products which appear to last a lot longer. That’s why we’ll look out for reliable products, with great customer ratings and the best bang for your buck, instead of just brands.\nGet rid of the idea that you need to get a Dyson heater: You have $50 to spend - that’s your limit - and regular heaters will heat just as well.\nBest Space Heaters under $50 for each occasion To get the most for your money you have to know what you want to use your heater for. It makes a difference whether you want to heat a children’s room or a wood workshop in a garage. Actually, it makes a really big difference!\nFor each occasion, a different heater is best. and to maximize the value you get for your money you have to pick the heater according to what you want to use it for.\nLet’s take a look at reliable indoor and outdoor heaters.\nIndoors Indoor heaters are usually suited for heating closed rooms. They come with various safety features such as knock-over protection and overheat-protection to prevent accidents.\nHere are the best indoor space heaters you can get for under $50.\nBest Indoor Space Heaters under $50 NamePricePELONIS PH-17P (Amazon link)$36multifun Space Heater (Amazon link)$34noname portable space heater (Amazon link)$37Lasko Tower (Amazon link)$45\nPelonis PH-17P: Pelonis is a great brand and one of my secret tips! They offer lots of security features with their heaters and are safety certified. I can’t recommend this brand enough. multifun Space Heater: Don’t let the small size fool you. This little buddy is very powerful! Even if it looks unsuspicious, it can easily keep large rooms warm. For under $50, that’s incredible! Additionally, it has by far the most positive user ratings. From heating trailers to living rooms: This space heater is your best choice under $50. noname portable space heater: I just had to include this one because it’s one of amazon’s absolute bestsellers. It has over 13,000 user ratings! Still, some ratings are not very positive and I’d personally stick to other the other models. Lasko Tower: One of the few tower heaters you can get for that price! An absolute must if you prefer the tower-look. My recommendation: The multifun Space Heater is by far the best-rated model among our four candidates. It looks cool, even a little industrial. Because of its heating power, reliability and because it’s ETL safety certified, I’d definitely get this model!\nHowever, that’s just a personal preference. The other models are good as well. Check all of them out before you make a personal decision!\nOutdoors\nYou want to heat a garage or a greenhouse? In this section, you’ll find the best cheap outdoor space heaters under $50.\nThe differences between outdoor heaters and indoor heaters are simple:\nDesign: Outdoor heaters often look more industrial and simple. Power: They can produce a lot more power than regular heaters. Safety: They have fewer safety features. Outdoor heaters oftentimes get hot to the touch for example. Fuel: Outdoors you don’t always have access to electricity. That’s why they’re often powered by propane, kerosene or diesel. My favorite outdoor heaters run on propane gas. Usually, they are best to use when you need lots of heat in cold locations without insulation.\nHere are the best outdoor space heaters for under $50:\nBest Outdoor Space Heaters under $50 NamePriceProCom Tanktop Heater (Amazon link)$36Texsport Portable (Amazon link)$50Dyna-Glo Tanktop Heater(Amazon link)$45\nPropane outdoor heaters are usually in higher price categories. That’s why all you get below $50 is simple tanktop heaters. Even though they provide lots of heat, they are not really aesthetically pleasing.\nThese 3 heaters are all just fine for keeping garages and greenhouses warm. My recommendation is the Texsport Portable, which is the most reliable and durable model.\nUsed Space Heaters As you see, you don’t get to buy the “Walk of Fame” of space heater brands if you want to stay below $50. However, there’s something you can do:\nI found that you can get incredible deals on used space heaters. Even brand products like DeLonghi or Dr. Heater.\nSpace heaters are one of the few things I have never seen anyone buy used. For some reason, everyone buys them new.\nHere are a few reasons for and against getting a used space heater to save money\nPros Supply and demand: Think about how many garages there are with unused, lost space heaters people forgot about. The supply of used heaters is MUCH bigger than the demand. Especially when you buy anti-cyclic, meaning you buy them in summer when the demand the lowest.\nA simple search on craigslist or eBay will reveal some hidden gems. I found heaters for as low as $10 that worked perfectly fine.\nOn craigslist, there’s a chance that you get to pick one up for free. Chances are the seller just wants to get rid of it. Access to brands: Under $50, you’re having a hard time finding products of popular brands. When you look for used heaters, you have a much bigger chance to get one! Age: Most heater types don’t age. Even if they were decades old. That’s why you’ll find dozens of infrared or propane heaters that you can buy for cheap. They don’t have any moving parts and there’s nothing to wear down. So, there’s no difference between new and used heaters. Space heaters are very durable. Back in the days even more than today.\nNothing stops a 10-year-old heater from running another 10 years. Cons Noise: Old heaters with built-in fans can make a rattling noise because they are worn down. That’s why you should rather get space heaters with built-in fans new. Oftentimes, but not always, new heaters are quieter than old heaters. Old-fashioned: Used heaters oftentimes are several years old and therefore oftentimes appear old-fashioned. You will find lots of them when you browse for used heaters. Just skip them. You can still find recent products that are just a year old and look modern. Faulty electronics: When somebody keeps his heater in a storeroom or a garage for years (or decades), there’s a chance that electronics are faulty. Usually, sellers tell you in the product description. However, I would prefer getting a heater that the seller used and now sells, because he wants a newer model. What to look out for when getting a cheap used heater I think the pros of getting used space heaters outweigh the cons. Especially if you just want to heat and you don’t care about having the newest model.\nBut before you buy a used heater, here’s what you should look out for:\nToo old models: Don’t get too old models. They simply lack safety features. Instead of looking for 10 or 20-year-old heaters, I would rather prefer heaters that are 1-5 years old. This way you make sure you don’t buy a potential hazard. Product description: Read the product description. Why is the seller selling? Does his heater make noise? Is it a model that you really want? Remember what we discussed before: Each type of space heater is useful for a certain application (indoor, outdoor). Make sure you find one that suits your purposes.\nYou can also ask the seller questions about noise, energy usage, etc. if you’re not sure. Budget: Don’t exceed your $50 budget. Even if it’s an awesome deal, stick to it. Know your budget Budgeting is extremely important in all areas of your life. Especially when you buy something that will not only cost you money once but also long term (electricity bill). That’s why you have to check the cost of your heater carefully.\nIf you set yourself an upper boundary of $50, stick to it. There are dozens, if not hundreds of space heaters below $50 that will suit your purpose. For each scenario, there’s one space heater that suits you best. You can find a suitable space heater in absolutely any price range. You don’t need to exceed your budget to find a good heater.\nHere’s a rule I found very helpful:\n“If you can’t buy it twice, you can’t afford it.”\nread it somewhere - can\u0026rsquo;t remember where\nThat does not only apply to heaters, but also to hiring electricians, buying a car, a TV and everything else.\nDon’t let the purchase of a space heater drain your money. A common mistake is to think “I buy it only once, so it has to be the best model”. This mindset leads to over-purchasing: Buying things that are way beyond your budget. A house that’s too big, a car that’s too fast, or a space heater you can’t afford.\nDo not buy a space heater on credit card Don’t let the purchase of a space heater drain your money. If you have nothing left for the month, shift your purchase to next month. Save your money and buy it once you can afford it.\nNever let your bank account reach zero. And never ever take on credit card debt for a space heater.\nIt’s one of the worst things you can do.\nNot only will you have to pay monthly interest for your heater. Space heaters (like other products) lose value over time. They need electricity to run and cost you monthly.\nIt’s like paying more for something that’s worth less with time and on top of that it increases your electricity bill.\nIf you’re looking for a space heater for under $50 because you’re broke, the best way to afford a heater is to save money and spend it afterward\nElectricity costs of a space heater: Can you afford it? Even if you can pay for a space heater upfront, you shouldn’t forget about the monthly electricity costs of a space heater.\nThe electricity cost is defined by three variables:\nYour personal electricity rate (how much electricity costs in your area), the power usage of your heater, and the time you use your space heater every day.\nIn another article, where I calculated the electricity cost of 21 different space heater models, I found that a space heater with 1500W of power will cost you $40 each month. Assuming you run it for 8 hours every day.\nAccordingly, if you cut your usage time in half, the costs halve as well. Running a space heater for 4 hours every day would add $20 to your electricity bill each month.\nTo check whether you can afford it, you can create an excel spreadsheet and list all your income vs. your expenses. Does the additional cost fit in?\nI found this rule of thumb very helpful for deciding whether you can afford to buy something:\n“As long as you’re buying it in cash (aka not putting it on your credit card unless you pay that sucker off in full right after) and it doesn’t compromise your ability to handle your regular bills and your other commitments, go for [it].”\nthefinancialdiet.com\nIt takes into account the upfront cost (“buying it in cash”), but also the long term regular costs (“ability to handle regular bills”).\nRunning a space heater is not as expensive as you think Space heaters increase your electric bill. That’s out of question. But if you use a space heater, you generate heat which your home heating unit doesn’t need to produce anymore.\nSo, while your electric bill increases, your heating bill (fuel, oil, gas) decreases.\nThink of it as cutting expenses from one bill and moving it to another.\nTwo scenarios are theoretically possible:\nThe space heater you buy is more efficient than your heating system. Meaning that your heating bill (oil, fuel or gas) will decrease more than your electric bill increases. This effectively saves you money. Or your space heater is less effective than your heating system. This will increase your electric bill by more than the amount you save on your heating bill. This costs you money. Which of these two scenarios applies to you is very hard to guess. It depends on how you use your space heater: How often you turn it on, how efficient it is, and whether it is the right heater for your needs.\nBut no matter whether you save money or pay money: A space heater will move a part of the costs from your heating bill to your electric bill. That’s why it is not as expensive as it appears when you calculate your electricity usage.\nHow to check the space heater yourself and save money For safety, it’s always a good idea to check your space heater and make sure it’s running properly.\nHiring an electrician to check your space heater regularly is out of your budget.\nElectricians usually charge a high hourly fee. Even if it’s just a space heater check, it gets costly quickly.\nYou can also save the money by checking \u0026amp; troubleshooting your space heater yourself\nI’m an electrical engineer myself, so here’s what I suggest to look out for when checking your space heater.\nBad signs Screeching noise: Does your space heater make unusual noise when it’s plugged in? A screeching noise is bad. It’s a sign of a faulty transformer or broken wires. Tip-Over Protection: Turn your space heater on and tip it over. Does the tip-over protection work? Timer: Set a time (if your heater has a built-in timer) and check whether your space heater automatically shuts off. Power cord: Does the cord heat up? If yes, that’s a potential fire hazard. A cord should always stay cool. Overheating: Does your space heater get unusually hot? Smell: Does your space heater smell? Burnt or gassy smell is always a bad sign. In case your heater shows one of these bad signs replace it. Fixing space heater yourself is dangerous. And having an electrician fix it is more expensive than buying a new heater.\nSpace heaters are high power devices, which you shouldn’t attempt to fix yourself.\nGood signs / Signs not to worry about Clicking noise: Space heaters oftentimes make clicking sounds. These sounds come from expanding and contracting surface material or the thermostat that switches power. They are nothing to worry about. Humming noise: A humming noise is fine as long as it’s not overly aggressive. A calm humming noise (like the silent humming of a light bulb) is okay. Working safety features: Perfect! Check your space heater for these signs regularly. This way you save tons of money by not needing an electrician!\nAre cheap Space Heaters safe? When you’re looking for the best space heaters under $50, you might also wonder about whether cheap heaters are safe as well?\nAnswer:\nYes, cheap space heaters are safe. They have exactly the same conditions to enter the market as expensive heaters. Some cheap space heaters are even safety certified (like the one I recommended in the list above).\nCertifications prove that the space heater you are about to get is safe to operate. Even under absurd conditions like running it in unusual positions or knocking it over regularly. A certified heater is a good heater.\nIn fact, there’s no difference in safety between cheap and expensive heaters\nWhat makes expensive heaters more expensive is not safety, but better materials, advanced temperature control, and other fancy extras.\nBy saving money, you don’t risk safety.\nWhen NOT to buy a Space Heater under $50 Here are some reasons not to buy a space heater under $50 and save money instead.\nMaterials: Space heaters under $50 are often made of cheaper materials than their expensive competitors. If you like better materials, save your money. Thermostat: This one is not true for all heaters. But oftentimes expensive heaters have better thermostats that balance the temperature more accurately. Optics: Higher-priced models look better than cheap models. Noise: If you prefer smooth, balanced noise an expensive fan heater MIGHT sound better than a cheap heater. Of course, there are exceptions and this point is not always true. Money: Don’t buy a heater at all if you don’t think you can pay for electricity. Electronics: If you don’t feel confident with electronics, you might worry too much about your heater. Safety: You worry about safety. With more expensive products, you buy the feeling of safety (although there’s no evidence that they are safer). Best price range for space heaters From what I’ve seen, you can get very good space heaters in the $50-$100 range - and you can get lifetime buddies from $100 and above.\nUsually, you can tell how good and reliable a space heater is by the ratings online.\nHowever, sticking to space heaters under $50 is fine as well if you can’t afford expensive ones yet. I’m running a $25 heater every day and didn’t have any issues whatsoever.\nThere’s no difference between heat from an expensive heater and heat from an inexpensive heater.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/best-space-heaters-under-50-a-complete-guide-to-the-cheapest-ones/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s cover the best space heaters under $50!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone who’s new to space heaters knows this feeling.

Here\u0026rsquo;s everything you need to know!\nIn this article, we\u0026rsquo;re comparing the electricity cost of 21 different space heaters!\nI’ll help you decide whether you can afford to run a space heater. And also, I am giving you a simple formula to calculate the exact electricity cost of your space heater model.\nQuick answer: A space heater costs $54 per month to run if you use it for 8 hours every day. I assumed an average 1500W space heater and the average US electricity rate of 15 cents per Kilowatt-hour for the calculation. If you run your space heater on lower settings or for shorter durations, the cost to run your space heater decreases accordingly.\nTo better follow along with this guide, I’ve included as much data on space heater types, power usage, and electricity cost as possible. The data will give you clear information on how a space heater impacts your electricity bill.\nTo find out how much a space heater will cost to run, we will:\nCheck 21 different space heaters of different types and different wattages. I’ve already calculated the costs for them. Learn how to calculate custom electricity costs yourself (with a simple and straightforward formula) Take a look at the efficiency of space heaters and learn how to run them in a cost-effective way. So, let’s start!\nHow much does a space heater cost to run? (I\u0026rsquo;ve checked 21 different models) Let’s take a look at 21 examples of space heater electricity costs. In the table below you’ll find some of the most popular space heaters, listed with their type, their power consumption and their cost per month.\nBut you can also find some niche products like a 4,800W garage heater. So you can find a heater that is similar to the one you plan to get.\nTo calculate the average costs, I assumed that you run your space heater for 8 hours a day on maximum heat settings. Of course, you’ll save accordingly if you lower the heat.\nThe space heater electricity costs are based on the average price per kilowatt-hour in the US:\nThe average residential electricity rate in the U.S. is 14.92 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).\nsaveonenergy.com\nLet\u0026rsquo;s round that up and set the average electricity rate to 15 cents per kilowatt-hour.\nA look at 21 different models and their costs Here are the results:\n**HeaterTypePower in W****Monthly cost in $**Lasko 106Ceramic2007.2AmazonBasics HeaterCeramic50018Bojing Portable IndoorCeramic90032.4DOUHE PortableCeramic90032.4COMLIFE HeaterCeramic120043.2Duraflame 3DInfrared150054Lifesmart EasyInfrared150054Vornado VH200Electric150054Lasko 754200Ceramic150054Dr Infrared HeaterInfrared150054De\u0026rsquo;Longhi TCH8093ERCeramic150054Honeywell HCE200WCeramic150054Lasko AW300 Air LogicCeramic150054Heat Storm HS-1500-PHX-WIFIInfrared150054DeLonghi EW7707CMOil-Filled150054Pelonis HeaterOil-Filled150054Dyson Pure Hot + CoolElectric157556.7Stiebel Eltron CKT 20EElectric200072Cadet RCP402SElectric4000144NewAir NGH500GA00 Garage HeaterElectric4800172.8Dr. Infrared DR-910FElectric10000360\nAs you see, the cost to run a space heater depends only on the power consumption of it. It doesn’t matter whether it’s an infrared or oil-filled heater.\nFor example, all heaters that operate on 1500W will cost you about 54$ per month. It doesn’t matter which type or brand they are.\nAnd it doesn’t matter whether your space heater is cheap or expensive.\nLet’s assume you plan to get a new space heater. To predict the electricity costs of it, basically, all you need to do is to find another heater from the list above that has a similar power rating. All 1500W heaters cost the same.\nImportant Note: The electricity cost of a space heater doesn’t tell you anything about the space heater’s efficiency. That’s a different story. Keep reading to learn more.\nHow to calculate space heater electricity cost The space heater costs above assume that you run your space heater for 8 hours every day. Also, the space heater costs above are based on the average electricity price of about 15 cents per kilowatt-hour in the US.\nBut what if you want to run your space heater for shorter or longer periods of time? And what if your electricity price is higher? For example, in Massachusetts, the average price is about 24 cents per kilowatt-hour.\nWell, then you’ll need to calculate your own custom space heater electricity cost prediction.\n3 Steps to find your electricity costs Here’s how you can do it.\nFind the electricity costs per kilowatt-hour in your home (or your state). You can do that by looking up your last electricity bill. Or you can take a look at the infographic in the next section which shows the average US-household electricity costs by state. Then, decide how long you’re going to run your space heater each day. If you want to run your space heater for 8 hours per day in wintertime and 1 hour per day in summertime, you can also estimate the average amount of hours to be in between those two. Use this formula to calculate your own space heater electricity cost prediction:\nSpace heater cost per hour = electricity cost (in dollar per kilowatt-hour) * power (in watt) / 1000 Here’s an example:\nMike wants to get a new infrared heater. But he’s worried about his electricity bill. So, he looks up the electricity costs in his state:\nHe finds that in Michigan, his electricity rate is 15.46 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is the same as $0.1456 per kWh.\nTo calculate the cost for his infrared heater of 1500W, he uses the formula:\nCost per hour = $0.1556 * 1500W / 1000 = $0.2319 per hour\nWhich is about 23.2 cents per hour.\nTroubleshooting:\nIf your result looks a little weird, here’s what could have possibly gone wrong with your calculations\nCommon mistakes:\nYou calculated with the wrong metrics: cents instead of dollars (15 cents per hour instead of $0.15 per hour) You forgot to divide by 1000 Average Electricity Rates by State Source: howmuch,net\nUsing this infographic you can easily look up your electricity rates. If you’re from another country, a quick google search will do the job.\nI’ve found it interesting that according to statista.com, in Germany you pay the highest rate of $0.33 per kWh while in Argentina, it would only cost you $0.01 per kWh.\nWhat space heater electricity cost depends on Let’s take a quick glance at the formula below.\nSpace heater cost per hour = electricity cost (in dollar per kilowatt-hour) * power (in watt) / 1000\nour formula\nAs you can see it depends on just two parameters. The first one is your personal electricity rates. The second one is the power usage of your space heater in watts.\nYou can find your electricity costs per kWh by looking at your last electricity bill. And you can easily find the power your space heater needs to run on the packaging or on the space heater itself.\nUnderstanding that costs depend entirely on these two factors is important.\nThat’s why no matter which 1500W space heater you buy, you always have to pay the same electricity cost.\nIt’s a myth that space heaters that claim to be eco-friendly really decrease your electricity bill. As long as they consume the same power as other heaters, they will cost the exact same.\nTo decrease the electricity cost, a space heater has to decrease the power usage and therefore (most likely) also decrease the heat it produces.\nConclusion:\nTwo space heaters with the same wattage will both cost the very same to operate.\nHow much power does a space heater consume? As you can see in the table above, most space heaters consume 1500W of power.\nThe reason is that 1500W can deliver a good amount of heat while still being safe to run in your home circuit.\nHeaters that use less power are even safer to run. However, they don’t heat very well. Similarly, heaters that use more power are less safe to run in your home circuit. But they can produce much more heat.\nIt seems like 1500W is the optimum amount of power for regular home space heaters.\nHowever, there are also other types of space heaters for special applications. That’s why you can also find small 200W heaters on the list. They are small but can keep your hands warm in an office. And you’ll also find heaters up to 10,000W. They are best to use in industrial applications or in big, uninsulated garages (by the way, here’s a link to a guide on how to heat an uninsulated garage).\nGenerally, power consumption has nothing to do with the type of heater you use. Each type of heater (infrared, ceramic, oil-filled, …) is available on different power levels.\nPower consumption gives you a hint on how much heat your space heater can deliver.\nBut there’s another metric that’s important:\nEfficiency.\nLet’s take a look.\nWhich space heater is the most efficient? Power is not the only parameter that impacts the heat output. Efficiency is similarly important.\nDifferent types of space heaters are efficient in different use cases.\nFor example, for quick heating, infrared heaters are most efficient, because they can heat up within a few seconds.\n“Typically an infrared heater just 40% the size of a traditional convection radiator will produce the same level of comfort. So a 1kW convection heater will produce the same level of comfort for the occupant as a 400w infrared heating panel.”\nthegreenage.co.uk\nHowever, infrared heaters are not the best choice for heating whole rooms. They are only 40% more efficient than other types of heaters, because they focus the heat in one direction. You can point the focused heat in any direction and heat just that part of your room.\nIn contrast, oil-filled radiators are the most efficient heaters to keep a whole room warm.\nEven though they need more time than infrared heaters to heat up, they can produce lots of warm air once they get going.\nHere’s something only a few people understand:\nEfficiency depends on your usage There’s not one type of space heater that’s most efficient. Efficiency depends on what and how you want to heat with the heater.\nHere’s a small list on (what I believe) each space heater is best to use for:\nInfrared heaters - for heating yourself or limited space in a room Ceramic heaters - for heating small rooms quickly Oil-filled heaters - for heating large rooms (rather slowly) Propane heaters - for lots of instant heat (also in locations without power supply) How to use a space heater efficiently to reduce electricity costs Up until now, we’ve discussed which parameters impact space heater costs. It’s electricity rates, power usage, and efficiency.\nIf you combine them all to get a bigger picture, you get: Usage.\nElectricity costs depend on how you use your space heater. Which power settings do you select? And which space heater do you use for which occasion?\nLet’s take a look at an example.\nIn the list above, I’ve included a few bigger sized garage heaters. For example, the NewAir NGH500GA00 Garage Heater. It uses 4800W (!), which is more than three times the power of a regular heater.\nThe calculations for space heater electricity costs are all done assuming you run the space heater for 8 hours straight. But nobody will leave a garage heater on for 8 hours a day.\nThe heater is just too powerful and you probably don’t need all the heat. You also wear thick clothes when you’re in a garage.\nIf you like to spend time in your garage, you can, for example, heat in short bursts. For example, you run the heater for 10 minutes and then turn it off for an hour. Then you heat, turn off, heat, etc. (over and over again).\nLet’s call it heat cycling.\nUsing heat cycling, you decrease the total hours that your space heater runs. Let’s estimate that over the course of 8 hours, you heater ran for about 1 hour.\nThis would decrease heating costs from $138.24$ to $17.28 per month.\nThat does not only apply to garage heaters but all types of heaters:\nAll the examples in the list assume that you run your heater on maximum power for 8 hours every day - which you mostly don’t need, because you can heat cycle. Still, the results provide a good estimation for your electricity costs\nHow much does a space heater cost per month? Short answer:\nA space heater will cost about $324 to run per year. However, that doesn’t mean you lose $324 every year. Running a space heater reduces your heating costs. Basically, you save on heating costs (oil, propane, …) and add these expenses to your electricity bill.\nHow to calculate yearly costs:\nBased on what we already know about space heater electricity costs, it gets fairly simple to find out how much a space heater costs per year.\nLet’s assume you use the space heater for 8 hours per day in wintertime (6 months).\nWe already know that running a 1500W heater for 8 hours a day costs you $54 every month.\nThis means in a year, it will cost:\nYearly electricity costs = 6 months * $54 = $324\nAnswer: A 1500W space heater will cost an average of around $324 per year. Depending on the state you live in this price varies up and down.\nThese costs, however, don’t leak out of your pocket. When you use a space heater, you mostly reduce other home heating usage.\n“The common methods of heating a home are with an oil furnace, gas heater or hot water boiler. These units require fuel fill-ups on a regular basis and in some cases electricity usage to keep the heater\u0026rsquo;s motor running.”\nbudgeting.thenest.com\nThat’s what you save on when you use a space heater. You need less fuel to power other heating systems.\nIt’s like you shift your heating cost from your old heating bill to your electricity bill. You don’t really lose the money.\nWhat’s the best way to save electricity cost There are dozens of ways to save electricity costs. When researching them I wasn’t really satisfied. The engineer in me awakes.\nI found all kinds of tips, ranging from letting the sun shine through your window to dressing properly. However, I’m not really satisfied with them for two reasons.\nThey are ineffective. You can’t measure your results directly. In my opinion, from an engineer\u0026rsquo;s perspective, there are two ways to effectively save electricity costs. Once you do these two things right, your electricity costs will drop.\nWhy decreasing your thermostat saves you money The first thing to do is: Decrease the thermostat.\nMost space heaters and other heating systems have a built-in thermostat or some other way to control the power.\nHere’s why:\n“Turn your thermostat down. Reducing it by 1°C could save you energy and money (c.£75 per year)”\nnef.org.uk\nThe amount of power to heat a room by just one single degree increases really fast. It needs much more energy to increase the temperature from 79 degrees to 80 degrees than increasing it from 69 degrees to 70 degrees needs.\nAccordingly, the reverse is also true:\nReducing the temperature by just 1 degree will make a significant impact on your electricity costs. Even though it doesn’t impact your well-being.\nInsulate The second way to reduce your electricity bill long term, even if you’re running space heaters, is to make sure you have proper insulation.\nInsulation will reduce the need for heating. Once you heat your room, the warm air will stay warm for longer, because cold air doesn’t leak anymore.\nIn contrast, if you’re trying to heat a room without a door (which I’ve already written an article on), you’re wasting tons of energy.\nYou just have to do something in order to keep the heat in your room. You don’t need to add professional insulation. Even adding a simple carpet if you don’t have one, or closing the door will help a lot.\n“Insulation will help you keep the desired temperature in your house all year round, protecting it against cold in winter and excess heat in summer.”\ngreenmatch.co.uk \u0026quot;\nConclusion An average 1500W space heater costs around $54 per month to run 8 hours a day. This value applies to most households. A day of 24 hours will consist of 8 hours of work, school, or university, 8 hours of sleep, and 8 hours of free time.\nWe’ve also taken a look at 21 different examples of real, popular space heater models. For each of them, I’ve included the electricity costs together with the type of heater and the amount of power is used. From the results, you can see, that the electricity costs depend mainly on the power usage of your heater.\nIt doesn’t matter which heater type it is.\nAlso, local electricity rates impact your space heater costs. You can find your personal rates on your last electric bill and then do the calculations with the formula I gave you.\nSo, the best way to decrease your costs is to use your space heater efficiently.\nFor example, using a small, 800W infrared heater is a total waste of energy, because it won’t get you anywhere. Similarly, using a 1500W heater to keep a small storeroom hot is a similar waste of energy.\nFor each scenario, a different heater is best. For example, infrared heaters are best for heating certain spots in a room. Oil-filled radiators and ceramic heaters are best to heat entire rooms.\nSo, use your space heater wisely.\nBy reducing your space heater costs, you don’t only favor yourself, but also the environment.\nSaving electricity is one of the few things that harms nobody, but benefits everybody.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/space-heater-electricity-cost-a-look-at-the-costs-of-21-different-models/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow much does a space heater cost to run?

(21 Heaters Tested)"},{"content":"How to keep heat in a room without a door? That’s one of the few questions humanity fails to answer. While we know everything about applied thermodynamics and heating options, we get a chill when we spend time in a room without a door.\nCold air comes in from the open door and you don’t know what to do about it.\nBut you don’t need to worry! You will stop freezing today!\nHow to keep heat in a room without a door Keeping heat in a room without a door is easier than you think and I’m going to teach you how to do just that.\nYou’ll need to\nFind a way to keep hot air in the room. Consider additional heat sources. Upgrade your room a little. In order to learn everything about how to keep the heat in a doorless room, keep reading!\nTips and Tricks 1. Keep heat using simple insulation Here’s our first tip: Use a wool blanket to insulate the heat. As long as you leave your room open, there will be an increased airflow.\nSo, even if you heat the room, the temperature increases only slowly, because there will be a heat exchange with the hallway or other rooms.\nTherefore, the very first thing you can do to keep heat in a room without a door is to tuck a wool blanket to the doorframe. You can either install it provisionally using a few nails to secure it to the open door frame, or you could use a curtain rod to hang the blanket there.\nIn this case, you could alternatively also use thick curtains instead of a wool blanket.\nBy using a wool blanket to insulate heat, you limit the airflow into and out of your room.\nEffectively, the blanket limits the space you need to heat and creates a warm air pocket.\n2. Use the radiator, but store the heat In case the room you want to keep heat in has heating, here’s another thing you can do.\nYou’ve probably seen massage stones before. What if you use them to store the heat in your room?\nI first had this idea when I noticed the rising air that comes out of a radiator. To keep the heat in a room without a door, one thing you can do is to limit the movement of the air.\nBy placing massage stones on your heating, the airflow is limited and the heat energy is stored in the stones.\nMassage stones increase the heat storage in your room and heat will stay there for longer periods of time.\nOf course, this is not only possible with hot massage stones. In theory, you could use all other kinds of stones as well. But I’ve found that they have a good heat capacity compared to regular stones you find outdoors.\nDon’t try to place anything flammable on the heating! Stones are the safest heat storage.\n3. Use an infrared heater for additional heating I found that whenever I felt cold in a room even though I turned the heating on, a small, powerful heat source was missing.\nSo, I bought an infrared heater I can use as an additional heat source. The best thing about it is, that it’s portable and you can run it anywhere you want.\nInfrared radiation heats objects, not air. It’s like the warm sun on an early summer morning. Even though the air is still cold, you feel the warmth of the sunrays. That’s similar to how infrared heat feels.\nThe best thing about it is, that whenever you want to keep the heat in a room without a door, you don’t rely on heating the air itself (which will eventually move out of the room). Infrared heat doesn’t heat the air. It heats precisely the object it shines on.\nIn my home-gym (which has no door), I use an infrared heater to quickly add some warmth to the room. To do so, I simply point it at my workout area and it’ll keep me warm while I’m working out.\nOther heaters would heat the air, which would quickly disappear.\nIn a room without a door, an infrared heater is an awesome investment for additional heat.\n4. Carefully test the heater If you use an external electrical heater in your room that has no door, please carefully test it before using it extensively.\nI’ve found that rooms without doors are often side-rooms that you don’t use that often. So, the wall outlets are not built in the safest possible way.\nFor simple safety reasons, you should test the heater.\nTo test it, here’s what you can do:\nStart heating with the lowest power settings. Leave the heater on for 30 minutes. This shows you whether the outlets can handle the current your space heater draws. Increase the temperature of your heater and leave it on for another 30 minutes. Have a window open and make sure the room is vented. By doing so, your heater will off-gas. Harmful gases that could be dissolved in the materials of the heater will party evaporate. Congrats!\nYour heater is now ready to heat. Don’t worry, you have to do this test only once. After that, you can run your heater without worries.\n5. How to set the right temperature in a room without a door “Heating and cooling account for 50% to 70% of the energy used in the average American home.”\nenergy.gov\nTo make sure you heat your room efficiently, you should set the right temperature on your heating.\nToo high heat will be inefficient: As long as your room has an open door, the hot air will not stay.\nToo low heat will not be enough to heat your room properly.\nI’d suggest setting the temperature of your heater (depending on the outdoor temperature) between 60-80% of full heat.\nBut if you have your door “closed”, as suggested in the first tip, you can lower the power settings to 40-60%.\nAs you see, as soon as you have insulation (like a wool blanket that covers the open doorframe), you don’t need to waste so much energy on heat anymore. The insulation will trap the warm air and keep the heat.\n6. How often and for how long do you enter the room? Is it a room in which you spend time regularly? How much time do you spend there? Just a few minutes a day or many hours?\nI’m asking because if you spend only a few minutes there every day or you go there only occasionally, you’ll need a quick heater that is able to provide heat as fast as possible.\nFor example:\nMy home gym has no door. Turning on the heating doesn’t help at all, because after the time it takes to heat up, I finished my workout.\nFor such a case, where you don’t spend long durations of time in your room, a quick heater that can provide heat instantly will help you a lot.\nThat’s why I use an infrared heater. It reaches full heat after 15 seconds.\nIn case you spend more time in that room, you’re just fine with the normal heating. It’ll take more time to heat up, but you don’t need to get another portable heater.\n7. Point the heater in the right direction This might be an obvious tip, but if you forget about it, your room will lose heat rapidly. To keep the heat in a room without a door, you have to place your heater in such a way that it points toward the center of the room.\nTherefore, the heat will accumulate in the center and stay there.\nIn contrast, if you point your electric heater toward the open door, you’ll lose a lot of heat. Especially if you use an infrared heater, the radiation that shines through the open doorframe is lost forever.\n8. Preheat the room Do you know you want to spend an hour or two in that room? To feel more comfortable, preheat it.\nEven if there’s no door, preheating will help a lot in keeping your room warm. And you don’t need to wait until the heating turns on.\nI love to preheat my living room when I know that in half an hour I want to read a book there.\nPreheating is only necessary when you’re producing the heat using your home’s central heating. Generally, it is slow and needs some time to get hot.\nIf you want to heat using an electric space heater, you don’t need to preheat at all. Usually, they are very fast and heat up within a minute.\nSo, instead of preheating, you could also turn the central heating on and then boost the heat for a few minutes with a space heater. This will give you quick heat in the first few minutes and when the central heating is hot, you can turn off your portable space heater.\n9. Which temperature is too much? Sadly, there is no perfect answer to this question. Even if I would name a temperature that suits me best, it will not be the best temperature for you, because we’re all different.\nAs we previously discussed, you should set higher heat settings to make up for the heat that escapes out of the door.\nFor finding the perfect temperature, you can start with around 75% of the heating power:\nWhen your heater has 5 power settings, use power level 4. Or when your heater has 1500W, set it to around 1100W (if possible).\nMostly, that’s a good level of heat. Then, you can increase or decrease the temperature according to your needs.\nIf you have set-up a blanket that covers the open doorframe as I suggested in tip 1, you can lower your settings.\nUsually, you don’t need to max out your heating power settings when you’re using powerful heat sources like the central heating or propane heaters.\nHowever, when you’re relying on less powerful electric heaters, you can run them on full heat.\n10. Are convection heaters good in doorless rooms? Convection heaters are heaters that distribute the heat using the movement of air. Convection heaters are, for example, your central heating or electric ceramic heaters.\nGenerally speaking, in rooms that don’t have a door, using a convection heater is not a good idea. Even if they produce heat effectively in closed rooms, in doorless rooms, they are not the best choice.\nWhy?\nBecause if you heat up air that can leak through an open door, the hot air will escape because it wants to mix up with cold air. That’s simple physics.\nIt’s like you’re trying to swim up a waterfall. You can try to do it, but it’s not the best way to get up there. The best way is to get a helicopter.\nIn our case, the helicopter that we need to keep our room warm, is an infrared heater. It does not heat the air, but the objects it shines on.\nTherefore, infrared heaters are the most efficient types of heaters to keep warm even with an open door.\n11. How to properly size a heater for a room without a door? To stay warm in a room without a door, an infrared heater is a great investment. Honestly, my infrared heater was one of the best presents I’ve ever got (thanks to my girlfriend!).\nBut which size of a heater do you need to keep warm in a room without a door?\nI love to spend time reading books in our living room. When it’s cold, I grab my infrared heater and point it at my feet. It makes you feel so comfortable.\nMy heater has only 800W of power. But that’s definitely enough to keep me warm in a room with an open door.\nHowever, if you want to heat a room for multiple persons, you should definitely get a bigger type of heater.\nGenerally speaking, 1500W heaters are the best choice. Most of the time, they provide enough heat. And you can even save energy by lowering the power settings to 1000W or 750W.\nIf you want to calculate the exact amount of power your room needs, here’s how you can calculate it.\n“Estimate 10 watts per square foot and multiply the square footage of the room by 10. A room with 144 square feet will require 1,440 watts.”\nSpace Heater Sizing Guide\nPay attention: When your room has no door, you have to not only count the square footage of that room but also the square footage of the room it’s connected to!\nExample:\nYou have a room with 144 square feet that connects to a hallway with 50 square feet. That means that the total amount of space your heater needs to heat is 144 + 50 = 194 square feet.\n12. Use propane heaters in rooms without electricity I’m a big fan of propane heaters. Even though they work by heating up the air (which wastes energy), they are very practical for heating rooms that don’t have electricity.\nAll you need to do is to hook up a propane tank and you’re ready to go.\nSo, if you’re looking to heat a garage or a greenhouse, a propane heater is a great choice.\nBut for rooms without a door, infrared heaters will be superior. They are more efficient.\n13. Wear slippers To keep warm in a room without a door, please wear slippers. Slippers will insulate your feet and block off cold air that enters from outside.\nIf the room you’re in isn’t warm at all, slippers will at least double your wellbeing (at least they do that for me).\nIf you’re not a slippers-type of person, you should still give them a try. I bet you’ll not regret it!\nHaving cold feet is one of the main reasons, you’re feeling cold overall.\n14. How will heating a room without a door affect your energy bill? From an engineer’s perspective, heating a room without a door affects your energy bill in the same way as simply heating a room of a bigger size.\nLet’s revive the previous example:\nA 144 square feet room that is directly connected to a 50 square feet hallway is exactly the same as one 194 square feet room.\nAssuming that the hallway has no own energy source we can say that the hallway increases the total size of the room by roughly 25%.\nAnswer: The energy bill will increase according to the size of the room without a door plus the rooms that it is connected to.\nThis way you can also see the benefit of insulation: By separating the hallway and your room (for example using a blanket or by adding a door), you’ll decrease the size of the area to heat by 25% and save money accordingly.\nThe area you need to heat decreases when you install a door. This cuts your energy bill.\n15. Close other rooms Rooms without doors are usually connected to other rooms or a hallway. By closing all the doors of the rooms it is connected to, you limit the amount of space you need to heat.\nIf you keep all the rooms in your apartment open, the heated air will distribute among these rooms.\nTherefore, you need more energy to keep the temperature up and it will take much longer to heat the room you’re in.\nAlways make sure you don’t unnecessarily heat space.\n16. Put down a big carpet This one does not directly keep the heat in your room without a door, but it will make you feel so much better.\n“If your floors feel cold, put down a rug. It sounds simple, but it’s more helpful than you may think. ‘Not only will a rug keep your feet from feeling cold, but it actually adds a layer of insulation.’”\nNew York Times\nIf you don’t have a big carpet yet, get one! It insulates your feet from the cold, bare floor.\nYou probably know that hot air rises. That’s why cold air accumulates on the floor. Therefore, you’ll feel a lot colder than it actually is.\nWhen you put down your feet on the carpet, small warm-air-pockets form on the sole of your foot, which the carpet traps. These pockets provide additional warmth and make you feel a lot better.\nWhen I first installed a carpet in my student’s dorm, it was a total game-changer. It improved my life quality a lot.\nAs long as you don’t have a carpet on your floor, you’ll feel unnecessarily cold.\n17. Add a door If you’re regularly spending time in a room without a door, consider simply adding a door. I know this one is obvious and there might be reasons why there is no door yet.\nHowever, in the long term, having a door will always pay for itself. It reduces the energy bill significantly.\nEven if you don’t do the work yourself and hire someone to install the door, it will be worth it in the long run.\nA door is the best and simplest form of insulation between rooms. If you don’t have one, you’ll always heat air that distributes among other rooms. It’s a waste of energy.\n18. Talk to your landlord if you rent the home The previous tip (install a door) doesn’t really work if you don’t own your home. If you’re renting, you can’t decide these things yourself.\nBut:\nWhy don’t you speak to your landlord? I’m sure he will understand the issue.\nIf he is okay with adding a door, he might even pay for it, because it’s his property.\nExplain the need and desire to him in a way he understands. Landlords are always interested in increasing the value of their property.\nBy adding a door, he will increase the worth of his home (even if it’s only slightly). That’s why most landlords agree on such little upgrades.\nFor them, the money does not disappear, but it ends up being part of their property. And your landlord can tax write off the expenses! That’s why it’s cheaper for him to install a door than it is for you.\n19. Consider a wall carpet Wall carpets - some people love them, some people hate them. If you’re one of those people who think that wall carpets can look good, consider getting one in your room without a door!\nWall carpets don’t have to look like lost ancient artifacts. They can actually add a nice look to your room.\nA wall carpet also insulates walls and effectively keeps the heat from leaking through your walls.\nBut before you install a wall carpet, please somehow cover the open door first. First, make sure you cover it with a blanket or provisionally install a (cheap \u0026amp; simple) door.\nOtherwise, the warmth that you keep thanks to your wall carpet escapes through the open door.\n20. Keep warm with the right clothes To keep warm in a room without a door, you don’t always have to heat the room. This brings a lot of hassle:\nIt increases your energy bills. You’d have to install things to insulate the room. Maybe you’d need an electric space heater. Why don’t you simply dress warmer?\nMy parents always said:\n“There’s no bad weather, only bad clothing!”\nmy parents (every time I complained about rain or cold)\nMake sure you wear slippers. Put on another pullover. Wear two layers of socks.\nIf you dress warmly, you don’t need to worry about how to heat effectively. Of course, you want to heat the room a little, but you don’t need to waste time on designing the optimum energy plan.\n21. Health and wellbeing are more important than saving energy If you, however, spend lots of time in your room, make sure you don’t get too greedy with your energy bill.\nYour health and wellbeing are more important than saving energy.\n“Cold homes can cause high blood pressure and even heart attacks and pneumonia. They can also lead to social isolation, loss of sleep, stress and mental illness.”\nCentre for Sustainable Energy\nMake sure you feel good in that room. Turn up the heat if you feel cold. Don’t limit yourself, because you want to save a few cents on your electricity bill.\nSpending time sitting in a cold room is a waste of life quality and decreases your enjoyment of every-day things.\nYou can’t properly read a book if you feel cold. And you can’t watch TV if you feel cold.\nSo:\nTurn up the heating, grab a blanket and make yourself comfortable!\nConclusion - How to keep heat in a room without a door Answer: To keep heat in a room without a door, the best thing you can do right away is attaching a wool blanket to the doorframe. It acts as a windshield and limits cold air that enters your room. Also, it decreases the area you need to heat and increases efficiency.\nIf you had to pick only one tip from this list, that will instantly help you keep the heat in your room without a door, I’d definitely use the wool blanket.\nIn case covering the open doorframe is not possible, you should at least have a powerful infrared heater prepared that supplies additional heat and keeps you warm even if the door is still open.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/how-to-keep-heat-in-a-room-without-a-door-21-helpful-tips/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow to keep heat in a room without a door?

It was really comfortable and I totally concentrated on the book. All of a sudden, there was a loud clicking noise. It was a quick clicking sound, just like the sound you often hear right after turning on an oven or an air conditioner.\nBut what is that noise and where does it come from?\nIn this article, we cover the two most common reasons why space heaters make clicking sounds.\nAdditionally, you’ll learn how to hear the difference between a properly working space heater and a faulty one. After reading, you’ll know exactly, whether the clicking, crackling or popping sound is a good or bad one.\nSo, let’s start.\nWhy does your space heater make a clicking noise? Even though all space heaters have different designs and work in different ways, there’s one thing, nearly all of them have in common: Sometimes they produce clicking noises.\nSo, it doesn’t really matter which kind of heater you have. The following two reasons fit every heater type.\nExpanding surface material makes a clicking noise I’ve had this so many times. And it’s not limited to space heaters. Lots of devices that produce heat, click at some point.\nExample:\nI own a small, portable oven with a metal surface. Every other day I bake something with it: A few buns for breakfast or a pizza for dinner.\nAfter about 5 minutes of shutting the oven off, there’s a sudden, crashing “booom”-sound.\nI jump every single time.\nAnd this sound occurs each time I use the oven. The same thing happens with space heaters.\nBut where does it come from? After some time, I realized that it must be the surface material of the oven:\nWhen it heats up, the metallic surface experiences internal tension, because metals expand when they heat up.\nThe metallic surface of the space heater releases the tension in sudden bursts, which you perceive as the loud clicking noise.\nTension can release during heat up and during cool down, depending on the design of your heater.\nMy space heater always clicks when it heats up (sometimes it’s also a popping or crackling noise), whereas my oven always clicks when it cools down. I believe it’s the surface design and shape that is the biggest impacting factor when your heater clicks.\nIn the space heater domain, mostly oil-filled radiators produce these clicking sounds, because of their metal surface.\nBut the clicking does not occur on metal surface heaters only:\nI’ve had the clicking noise with my plastic infrared heater as well - even though the surface is not metallic.\nThere seem to be internal metal elements that that contract, expand, tense up and click.\nLuckily:\nThe clicking noise of a space heater is not dangerous at all. It’s just a sudden release of tension - nothing to worry about.\nYour space heater uses a two-point control Most space heaters have built-in controls to produce the right temperature and protect them from overheating (Oh, I love that topic, I’m a control engineer).\nSuch controls can work in a smooth way:\nThe higher the temperature gets, the lower the power we give the space heater - this effectively lowers the heat and prevents overheating. If the temperature starts dropping again, the control automatically slowly increases the power. That’s how a thermostat works.\nBut oftentimes in space heaters controls work not in a smooth, but a harsh way:\nWhen the temperature exceeds a threshold, the control turns the power off. And when the temperature drops below a lower threshold, the power turns back on again.\nWe call such an on-off control a two-point control (or two setpoint control). Two-point controls are very common in space heaters (instead of of a “smooth” control), because:\nIt is cheaper to develop. It is safer \u0026amp; easier to shut big amounts of current on and off than to limit them. Because the engineers designing the space heater need to switch on and off big currents, the best electric switch to do so is a so-called relay.\nA relay is an electric switch that mechanically switches connections. Each time it’s switched on or off, a piece of metal bumps onto another piece of metal - that’s where the clicking noise in your space heater comes from.\nThis is what a relay looks like.\nI liked this explanation:\n“The clicking sound is the arm moving between the contact points when the coil is energized or switched off”\nmsplines - electronics expert\nTherefore, the clicking noise is not dangerous at all. It’s actually a healthy sign of a properly functioning temperature control.\nAre there space heaters that don’t make a clicking noise? There probably are space heaters that don’t make any clicking noises. However, I never had one.\nIf I had to get a space heater that never makes a clicking noise, I’d look out for infrared heaters - possibly with a wooden surface. Wood is flexible and doesn’t click.\nAlso, I’d look out for space heaters in a higher price range. It is likely that more expensive space heaters use better thermostats than the simple on-off controls that are often used in cheaper space heaters.\nBut generally, even the safest space heaters sometimes make a click. As long as you know it’s safe and your space heater is working properly, it shouldn’t bother you.\nIs noise an indicator of failure - Is your space heater broken? But what if you’re not sure about the noise that comes from your space heater?\nAs we now know, the clicking noise is not dangerous at all - as long as it’s just clicking noise.\nScreeching noises in space heaters In contrast, a sharp screeching and squealing noise could indicate failure.\nIn my experience of working with and designing electronic circuits, screeching noises always have to do with improper power conversion in space heaters.\nWhen you plug your space heater in the wall outlet, a transformer first transforms the voltage to a lower level.\nSquealing or buzzing noises nearly always come from a broken transformer.\nWhen a transformer doesn’t work properly and you plug it in the outlet, it receives high voltage and current it can’t handle. The transformer starts vibrating aggressively and a screeching noise comes out.\nA screeching or squealing noise is a sign that you should replace your space heater.\nThe metal layers of a transformer vibrate and produce noise.\nWhat about humming noise? “The alternation current that flows through an electrical transformer’s coils has a magnetic effect on its iron core. It causes the core to expand and contract, resulting in a humming sound.”\nD\u0026amp;F Liquidators\nA humming noise is a healthy sound that doesn’t indicate any defects. It often occurs when infrared lamps heat up, or when transformers work properly.\nThe noise of a space heater fan is obviously fine as well - fans always make noise.\nWhat to do if the noise annoys you? If your space heater makes annoying noises, I’d advise getting a new heater.\nGenerally, the most silent heaters are infrared heaters or oil-filled radiators.\nWhile both of them can make a clicking noise here and there, they only do them seldom. While they’re heating they don’t make any continuous noises, because they don’t have any noise-producing parts like built-in fans.\nIn contrast, electric heaters with built-in fans are the loudest types of heaters. Oftentimes, you can already tell by the reviews online whether a space heater is quiet or not.\nThe reviews are a good starting point you can refer to before getting a new, quiet space heater.\nConclusion - Space Heater makes clicking noise: Why? Answer: Your space heater makes a clicking noise because the surface materials are expanding and creating tension when they heat up. At some point, the tension releases and creates a clicking noise. After that, tension starts building up again, and after a few minutes, there will be another click.\nThe second possible reason is that your space heater controls the temperature using a so-called two-setpoint control, where the space heater turns on and off over and over to retain the same temperature level. Switching on and off is done using an electric switch - a so-called relay - that produces the clicking noise.\nThe clicking noise is not harmful at all.\nIf your space heater produces unhealthy-sounding screeching or squealing noises, it is likely that the internal power conversion (the transformer) doesn’t work properly.\nSuch noises usually indicate, that your space heater is broken and that you should get a new one.\nI hope, you could get some insights into how space heaters produce clicking noises and you can now tell whether your space heater noise is “good” or “bad”.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about space heaters, check out the other articles here.\nAttributions: title image by Aaron Yoo ( CC BY-ND 2.0)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/space-heater-makes-clicking-noise/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour space heater makes a clicking noise and you’re not sure where it’s coming from and whether your heater is broken?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve had this myself: I was comfortably sitting on my couch, with my infrared heater keeping my feet warm.

Sometimes even so much that it makes you uncomfortable.\nThe level of humidity in your room can make a big difference for your wellbeing.\nToo dry air will make your skin feel dried out and your throat can get sore. Too humid air will make you feel sweaty at home.\nSo, there must be an optimum point of humidity that is best for your health and wellbeing.\n“The majority of adverse health effects caused by relative humidity would be minimized by maintaining indoor levels between 40 and 60%.[\u0026hellip;] Humidification should preferably use evaporative or steam humidifiers.”\nStudy- Indirect health effects of relative humidity in indoor environments.\nEspecially during wintertime, the air can become really dry. When you use a space heater even though the air is already dry, the heated air will feel like you’re in a desert.\nTherefore, you should always have the option to humidify the air while you’re heating the room you’re in.\nIn this article, I’m going to show you 3 different space heaters that don’t dry the air. They come with built-in humidifiers to be able to heat and humidify at the same time.\nSo, let’s take a look.\nSpace Heaters that don’t dry the air - Recommendations Here are 3 space heaters that don’t dry the air. My recommendation is the first one (Dr Infrared Heater) because it is a powerful heater and a trusted brand.\nThe other two heaters are great choices again. Read through the reviews. They’ll help you decide!\nDr Infrared Heater Dual Heating System Link: Dr Infrared Heater Advanced Dual Heating System with Humidifier and Oscillation Fan (click here to check the price on amazon)\nMy recommendation.\nDr Infrared Heater is one of the most popular and reliable brands for space heaters.\nThey have lots of other top sellers that I know work great for heating even large rooms. If you want to humidify and heat a large room at the same time, this heater is perfect for you!\nYou can fill it with two glasses of ordinary tap water and it’ll heat and humidify for around 8.5 hours. After that, you’ll need to refill. I think that’s a great rate: 500ml per 8 hours of humidifying.\nIt’s not too much and not too little. Just enough to keep the humidity at a comfortable level.\nIf you want to heat only, you can simply turn off the humidification function. Heater and humidifier and independent of each other.\nThus, you have a solid heater model from a trusted brand and - if you want - you can always enable the humidifier. That’s exactly what we’re looking for. Perfect!\nBecause it’s an infrared heater, the Dr Infrared Heater is absolutely quiet and efficient. I have an infrared heater myself and it makes no noise at all.\nYou can even run it throughout the night:\n“Not only does this heater heat efficiently and QUIETLY - but the humidifier kept the room moist running all night long and I didn\u0026rsquo;t wake cold and stuffed. What a well-done product.” Betti - amazon reviewer\nWiland Space Heater with Built-In Humidifier Link: Wiland Space Heater with built-in humidifier (click here to check the price on amazon)\nBest Rated.\nThe Wiland space heater is able to produce heat within just 3 seconds (almost instantly). It comes with a built-in humidifier.\nWhat I like about it is that it comes with lots of safety certificates (CE, ROHS, FC, PSE).\nThis is especially important because when you’re heating your room with a space heater humidifier combo, you’re effectively combining water with electricity, which is always a safety issue.\nThe safety certifications prove that this heater is safe and you can run it without worries.\nAdditionally, the Wiland space heater is the type of heater that’s great for people who love features! You get a built-in timer, oscillation, power settings, and the built-in humidifier.\n“I have gone through plenty of space heaters in my life and this one is impressive. I’ve never had one with a humidifier and I love it! The moist heat is great. Winter warmth always comes with a price\u0026hellip;dry skin, but I think this is the answer.” Susan ML\nIt has two heat settings: A normal mode and a high mode. According to my experience with such heaters (I have a space heater with two power modes as well), that’s totally fine.\nTwo power settings are enough for most occasions.\nBecause it’s a ceramic heater that heats the air and distributes it using convection (with the built-in fan), the heat feels soft and comfortable. It might feel even better than the Dr Infrared Heater I recommended above, because infrared heaters don’t actually heat the air, but just objects (similar to what the sun does).\nIf you are curious, here’s an article on how infrared works.\nPortable Space Heater with Built-in Humidifier Link: Portable Space Heater with built-in humidifier (click here to check the price on amazon)\nBest for (very) small spaces and desktops.\nWhile both heaters I recommended above are suited for heating bigger areas like living rooms, this one is best for small spaces.\nFor example, it’s perfect for small bedrooms or student dorms.\nBecause this space heater is a rather small heater, it’s - of course - also cheaper than the others.\nIt uses only 1000W of power, which makes it less powerful than the other heaters. Personally, I have an 800W heater myself. Even though it’s not able to keep up the temperature of a big room, it gets burning hot in small areas.\nThat’s why I love to use these small types of heaters for keeping my feet warm. I just place them below my desk and point them at my feet - a feeling I can’t miss!\nIt also makes a great upper-body or handwarmer if you place it on your desktop.\nI don’t really know why, but NovoLido developed quite a hybrid product. It’s a space heater with a built-in humidifier. Okay, that’s what we’re looking for. But they’ve also added a built-in nightlight that shines in 7 different colors.\nSo, you can actually use it to fall asleep if you like nightlights.\nBecause it’s basically 3 products in 1, it also makes a great present for a friend. He’ll like at least one of the features.\nWhy nearly all space heaters dry the air Whenever you heat a room, the humidity seems to decrease and the air becomes dryer. But why is that?\nIt’s actually easy to explain. You don’t have to by a physicist to follow along.\nLet me explain. First let’s clarify, what relative humidity is:\n“Relative humidity is the amount of moisture in the air compared to what the air can \u0026ldquo;hold\u0026rdquo; at that temperature.” Department of Physics and Astronomy - Georgia State University\nAlright.\nWhen the temperature rises, the amount of moisture the air can hold rises as well. That means hot air can hold more air than cold air (that’s why you see condensation more often when it’s cold).\nAs the temperature increases, the amount of water in the air stays the same. But the air can now hold more air.\nTherefore, according to the definition above, the relative humidity decreases.\nThat, in turn, makes the air feel dryer, even though the amount of humidity in the air is the same as before heating.\nHot air is like a sponge that wicks away water from your skin.\nThat’s why everything that produces heat (every heater type: from wood stoves to infrared heaters) seems to dehumidify your room.\nIf you’re interested and need more details, read more about how space heaters dehumidify here.\nWhat else can you do to humidify a heated room? There are some easy things you can do to humidify a heated room.\nLet’s quickly take a look at 4 possibilities.\nPlace a bowl of water on the window sill - The temperature of your room will slowly evaporate the water in the bowl. Of course, this works best in a heated room. And it works even better if there’s a radiator below your window sill that heats the bowl. Leave the bathroom door open after showering - When you get out of the shower, you can see that mist starts accumulating on the bathroom mirror. Why don’t you just open the door and make the humidity enter your living room? This is a very effective way to humidify. However: You don’t shower all the time, and you can’t really control the amount of humidity. Regularly air your room - When you’re heating your room, the inside air might become even dryer than the outside air. If you keep your room vented while heating, it helps a little for humidification. Get a humidifier - Getting a humidifier is the most flexible and the best controllable method to humidify the dry air in your room. You can either get space heaters that don’t dry the air (like the ones I recommended with built-in humidifiers), or you can get a separate humidifier. A humidifier continuously evaporates water and keeps your room at a comfortable humidity. by: Bill Smith ( CC BY 2.0)\nCan I use a space heater along with a humidifier? What if you already have a space heater at home and you simply want to keep the air humid while heating: Can you use a space heater along with a humidifier?\nOf course, you can! It’s actually a good idea to have one specialized device for each job.\nFor heating, you have your space heater, and for humidifying, you have your humidifier.\nThat’s a good principle to follow in general. If one device breaks, the other will still work.\nIf you, for example, get the NovoLido space heater (from the above recommendations) with a built-in humidifier and a built-in nightlight, there’s quite a risk that if it breaks, nothing will work anymore.\nOn top of that, oftentimes devices that are dedicated to getting one job done, do this job better.\nSo, if you have some spare money, I’d actually recommend getting a heater and a humidifier separately.\nYou are also more flexible in doing so. You can, for example, place the space heater and the humidifier in different spots in your room.\nConclusion - Space Heaters that don’t dry the air If you want to keep the humidity in your room at a comfortable level, getting a space heater with a built-in humidifier is the way to go.\nThere are no space heaters that don’t dry the air unless they have such a built-in humidifier because heat always lowers the relative humidity. So, you need humidification, to increase humidity again.\nTo humidify a room without a humidifier, you can try setting up a bowl of water on your window sill or leaving the door open after showering. For sure, these methods will help with dry air produced by your space heater.\nAttributions: title image by Aaron Yoo ( CC BY-ND 2.0)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/space-heaters-that-dont-dry-the-air/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHere are 3 space heaters that don’t dry the air!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever you heat your room with a space heater, the air gets dryer and dryer.

Being cold keeps the mood down and your guests might even remember your event as an ice-disaster.\nOnce, I’ve had a party that was simply too cold. I just didn’t plan the weather in and thought, the party tent would keep the cold out. That was not the case:\nEven though I brought the guests blankets and tea to keep warm, they were leaving after just 2 hours.\nBack then I wondered what happened, but now it’s obvious that I just didn’t prepare well enough.\nTo avoid this happening at your wedding - one of the most important days of your life - follow this guide, learn from my mistakes, and be prepared.\nAfter reading this, you’ll know everything about heating a wedding tent when it’s cold outside.\nHeating a Wedding Tent: Start with the right mindset The first thing you need for heating a wedding tent is not a heater, a fireplace or insulation:\nThe very first thing to start with is setting up the right mindset for heating your tent.\nHere’s what you have to consider while planning your wedding:\nPrepare for the worst that can happen - As soon as something happens that’s not planned (e.g. rain), your wedding party will be in danger. If you keep the worst in mind while planning your wedding, you’ll always know what to do when it happens and you’ll feel more confident about your wedding. Have full responsibility for everything that happens - “Does it start raining? Oh no! What bad luck!” - While this sentence might be okay on a short afternoon’s city walk, it’s a no-no at your wedding. There won’t be any “bad luck” at your wedding because you’re going to have full responsibility for everything that happens and you’re going to keep it warm \u0026amp; cozy for your guests. If you’re okay with following these rules and you’ve accepted being the ultimate party planner, let’s continue with the actual heating-guide.\nI’ll show you everything you can do to ensure your wedding tent is warm - even in the middle of winter.\nElectric or Propane Heaters for a wedding tent? First off, never plan to use a wedding tent without heaters. I was completely wrong when I assumed that my tent would stay warm enough from the guests’ body temperature.\nThat was wrong! And the event turned out to be a failure.\nSo, let’s just postulate:\n“You need a heater for every event you plan that is not in mid-summer.”\nBut what kind of heater is best for heating a wedding tent? Let’s take a look.\nAre electric heaters suited for heating a wedding tent? Electric space heaters need, as the name suggests, electricity. That could be a hassle at your wedding.\nOftentimes, it’s difficult to run a cord across the whole place to find the next outlet. On top of that, using extension cords with space heaters increases the chance of a fire accident.\nAlternatively, you could generate electricity yourself. And it’s true:\nYou can run a space heater off a generator. That would work just fine.\nBut here are a few points that would make me think twice about using a generator and a space heater for heating a wedding tent:\nIt will be loud - Generators have built-in motors that produce the electricity. They’ll produce significant noise. The generator will run on diesel and might smell. You would need to rent or buy a generator and a heater - Personally, I believe that we should be effective when planning: One device for one purpose. But for heating a wedding tent with an electric space heater, we’d need to get both a generator and an electric heater. You need two devices for heating. Generators are very expensive - If you don’t own a generator already, getting a new one is pretty expensive. They range from 200$ well into the thousands depending on what power you need. Let’s take a look at what I think is the much better choice for heating a wedding tent:\nPropane heaters are the best choice In contrast to electric heaters that need to be powered using a generator, propane heaters are portable and do not depend on electricity.\nAs long as you have a propane tank hooked up, you can place it anywhere you want. Propane heaters are very flexible.\nPropane heaters come in all sizes and shapes and provide any level of heating power you need, whereas electric heaters are very limited because the electric cord can only carry a certain amount of power.\nAlso, propane heaters are\nQuiet- Heating with propane doesn’t produce any noise. Durable- Because propane heaters don’t depend on moving parts (a motor or a built-in fan) and they don’t contain sensitive electronics, propane heaters are very durable and can last you a lifetime (at home, I still have my grandpa’s propane heater from the 80s). How big should the heater be for heating a wedding tent? Because propane heaters don’t use any electricity, you can’t directly measure their power in watts.\nPropane heating power is measured in BTU, which stands for “British thermal units”.\nWhen you buy a new propane heater, there’s always a BTU value in the product description that tells you how much heating power it has.\n“Before you purchase a new space heater, size it to make sure it will have enough British thermal units (BTUs) to heat the room where it will be used.”\nSpace heater sizing guide\nLet’s calculate how many BTUs a space heater for a wedding tent needs.\nFor the calculation, I’ll assume that a standard-sized wedding tent is about 40 by 60 feet (2400 square feet). If your tent is bigger or smaller, you can adapt the end result as you wish.\nGenerally, one square foot of space needs about 10 watts of heating power - that’s the equivalent of 34.1 BTU.\nTherefore, a 2400 square feet wedding tent would need about 82,000 BTU of heating power.\nHowever, this calculation is only valid for closed rooms.\nA wedding tent is not perfectly insulated and has thin walls: It loses heat.\nTo make up for the increased heat loss you should increase the heating power by another 50% and get 123,000 BTU of heating power.\nThe best way to get to this value is to get three patio propane heaters of about 46,000 BTU each.\nWhich propane heater is best for heating a wedding tent? To reach the high amount of heating power you need for your wedding tent, you should get powerful heaters.\nI’ve found that the most powerful heaters are so called-torpedo heaters. However, they blast open flames and can be a hazard for your wedding.\nThat’s why you should stick to safer - and better looking - heaters.\nI recommend using patio heaters. Most of them provide around 40,000 - 50,000 BTU by getting two or three of them, you can keep your tent warm safely.\nHere’s my recommendation.\nBudget patio heater (if you want to save some money)\nNother 48,000 BTU Propane Patio Heater w/Wheels(click to check the price on amazon) Slightly higher priced heater (for the most reliable heating experience at your wedding)\nHampton Bay 48000 Btu Stainless Steel Patio Heater (click to check the price on amazon) The best thing about these heaters is that both have a built-in table, so your guests can sip their drinks and chat there.\nBoth of them are still comparably cheap compared to industry-standard models which cost well above 1,000$, but they will get the job done.\nHow much propane do you need? Generally, the bigger your wedding tent is, the more propane you’ll need. I’ve found estimations online, but in my opinion, they are way too small.\nRemember the being-prepared-for-everything-mindset we talked about in the beginning.\nFor your wedding, you should get at least 60-80lb of propane tanks per propane heater.\nIf it turns out to be more than you needed after the wedding, you can simply return it to the seller or keep it for later use.\nYou don’t lose any money by getting more than you need, but you get security and confidence that your wedding will be a success.\nShould you buy or rent a heater for heating a wedding tent? I’ve found that for wedding tents, there are tons of rental companies. And of course, they also want to supply you with the heaters you need.\nHowever, I don’t think that renting heaters from your wedding tent-supplier is necessary.\nInstead, I’d buy a heater, because - trust me - you’ll throw more events than just that one wedding.\nImagine having to rent heaters each and every time you need one in your life. Why don’t you just get the right heater upfront and never worry about renting again?\nOwning a big propane heater will be cheaper in the long run than constantly renting one.\nThat’s why I suggest buying heaters.\nImprove heat flow in your wedding tent by using a fan One thing I like to recommend for heating a cold wedding tent is placing a fan in some corner.\nIt will help to distribute the heat and helps to keep the guests warm that don’t stand directly below the patio heaters.\nWhen do you need tent walls for a wedding tent? Now that we clarified everything about heating and distributing the heat, there’s still one issue we need to solve:\nInsulation.\nWhen is it necessary to get tent walls for a wedding tent? Here’s my answer:\nAlways! Always have tent walls for your wedding tent. Nights nearly always get cold enough to make guests uncomfortable.\nEven if you have three patio heaters that can keep some guests warm, the heat will quickly disappear and get carried away with the wind.\nTent walls are the most important part of your tent. They block off side winds. Without side tent walls, your wedding can become chilly and some guests might even get sick the next day.\nCamelot Party Rentals\nDo you need a floor to keep the tent warm? Tent floors help with insulation. Especially when your wedding takes place in spring or autumn, tent walls are worth considering. During the wintertime, tent walls are a must!\nAn additional dancefloor can also help to keep the guests moving (which in turn keeps them warm).\nDuring the summertime, a tent floor is not necessary.\nAddon tips for having a memorable wedding tent party Now that we have covered the most important parts about heating a wedding tent, here are some additional tips:\nIn the wintertime, bring snow shovels with you. I’ve heard of winter-weddings that took place in a wedding tent. It snowed the night before, so there was no snow-free path to the wedding tent entry. Every guest got his feet wet. Don’t switch on and off the heaters all night. Also, prevent guests from doing so. Turning on and off the heat will cause uncomfortable fluctuations in temperature: It’ll get hot and people start sweating, followed by freezing. Prepare some hand warmers or hot water bottles. Some guests, especially the older generation, need more heat than others. If you notice, that someone’s cold, you can hand him a handwarmer or a hot water bottle and he’ll positively remember your wedding as the best-prepared wedding they’ve been to. Conclusion First off, having the right mindset is crucial. Have control over the situation and prepare for the worst: In summer, prepare for summer rain. In spring, prepare for a cold night that still feels like it’s winter.\nWith propane patio heaters, you have a good source of heat and tent walls will keep the heat. Also, you can add additional insulation (like blankets) to fill the air gaps in your tent walls.\n“The most important thing to keep in mind: Try to have some fun! This is your wedding after all. Don’t get too hung up on the tiny details and focus on what’s truly important.”\nbrides.com\nI hope that this guide helped you get some insights into how you can effectively heat your wedding tent.\nI wish you a successful wedding!\nAttributions: title image by shane_jaime_523,\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/heating-a-wedding-tent-the-ultimate-guide/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHeating a wedding tent is one of the things you should never forget while planning your wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving shivering guests is one of the worst things that can happen to you.

I just had to answer this question, when I noticed that my space heater cord isn’t long enough to place my heater anywhere I wanted.\nTo find the space heater with the longest cords, I’ve researched for hours, browsing through product descriptions and manuals to find the lengths of the cords of dozens of space heaters.\nAnd it was pretty difficult to get the values. It seems like companies try to hide the cord length on purpose. But why?\nWhat I found was surprising. Keep reading to find out!\nWhen do you need a space heater with a long cord? Long cords are especially useful when you want to be flexible with your space heater.\nFor example, when you want to place your space heater in a distant corner of your room, where there’s no wall outlet.\nAlso, it’s always annoying to constantly plug your space heater in and out of outlets just to move it a little.\nWhen I want to move my space heater from my desk area to my bed area, I have to unplug it and plug it in somewhere else, even though it’s just a few feet away.\nThat gets annoying, so it makes sense to look for space heaters with long cords from the beginning.\nHere are 5 space heaters with the longest cords I could find online.\nSpace Heaters with long cords: Our 5 Top Picks After researching the length of dozens of space heaters and writing every single data point down in an excel sheet, I’ve found that bigger space heaters generally have longer cords than smaller space heaters.\nTo get a space heater with a long cord, you should, therefore, stick to space heaters of a bigger size.\nI’ve also found that within the range of big space heaters there’s no difference in cord lengths at all. All of them are about 6 feet in length and that’s it. You never get more.\nBut don’t worry, later on I’ll show you how to extend the length of your cord. Keep reading.\nHere are our 5 top picks:\nOur winner with the longest cord (6.5 feet):\nHoneywell HCE323V Digital Ceramic Heater (click here to check price on amazon) - The Honeywell tower heater is a really cool heater that has a feature I’ve never heard of: A motion sensor that automatically shuts off when an object gets too close. This way it is a very safe heater if you have kids or pets around.\nAnd it is our number one candidate for being the space heater with the longest cord. It comes with a 6.5 feet cord, which is the longest I could find. However, that’s only half an inch longer than the other four heaters below. The next 4 heaters all have cords of 6ft. length\nLasko 5586 Digital Ceramic Tower Heater with Remote (click here to check the price on amazon) - A tower heater with an adjustable thermostat and everything you need.

What to do if a 6 feet space heater cord is not enough? If you want to increase your flexibility with space heaters and a 6 feet. cord is not long enough, I’d recommend getting this heavy-duty extension cord (amazon link).\nI’ve already written an article about space heaters and extension cords and explained why it might be unsafe. But I talked only about thin, cheap extension cords.\nThis heavy-duty power cord is definitely suited for most 1500W space heaters.\nAnd because it’s 12ft. long you can place your space heater anywhere you want\nYou can safely use this extension cord as long as the amperage rating of your space heater is below the 15A rating of the extension cord.\nMost heaters are perfectly fine to run on this extension cord. However, be careful with heaters that need more than 1500W.\nI found a reviewer who reliably powered a 1800W heater using the cable without issues.\n\u0026ldquo;I used it all winter long with an 1800W heater that rarely turned off. This cord was always cool to the touch.”\nJillie - amazon reviewer\nWhat’s the average length of a space heater cord? Because I already collected all the data for space heater cords, it’s easy to find the median average value:\nIf you list all space heater cord lengths you can find, what’s the average length of a space heater cord?\nAnswer: The median length of a space heater cord is 6 feet (about 1.8 meters).\nThis value is dominated by the big amount of big space heaters in my dataset.\nSmaller space heaters usually have cords of about 4-5 feet.\nBigger space heaters have longer cords Within my collected data, I clearly found a connection between big space heaters and long cords and small space heaters and small cords.\nBut that’s kind of obvious:\nSmall space heaters are often used in desk areas and don’t need to be placed freely.\nBig space heaters are meant to heat entire rooms and therefore need longer cords to be placed in a safe spot. The bigger your space heater is, the more inflexible you are with placements (because you can’t place a big space heater everywhere you want) and thus the manufacturer increases the cable length.\nIf you plan to get a space heater and can’t find a listed cord value, you can safely assume that a small space heater has a cord of 4ft. length and a big heater has a cord of 6 ft. length.\nWhen I reviewed the space heater cord-length dataset, I couldn’t find any correlation between cord length and price of the space heater.\nIf you get an expensive space heater, don’t assume it has a longer cord.\nHow to find the cord length of a space heater? Finding the cord length of a space heater you plan to buy is pretty hard. When I did my research for this article, I found that no sales page ever lists it.\nYou always have to put in efforts to look up the cord length somewhere.\nBut why is that?\nHere’s my guess:\nKnowing a cord length puts additional stress on a potential customer and might impact the buying decision. That’s why companies avoid listing cord lengths.\nAs soon as a potential customer knows the cord length, he will try to figure out whether the space heater fits in his space. Knowing the cord length increases the resistance to buy.\nFor finding the cord lengths of a space heater, I found that the best way (at least on amazon) is to check the Q\u0026amp;A sections.\nYou’re not the only one looking for space heaters with long cords.\nAnd that’s why other people often (but not always) have asked that question already. Usually, the amazon customer service or someone else already responded and you can see the cord length.\nThat’s how I found all my values. Companies never listed them on their sales page.\nAre there any space heaters with extra long cords? Answer: No there are no space heaters with extra long cords. When I collected the data of dozens of space heaters, there were no outstanding cord lengths.\nThe longest one I found was a space heater with 6.5 inches, but that’s about it.\nI’m sure that companies found that 6ft. is the optimum length to produce their cords. It’s short enough to be cheap to produce, but just long enough to avoid getting bad reviews online.\nUsually, a 6 feet cord is just what you need.\nAre there any space heaters without cords? After reading all of this, you might be frustrated. All you were looking for was a space heater that you can carry anywhere in your house without constantly plugging and unplugging it.\nBut wait:\nWe only looked at electric space heaters that depend on cords.\nBut of course, there are space heaters without cords. My favorite ones are propane heaters.\nThey are indoor-safe heaters that you can safely run in your house. All you have to do is hook it up to a propane tank.\nThey are very durable, flexible and energy-efficient.\nWhat I like most about them is that you can even use them outdoors. Check this article on how to keep warm in an uninsulated garage.\nEach time you want to be flexible with a space heater, you should get a propane heater instead of a standard electric heater.\nYou can even take them with you for camping!\nConclusion - Space Heaters with long cords Nearly all space heaters have a cord length of 6 feet. It seems like that’s what most people want and what fulfills most needs.\nIf you want to be more flexible with your space heater, you can get a high-power extension cord that is suited for high amperage devices.\nBut make sure you plug-in your extension cord firmly:\n“The looser the connection the more heat is created with the connection. The longer this goes on the insulation will melt and the metal used will do the same.”\nKneedragger - member at anandtech.com\nHowever, if you want to avoid thinking about power, electricity, and safety and you just want to get a heater that you can take anywhere, an indoor propane heater is probably the best choice for you.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/5-space-heaters-with-long-cords-ranked-reviewed/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre there any space heaters with long cords?

Pelonis Oil-filled Radiator with built-in thermostat (click here to view it on amazon) - If you’ve spent some time on this website before, you’ve probably noticed that I recommend the Pelonis oil heater in about every space heater safety article.\nWhy?\nBecause it has so many safety features, like tip-over protection, overheat protection, built-in timer, thermostat, remote control and everything that you wish for in a space heater.\nAnd on top of that, it is ETL safety certified!\nThe Pelonis space heater will never blow a fuse. Lasko Tower Heater (click here to check the price on amazon)\nThis indoor space heater is a great choice for you, because it has several power modes:\nYou can decide for 1500W, 1000W and ECO mode. As long as you use the 1000W setting or the ECO mode, your fuse will stay 100% safe. Pelonis Tower Heater (click here to check the price on amazon) - Even though this tower heater runs on 1500W, it has a built-in ECO mode that you can use if you want to stay safe and keep your fuse intact.\nIt also has overheat protection. Why do space heaters blow fuses? Quick Answer: Space heaters blow fuses because of their high power consumption. When you plug them in an electric circuit like an outlet, and the circuit doesn’t have enough reserve capacity to power the heater, a fuse blows to protect other devices from damage.\nLonger answer:\nSpace heaters need a lot of power. Most of them need about 1500W to be exact.\nWhen you plug in a space heater together with some other devices, they will exceed the amount of power your circuit can deliver.\nBecause of that, the fuse will overload and break. Or a safety switch will get triggered.\nBut that’s a good thing.\nA fuse blows because if it didn’t, an accident would happen.\nFuses protect your house from electric accidents like overheating cords or power fluctuations that would damage electric devices in your home.\nYour house power supply consists of several circuits. And each of these electric circuits can deliver only a certain (limited) amount of power.\nIf you surpass the threshold of power your circuit can deliver, a fuse will blow to protect other devices in the circuit.\nYou could, for example, surpass the power threshold by plugging in a space heater together with other devices in a power strip (don’t do it).\nThe connected devices will draw so much power that big currents will flow through the cords and potentially damage something.\nThat’s where a fuse comes into play.\nLet me explain how fuses work.\nWhat is a fuse and how does it work? “A fuse or a circuit breaker automatically disconnects a circuit from the electric power the moment more current is drawn than its design allows.”\nNASA archive: Fuses and Electric Shock\nA fuse is very simple:\nIt’s nothing more than a thin metal strand.\nThe whole current of a circuit flows through it. When the current increases, the strand heats up.\nAnd because a fuse is so incredibly thin, it is very sensitive to heat, meaning that it will melt very fast.\nBut why does it get hot in the first place? Current consists of a huge amount of electrons, small loaded particles, that move slowly through an electric circuit. The higher a current is, the more electrons will flow through the wires.\nWires consist of metal atoms that conduct the electricity. Between these metal atoms, there’s lots of empty space.\nNow let’s have a small thought experiment:\nWhat would happen if we had an incredibly low current of just one electron?\nAnswer: The electron would move through the wire without bumping into any metal atoms - it moves freely.\nHowever, what happens if the current increases and we have a crowd of electrons moving through the wire?\nThen, lots of electrons would crash into the metal atoms and shake them.\nThe metal atoms will start to vibrate: They heat up.\nNow, the fuse is that thin metal wire.\nWhen too high current flows through it, it will overload, heat up quickly and blow.\n“In short, a fuse is nothing more than a controlled failure.”\nSteeven - an engineer and author\nWhenever a fuse blows don’t be angry about it. Rather be thankful for it. The protected your home from serious damage.\nHow do you know the 5 space heaters don’t blow fuses? The space heaters I picked and recommended in the first section of this post are sure-fire heaters that will not blow any fuses.\nOf course, that also depends on your usage, but they are comparably safe (Later on, I’ll show you how to use space heaters to avoid blowing fuses).\nActually, there’s just one single reason that guarantees that a space heater won’t blow a fuse:\nSpace heaters that run on low wattage are less likely to overload an electric circuit. Thus they are way safer than high power space heaters.\nFuses often blow when several high power devices are plugged in the same circuit.\nIf you have a desktop pc and space heater plugged in at the same time it could be enough to blow the fuse. By reducing the power of a space heater from 1500W to 1000W you effectively increase the buffer and make overloading less likely.\nTherefore the above-recommended space heaters don’t blow fuses - they consume less power and keep a circuit safe\ngenerally, all space heaters are safe - but they blow fuses mostly when you combine them with other electrical devices.\nA high power space heater might be fine, but as soon as you turn a lightbulb on, the fuse will blow.\n3 Space heater tips to avoid blowing fuses (from an electrical engineer) Here are 3 space heater tips to avoid blowing fuses:\nUnplug other devices that you don’t need while you run a space heater. Don’t use an extension cord. Extension cords (especially the cheap ones) can catch fire and decrease the efficiency of your space heater. They can also increase the amount of power your space heater pulls from the circuit. Click here for the full guide on why you shouldn’t use an extension cord with a space heater. Run the heater on low power settings. Most heaters have an option to switch between 1500W, 1000W and 750W. Make use of it and decrease the wattage whenever you don’t really need all the heating-power. If you keep these 3 rules in mind and follow them whenever you use a space heater, I’m 100% sure, you will never have a blown fuse again.\nDoes more wattage mean more heat? Yes, according to the laws of physics, you can only get more heat with higher wattage.\nIn fact, you are sacrificing heat for safety when it comes to reducing the amount of power a space heater consumes.\nLess power means increased safety, but for the cost of less heat.\nI’m constantly running an 800W infrared heater in my room and I must say that it is definitely enough for my bedroom, but not enough to heat an entire living room.\nTherefore, if you want to have a heater that is powerful and can replace a radiator, you can only make sure your fuse stays safe by making sure you don’t use other high wattage devices together with your space heater.\nConclusion - Space Heaters that don’t blow fuses Space heaters that don’t blow fuses are always heaters that consume less power to run.\nEfficient heaters drain less current and therefore make sure that your fuse stays intact.\nIf you get one of the above-mentioned space heaters, you can be absolutely sure your fuses will stay safe as long as you additionally follow the 3 tips.\nI hope, this article could point you in the right direction for choosing your heater!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/space-heaters-that-dont-blow-fuses-our-5-top-picks/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSpace heaters that don’t blow fuses: Is that even possible?

And they are energy efficient and won’t raise your electric bill too high.\nIn this article, I’m going to show you three different oil-filled heaters you can leave on all night without any worries.\nBecause you might be insecure about running a space heater overnight, I’ll also show you why oil-filled radiators are safe to run all night and what you can do to increase safety even more.\nLet’s take a look!\n3 Best Oil Heaters you can leave on all night - My picks First off, here are the 3 best oil heaters you can safely leave on all night:\nPelonis 2019 Oil Filled Radiator (click here to check the price on amazon) - The Pelonis oil-filled heater is one of my all-time-favorite heaters. It comes with an incredible amount of features like a built-in timer, a remote control, a thermostat (and much more). Compared to other heater brands, Pelonis is the most affordable! I don’t know where else you can get such a heater for that price.\nAdditionally, the Pelonis heater is ETL certified which makes it a safe choice for running overnight.\nDe\u0026rsquo;Longhi Comfort Oil-Filled Radiator Space Heater (click here to check the price on amazon) - This heater is a good choice for bigger rooms because it can produce so much heat safely. So, if your bedroom is big and you want to keep cozy \u0026amp; warm, this DeLonghi heater is your choice. Just like the other heater, it comes with all the safety features like tip-over protection, a timer, and overheat protection.\nBEST CHOICE: DeLonghi TRD40615E Oil-Filled Radiator Space Heater (click here to check the price on amazon) - Okay, as you can tell, I’m a fan of this brand. They produce solid and high-quality heaters for low prices and get tons of good reviews. This model is a little higher priced than the previous model, because the heating times are programmable. I would trust this heater to keep big living rooms warm. It also has an even better rating than the previous heaters.\nThe steel cover protects it from damage when it tips over and adds a lot to the overall design. A good choice if you don’t want to have an ugly heater in your bedroom.\nSafety features that keep oil heater safe overnight Somewhere I once saw a question posted online:\n“Why are all space heaters so ugly?”\nIt made me laugh! I never thought about that. So, if you want to pick a good looking heater, that you can leave in your bedroom without worrying that someone says it’s ugly, I’d suggest the last heater from the list.\nAnyways, this article is not about beauty, but about safety and leaving oil heaters on all night.\nAll of the oil heaters I selected have the following safety features:\nOverheat protection Tip-over protection Thermostat A timer to automatically shut off The Pelonis oil heaters are even ETL certified (That’s a solid safety certification - not all heaters have it)!\nOil-filled heaters are the safest type of heaters By choosing one of the above oil heaters, you can be sure to have a safe way to heat throughout the night.\nBut why are oil-filled heaters the safest types of heaters?\nFirst, the heating element of an oil-heater is encased in a metal body and encased in oil.\nThe metal body and the oil, therefore cover the heating element and make it impossible to touch it.\nMost space heater accidents are caused by space heaters with exposed heating elements that get hot enough to burn things.\nBecause oil-filled space heaters distribute the heat over a big surface, everything stays safe to touch.\nAdditionally, oil-filled heaters don’t use any burning fuels like propane or diesel to produce the heat. Instead, they rely on plain electricity that in turn heats a heating element which in turn heats the oil inside the heater (I hope this didn’t confuse you).\nThe oil in oil heaters is very safe for heating The oil in oil heaters does two things:\nIt stores heat - Meaning that it heats up slowly and cools down slowly as well. Oil heaters are rather slow heaters because the heating element first needs to heat the oil. It keeps internal pressure stable - Engineers decided to use oil in heaters because it has a high boiling point. The oil stays liquid while it’s heating and doesn’t really increase the pressure on the metal case.\nIf you replaced the oil with water, for example, your heater would be a lot more likely to explode because water evaporates and builds pressure. The combination of metal and oil that can handle high temperatures is a very secure combination.\n“So when I say that oil has a higher boiling point than water, what I am actually saying is that the chemical bonds that hold oil together are stronger than the ones holding water together - it takes more heat to break them apart.”\nDepartment of Physics - University of Illinois\nNearly all modern oil-filled heaters (like the ones I recommended above) have a vast amount of security features. You get everything you need to leave them on all night.\nFor example, oil-filled heaters have built-in tip-over protection that shuts them off automatically as soon as someone tips them over (can happen in the dark at night).\nI’ve also written an article about heaters you can leave unattended. My favorites were by far the oil-filled heaters.\nEven though oil heaters are very safe to leave on all night, here are some additional safety measures you can take.\nWhat to make sure before leaving an oil-heater on all night? You don’t feel comfortable leaving your oil-heater on overnight? Don’t worry, I know how you feel.\nBecause I was in the same situation with my heaters, I took some safety measures to make sure that no accidents happen and that I can sleep calmly.\nFirst, don’t have any flammable objects nearby - Avoid having clothes next to the oil heater (even worse: don’t dry clothes on your oil-heater overnight - it might work, but for the night, let’s avoid even the slightest risk). This includes all kinds of fabrics. Also, avoid having your fluffy slippers next to the heater.\nBecause heater accidents always happen when the heater is drawing too much power from your outlet (and thus the cord overheats and catches fire), consider using low power settings throughout the night. Even on low power settings, oil heaters get hot enough anyway.\nThe less power you use and the smaller the temperature you set, the safer your cord will be.\nWhen you sleep, you don’t need to heat all night. Mostly it’s enough to fall asleep while it’s warm. Therefore, consider setting a timer that automatically switches off your oil-heater in the middle of the night.\nTo do so, you can either use an electrical timer switch or use a space heater with a built-in timer (all of the oil heaters I recommended above have built-in timers).\nDon’t worry!\nIt will not get too cold during the night, because oil heaters retain their heat.\nCan you leave an oil heater on overnight? Answer: Yes, you can leave an oil heater on overnight. Oil heaters are designed to be very safe. In contrast to other types of heaters, they don’t expose any heating elements, their big metal surface doesn’t get too hot to the touch, and oil heaters have lots of additional security features like built-in timers, tip-over protection, etc.\nOil heaters are a lot less likely to cause you any trouble when you leave them on overnight.\nThe internal pressure of the oil stays constant because the oil has a high boiling point. Therefore oil heaters can handle high temperatures for long times.\nAlso, there are no moving parts that cause noise and sleep interruption. And the hot body doesn’t get glowing red like infrared heaters.\nThat’s why oil heaters are the best heaters for sleeping.\nOther ways to keep warm at night “If your bedroom gets too cold in the later part of the night, consider investing in a hot water bottle or two to put under the covers 20-30 minutes before you climb in.”\nverlo.com - Sleeping with Space Heaters\nWith a hot water bottle, you can easily avoid the need for a space heater running all night.\nYou can preheat your basement with a heater and then turn it off when you go to sleep.\nTo stay warm, simply use a hot water bottle.\nWhile this works great as long as you’re alone in the room, a water bottle wouldn’t work for 2 or more persons.\nConclusion - Best Oil Heaters you can Leave on All Night Personally, I’d use the Pelonis oil heater (click here for amazon link) to heat my room overnight.\nWhy?\nBecause it gives you the most bang for your buck.\nYou get everything you need - from all kinds of protection features up to a safety certificate and high user ratings - for a lower price than the DeLonghi brand models.\nIf I was you I’d pick the DeLonghi models if you want a nicer and more luxurious design, or if you want to heat a bigger room.\nBut don’t worry. All of the heaters do a perfect job of heating a room all night.\nAttributions: takuhitofujita (title image)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/3-best-oil-heaters-you-can-leave-on-all-night/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOil heaters are exactly the type of heater you need to leave on all night and heat your basement safely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, nights are freezing cold and you absolutely need to stay warm at night in order to get a good night of sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor heating a bedroom, oil-heaters are really practical: Compared to other space heaters, they are very safe.

By heating a boat, you not only feel more comfortable, but you also benefit some technical aspects of the boat: Heat protects the water and sewage system and the engine compartment from freezing.\nPeople even say that you need to have a heater on board when you’re boating the Carribean sea. Weather is not always in your favor.\nThe best type of heater for a boat cabin First, let’s check which requirements out perfect boat cabin heater needs.\nIf your boat is on a trailer during the wintertime, you might need to protect it from freezing: Some heaters have antifreeze protection which keeps the temperature just above the freezing point.\nThe antifreeze protection turns on the heater automatically when the temperature drops too low. Though, I think antifreeze is not mandatory, because most boats get away without any antifreeze measures.\nA boat heater should always have tip-over protection, which means that it automatically turns off the heat when it falls over (which can happen on a boat).\nAlso, we’ll look out for heaters that don’t require electricity (I’ll explain why later on). The better choice is a gas heater because you can’t spill any fuel with it.\nPreferably, your new boat cabin heater should be small and portable.\nI prefer models that you can easily get everywhere. That’s why we’ll look out for normal types of heaters instead of specially designed boat heaters.\nBasically, they’re the exact same product, but the boat heater companies have less competition, so they set higher prices while having a lower quality.\nThat’s why a normal type of heater is the better choice.\nElectric Heaters or Gas Heaters in a boat cabin? Should you rather use an electric space heater or a gas heater to heat a boat cabin?\nBoth of them have valid reasons for usage. Let’s take a look.\nElectric space heaters are the better choice if you want to have lots of settings. They often have built-in timers, a thermostat and maybe even a built-in fan.\nHowever, electric space heaters drain lots of energy from your boat’s power supply. When you also run a small fridge (or a similar device) in your boat cabin, you can easily overload the power supply and blow a fuse.\nYou could bypass using the power system of your boat by getting a generator. You can check out this article to find out which generator you can use to power a space heater.\nHowever, if you don’t have a generator at hand already, it could be troublesome to install an electric space heater and a generator on your boat.\nYou could simply use another type of heater:\nGas heaters are efficient and don’t require any electricity.\n“many owners, particularly those with smaller boats, speak highly of these types of [propane] cabin heaters.”\nsailboat-cruising.com\nIn my opinion, gas is by far the easiest heating method for heating boat cabins.\nAll you need is a small gas tank and you’re set to start heating.\nWhich heater is the best for heating a boat? The best heater to heat a boat cabin is also my favorite overall propane heater:\nMr. Heater F274830 MH18BRV Big Buddy Grey Indoor-Safe Portable RV Propane Heater (click here to check the price on amazon) Generally, I recommend this model (the Big Buddy instead of the Little Buddy) because you get the same heat and efficiency on the lower settings, but you can also set the heat on “high” in case it gets uncomfortably cold on your boat.\nThe Little Buddy heater raises the temperature on your boat by about 10 degrees. Meanwhile, you can reach a temperature raise of 20 or more degrees with the Big Buddy.\nTo hook a 20lb propane tank to the heater, you’ll need this big buddy hose (amazon link). Without the hose, you can connect it to two 1lb propane cylinders.\nA 20lb propane tank will last you about 24 hours on full heat and 65 hours on low heat. That’s up to one month’s supply if you heat your boat cabin on high heat in the evening hours only.\nCarolyn Shearlock from theboatgallery.com said this about her Mr. Heater Little Buddy:\n\u0026ldquo;No, it doesn’t turn the boat into a sauna . . . but it makes it comfortable to sit and read. And if I’m warm when I go to bed – and the sheets aren’t freezing – my body heat warms up the bed and I’m comfortable to fall asleep.\u0026rdquo;\nCarolyn Shearlock - theboatgallery\nThe best thing about it is that you can get the propane tanks anywhere - even at Walmart.\nYou can get 30lb tanks for 40 dollars already - meaning that one hour of full power heating costs you 90 cents and one hour of lower power heating costs you about 41 cents\nThings to remember while heating a boat cabin Propane heaters are generally safe. A lot safer than electric heaters which could heat up your boat’s power supply.\nBut there are a few things to remember while heating a boat cabin with your propane heater.\nAir regularly - Propane heaters (even though they are declared indoor safe) could increase the carbon monoxide levels in your boat cabin. So, make sure that you keep your cabin vented.\nAlso, heaters reduce the relative humidity in the air, which could leave you with a sore throat the next morning. So, just make sure you air your cabin regularly and get some humidity into your cabin.\n3 Lessons from a boat heater accident Here are 3 lessons learned from a boat fire that was caused by an electric space heater.\nThe couple that was on the boat that day didn’t get injured. Here’s what they said is important for keeping your boat safe:\nAlways have a fire extinguisher nearby - A fire extinguisher is a lifesaver. No explanation required.\nInstall smoke detectors - Smoke detectors alarm you in time. They are especially important if you have multiple compartments on your boat.\n“Just like houses and apartments, boats need to have smoke detectors. [\u0026hellip;] It’s a good idea to have one in the engine compartment(s) as well as in living areas”\nHeater placements - Place your heater in a safe spot on your boat and notice whether there are ignitable carpets nearby. Always think twice about running a space heater throughout the night. I’d even suggest avoiding running it overnight and spending some money on boat insulation (to retain heat longer).\nCan you leave the boat heater on while you sleep? Yes, you can leave the boat heater on while you sleep, but you should carefully make sure nothing can go wrong.\nIf you already know you want to leave your space heater on throughout the night, an electric space heater on low settings might be an even better choice than a propane heater, because electric heaters often have timer settings so they automatically turn off after some time.\nBut generally speaking, a gas heater on low heat is safe as well.\nMost heaters you buy today are safe. Oftentimes they have overheat protection, a thermostat and tip-over protection (which is especially important on boats).\nConclusion To heat a boat cabin, I recommend sticking to common propane heaters. They are versatile and you can also use them elsewhere: For example, if you don’t use your boat for a period of time, you can just grab your heater, and use it to heat your garage .\nYou can use them anywhere.\nI believe it’s also important to insulate your boat’s cabin as much as you can. Insulation keeps the cold air out and makes sure that you don’t waste valuable energy on your boat.\nHeating a boat cabin with air gaps will cost you a lot more in the long run than heating a boat with insulation.\nI hope I could point you in the right direction with this article.

What’s the best way to do it? Is it possible to heat effectively? And if yes, how?\nGenerally speaking, garages can get uncomfortably cold in the wintertime. Especially when your garage is without insulation.\nEntering a cold garage is and having no option to heat it effectively is like jumping into cold water - it’s just uncomfortable and everyone hates it.\nEspecially if you have a garage woodworking shop (or similar), it adds a lot of enjoyment if you can heat your space whenever you like.\nWithout insulation, you’d rather avoid your garage in the wintertime.\nI’m an electrical engineer and I’ve spent countless hours in the freezing cold woodworking shop at my parent’s house.\nHere’s are 5 effective ways to heat a garage without insulation.\nHow to heat a garage without insulation First, there’s no free lunch: You either have to spend money on insulation or pay for heat. Later, I’ll show you a simple strategy to not waste money on heating in the long run.\n1. Overhead tube heater An effective way to heat a garage without insulation is to install an overhead infrared tube heater.\nBecause they work with infrared radiation, these big heaters don’t heat the air, they heat objects.\nIntuitively, that makes a lot of sense: A garage without insulation oftentimes has air gaps (below doors, under the roof).\nHeating not the air, but objects makes sure that the heat you perceive is not affected by air exchange.\nWhat I like about them is that if you open a door, most of the heat will not disappear instantly, because it is not stored in the air, but in objects.\nHowever:\nWithout proper insulation, the heat will eventually disappear. Additionally, heating with an infrared tube heater is an expensive decision.\nThe upfront cost of getting one of these is well above a thousand dollars.\nAdditionally, they’ll raise your electricity bill significantly.\nThat’s why I would avoid getting one of them, although they are a practical way to heat your garage without insulation.\n2. Install a wood stove Another option would be to install a wood stove in your garage. Because your garage is without insulation, you need a powerful heating system to compensate for that.\nWood stoves have the heating power you need.\nAdditionally, having one in your garage will add manly, cabin-like flair in your garage. It’ll feel like you are surviving in a deep forest.\nWood stoves are a perfect choice if you don’t have access to electricity in your garage.\nHowever:\nWood stoves require wood to run. If you hate chopping wood, skip this section.\nAlso, firing up a wood stove requires effort. If you want to heat your garage only occasionally, it might not be worth the trouble.\nFor keeping your garage warm, you first need to collect wood, then light a fire, wait for the wood to burn down and then collect the ashes.\nWhereas you can just switch on and off electric space heaters.\nIf you’re a passionate wood-chopper and you like saving money (wood is mostly cheaper than electricity) then a stove is for you.\nFor installing a wood stove in your garage, you’d also need to install an exhaust vent.\nBut it’s surprising how inexpensively you can do this:\nYou can get a wood stove kit for under 100$.\n3. Torpedo propane heater Torpedo propane heaters can heat your uninsulated garage incredibly well. They force out hot air with high velocity (like a jet engine) which in turn heats up your garage.\nAnd they look pretty cool. To me, a torpedo heater is the ultimate man’s toy.\ncredit: Becky Stern\nIt’s hot, dangerous, and blasts fire.\nMostly they run on propane gas, but there are also kerosene versions of them.\nPropane is, however, cheaper and safer indoors.\nBecause torpedo heaters start heating immediately (compared to a wood stove), they are great if you’re just occasionally in your garage.\nAlso, they are inexpensive for the power they can deliver.\nWith torpedo heaters, you should be careful about safety aspects. They can ignite stuff.\nSo, don’t use them if you are woodworking and producing dust which could light up in a fire.\nAt least, always have them at a safe distance.\nHere’s the torpedo heater I recommend:\nMr. Heater MH60QFAV 60,000 BTU Portable Propane Forced Air Heater (click to check the price on amazon) Just make sure you have a safe place for your torpedo heater. Because they blast so much air, they can even slide around if you put them on a slippery floor.\nSo, make sure you have a torpedo-safe spot in your garage before getting one.\nA garage forum member writes\n“My garage is a little bigger than yours, but it\u0026rsquo;s insulated (not that great at that) and my 70,000 BTU radiant torpedo burns me out of there.”\nsixball - member of garagejournal\nA 20 lb propane tank will last you 65 hours at low settings and 24 hours on full heat.\nIf you’re spending half an hour in your garage daily that’s nearly a two month’s supply on full heat.\n4. Propane heater Regular propane heaters (not the torpedos) are very durable as well. If you use one with a 20lb propane tank, it’ll last for months.\nBecause regular indoor propane heaters don’t force out hot air, they are more efficient than torpedos.\nIn contrast to torpedo heaters, indoor propane heaters are absolutely quiet. So, they’re useful if you need to concentrate.\nHowever, they don’t heat a garage as quickly.\nI’d recommend\nA torpedo heater if you need the whole garage hot ( quickly) A regular indoor propane heater if you want to keep warm \u0026amp; cozy and have time for the garage to heat up (you prefer silence and safety). Still, regular propane heaters are effective heaters for your garage. Because your garage is without insulation, you just need to give them a few minutes to heat.\nHere’s my recommendation:\nMr. Heater F274830 MH18BRV Big Buddy Grey Indoor-Safe Portable RV Propane Heater (click to check the price on amazon) The best thing about the Mr. Heater propane heater is that it is very safe to run indoors. It has automatic tip-over protection for example.\nSo, if it falls over, it’ll automatically shut off.\nAnd you can place them anywhere you like, even on your workbench.\nA torpedo heater needs much more care and sensitivity to be safe.\n5. Add basic insulation to your garage Even though the 4 different heater types I’ve just shown you are great for keeping your garage warm, you’ll waste energy as long as your garage is not insulated.\nThe final step (after getting one of the heaters) is to insulate your garage.\nHere’s a strategy:\nBuy a propane heater and see how well it heats your garage. Meanwhile, save money and spend it on basic insulation. Over time, you’ll have a heated \u0026amp; insulated garage. Don’t worry about spending money on insulation! You’ll easily earn it back in the long run because it will save you a significant amount of heating costs.\nWhere to insulate a garage first? The biggest heat sink of a garage is a bare metal roof. Because metal conducts heat well, and hot air rises, a metal roof will “wick away” the heat like a dry sponge would wick away water.\nA garage roof without insulation is nearly always a heat-sink.\nTherefore, I’d start with adding insulation material to your roof.\nI’m not an insulation expert, I’m an electrical engineer. But I’m sure that taping rigid foam to your ceiling will already add a lot to the insulation of your garage.\nDon’t worry about how it looks. Using tape is fine (I mean, it’s just a garage).\nSo, if you have a metal roof, start with insulating it first.\nThen, look out for air gaps. You can find them below the doors and maybe below the roof.\nEach garage is unique, so I can’t tell you where exactly to look out for air gaps. However, nearly always there are gaps below the doors.\n“If you fail to fill those air gaps, you\u0026rsquo;ll still be wasting a lot of heat.”\nthespruce- Garage Insulation Guide\nYou’ll definitely need to insulate these door gaps. To do so, get inexpensive door insulation tape and tape it below your door. They block air the air transfer and help a lot with insulation.\nWith an insulated roof and air-gap-free doors, you’re a big step ahead! I’d bet you’d save 50% on heating cost then.\nConclusion - How to heat a garage without insulation Answer: The best way to heat a garage without insulation is to get powerful, indoor safe propane heaters. Over time, you can then slowly add insulation to your garage: Insulate your ceiling with rigid foam and close air gaps under garage doors with door insulation tape.\nIn the long run, an insulated garage always beats a garage without insulation in terms of heating cost and comfort.\nAnd insulated garages don’t only keep you warm in the wintertime, they also stay cool in the summer.\nSo, you can benefit from them all year round.\nAttributions: title image by Wang\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/5-ways-to-heat-a-garage-without-insulation/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow can you heat a garage without insulation?

If yes, what do you have to consider for safety? And which kind of space heater is best for bathrooms? In this article, we’re going to cover all of these questions and a little more.\nBut first:\nCan you use a space heater in a bathroom? Answer: Yes, you can use a space heater in a bathroom as long as you do it responsibly. Even though there’s water vapor in the air, most space heaters are still able to run just fine. You can minimize the risk of an accident by sticking to the space-heater-bathroom safety tips below.\nMost people would initially think that you shouldn’t use a space heater in your bathroom. But that’s nonsense. As long as you stick to certain security measures, you’ll be safe.\nMost space heater accidents are caused by misuse and not by technical failure.\nTherefore, just make sure you follow the 5 tips below and you can safely use your space heater in your bathroom.\nEven the first tip will prevent 75% of accidents ( source).\n5 Safety Tips for using a Space Heater in a Bathroom So, let’s take a look at the safety tips for using a space heater in a bathroom.\n1. Make sure your bathroom has GFCI outlets The very first thing you need to check before using a space heater is whether your bathroom has ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets.\nThese safety outlets automatically shut off the power if there are slight fluctuations in current. Thus, they protect you in case your space heater gets faulty (e.g. when water enters the electronics).\nThey are sensitive and quick:\n“If the current flowing into the circuit differs by a very small amount (as little as 0.006 amperes) from the returning current, the GFCI interrupts power faster than a blink of an eye “\nGFCI Fact Sheet - United States Consumer Product Safety Commission\nGFCI outlets are required by law in all bathrooms that are built since 1975.\nIf your house is newer than that, you surely have GFCI outlets. If it’s older, please check your outlets. Maybe they have been upgraded in the meantime.\nYou can easily distinguish CFGI outlets from normal outlets because they have two big buttons built-in: One button says “RESET” and the other says “TEST”.\nIn case you don’t have any CFGI outlets in your bathroom, don’t use a space heater!\n2. Don’t use a cheap space heater in your bathroom Oftentimes space heaters are built very cheaply and suited just for supplemental heat. These are the heaters for under 30 bucks you can find in supermarkets.\nCheap space heaters are nearly always fragile and undependable. Water vapor could make the electronics rust and wear your space heater down quickly.\nIf you have a bathroom without a regular heating source, you’re probably rather looking for a permanent solution instead of something that works for just a season before it breaks.\nAdditionally, c heap space heaters often lack safety features that you absolutely need in your bathroom.\n“CPSC said that most electric heaters do not have protection against electrocution should the appliance come in contact with water.”\nCPSC Cautions\nThat’s why I recommend getting a quality space heater with high ratings where you can be sure it’ll reliably heat your bathroom.\nI’ll recommend a good space heater later on.\n3. Place your space heater in a safe spot in your bathroom Generally, you should place your space heater as far as possible from any water source.\nMostly, that’s in a corner of your bathroom.\nThe reason is that while most (quality) space heaters can handle water vapor, they can’t handle dense fluid water. Placing it away from water sources makes sure you don’t accidentally splash water on it.\nAdditionally, and even more importantly: Keep your space heater on the ground. Never place it in an elevated position.\nAs long as it’s on the ground you can be sure, it can’t fall down into the bathtub, your shower or your sink. All of that would have dangerous consequences.\nAnd you avoid that it hits the ground, breaks and exposes wires that carry electricity.\nAlways place your space heater on the ground and as far as possible from water sources.\n4. Prefer Powerful Hot Space Heaters in your Bathroom Here’s the most counterintuitive tip:\nIn bathrooms, powerful space heaters are the better choice.\nMost people worry about powerful space heaters. But in bathrooms, they are exactly what you need.\nBut why?\nA space heater that gets really hot evaporates the water in the air and dehumidifies the room- basically, it protects itself by reducing the amount of water that surrounds it.\nPowerful space heaters protect themselves.\nAdditionally, the more powerful your space heater is, the faster it will heat up and the shorter the time you need to preheat it.\nThat means you could save money on your electricity bill and reduce risks (the shorter your space heater runs, the smaller the risk of an accident).\nAlso, bigger heaters are better than smaller heaters. Because they are heavier and more stable, they’re less likely to tip over.\nThey heat faster and are more durable.\nPowerful space heaters outperform small, fragile space heaters in all ways when it comes to using them in a bathroom.\nGenerally, they are a more reliable choice.\n5. Air your bathroom after showering After showering or taking a bath, you should always air the bathroom.\nThe water vapor in the air could harm your space heater in the long run.\nTherefore, open the window right when you’re finished taking your bath.\nAiring your room with a space heater could theoretically be even more efficient as the heat prevents condensation of water. Thus, most of the humidity is in the air in the form of vapor and you can air your room more effectively.\nIf you don’t have a window in your bathroom, I recommend getting a strong ventilator to blow the humid air out of the bathroom and then open the windows in another room.\nBy airing your bathroom, you protect the electronics in your space heater from wearing down.\nIn the long run, rust could build-up in the electronic circuits of your space heater and decrease the efficiency.\nI’ve had electronic devices (a bike light for example) that suddenly stopped working and when I opened them to see why (I’m an electrical engineer - I have to open everything that’s broken), I discovered that everything was full of rust. After scraping off the rust, it worked just fine again.\nBut you should avoid all the hassle and just air your room.\nThe Best Space Heaters for your Bathroom I’ve found two space heaters really suited for bathrooms.\nThe first one is the Stiebel Eltron 074058 120-Volt 1500-Watts Wall Mounted Electric Fan Heater (click here to check the price on amazon).\nIt is specially designed for bathrooms and looks rather unsuspicious. You have to mount it to the wall.\n“This is a well built and aesthetically pleasing heating unit. I have this in an outdoor home office that is 180 square feet.”\nRainierRandy - Reviewer\nHowever, it is really difficult to hardwire this space heater. So, I only recommend it if you know something about electronics and you like putting effort into such things (and being proud afterward).\nThe alternative choice, and that’s the one I recommend for most people, is this one:\nThe Dr Infrared Heater Portable (click here to check the price on amazon) will get your bathroom heating job done.\nIt’s very powerful. It quickly \u0026amp; effortlessly heats a bathroom and helps with dehumidifying\n“This little heater heats the room so well and keeps it warm all night. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to buy another one of these”\nTyler - Reviewer\nConclusion Using a space heater in a bathroom is not dangerous at all as long as you follow these 5 safety tips.\nBy keeping them in mind all the time, you don’t have to worry about your space heater anymore.\nActually, you only have to remember airing your bathroom regularly.\nThe other tips are one-time considerations:\nYou only need to check whether your bathroom has CFGI outlets once. You only need to get rid of your cheap space heater once. Usually, you decide for one safe space heater spot in your bathroom and keep your space heater there. So that’s a one-time decision as well. And you only buy a powerful space heater that’s suited for your bathroom once. So, go through these space heater steps once and stay safe in your bathroom forever.\nI hope, I encouraged you to use your space heater safely and confidently in your bathroom.\nThe risk in your hands as long as you handle your heater with responsibility.\nRemember: Most accidents are caused by human misuse of the heater and not by the heater itself.\nAnyways, if you’re interested in more space heater articles, I’d recommend to check out this article:\n5 Space heaters you can leave unattended (Safe \u0026amp; Reliable)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/5-safety-tips-for-using-a-space-heater-in-a-bathroom/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you use a space heater in a bathroom?

And if yes, how can you find the safest ones?\nDon’t worry, I’ve done the work for you and found the safest space heaters you can get! These space heaters are the best choices for long heating periods and for leaving them unattended.\nThese are suited, for example, if you’re cooking something in the kitchen but you want to pre-heat your living room for a cozy movie night.\nTo find the safest space heaters, I’ve looked for certain security features:\nAs little exposed heating elements as possible (preferably no red glowing parts) Timers you can set so the heater automatically turns off Tip-over \u0026amp; overheat protection Generally, you should never leave a space heater unattended if you’re not at home. But in certain situations, this might be necessary:\nFor example in an emergency, where your house heating doesn’t work, so you need a space heater to prevent your pipes from freezing. In such a case, leaving a space heater unattended would make sense.\nBut never do it for no reason.\nLater on in this list, I’ll show you a space heater that actually has an anti-freeze protection: It automatically heats the room just enough to keep your pipes from freezing.\nIn this article, I’m going to show you the safest space heaters you can get. That doesn’t mean you can leave them running 24/7. Handle your space heater responsibly and follow the safety guidelines at the end of this post.\n1. Free Standing Electric Fireplace Stove by e-Flame The e-Flame freestanding electric fireplace stove (click here to check the price on amazon) looks like (as the name suggests) an actual stove!\nI decided to put it on this list mainly because of two reasons:\nIt has legs that keep it on a safe distance from the floor. This reduces the heat that can accumulate below it.\nThat’s why it’s safe for all flooring types and definitely worth considering if you have a special floor that you want to be absolutely safe about.\nThe freestanding electric stove by e-Flame is therefore good for carpet floors, which are easily inflammable.\nThe second reason I like this type of heater is that it is cool to the touch.\nEven though it looks like a stove (that would indeed get hot on the surface) it works in a completely different way, which makes it safe to touch and therefore a good option if you have pets or kids at home.\nIt also has tip-over protection that automatically shuts it off in case it falls over.\nSadly, it has no built-in timer (as the other candidates in the list below) where you can decide when it shuts off automatically. So, I suggest to only leave this space heater running unattended when you’re at home, but just in another room.\n2. Dyson Hot + Cool Jet Focus AM09 Fan Heater The Dyson Hot + Cool fan heater (click here to check the price on amazon) looks comparably modern and suits you if you want your space heater to look good.\nWhat I like about it is that it can heat and cool with the built-in fan. You can use it year-round!\nIn summer you can choose to just use the fan function, and in winter you can add heat as you wish.\nAdditionally, this space heater has no exposed heating elements (which I love)! It blows hot air, but it’s impossible to burn yourself.\nEven though it’s blowing air, there are no fast-spinning blades.\nBecause of the protective design, it doesn’t get hot to the touch.\nYou can leave this thing unattended safely (for example while you sleep) because it has an automatic shut-off timer. Just set the hours after which you want it to stop heating and it will automatically do so.\nAlso, it has tip-over protection that instantly turns your heater off if someone accidentally falls over it.\n3. Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater Here’s the best-rated heater in this list: The Dr Infrared Heater Portable (click here to check the price on amazon).\nI chose to include it in this list because it comes very handy if you want to place it somewhere in your room, where there’s no wall outlet.\nBut why?\nThis space heater comes with a 72-inch long electric cord. For space heaters, that’s really practical, because you should never use an extension cord with them.\nThe 72-inch long cord allows you to freely place it in any (safe) spot you like.\nAdditionally, it has a tip-over \u0026amp; overheat-protection.\nAnd it comes with a built-in timer that you can set up to 12 hours before it shuts off.\nIt’s cool to the touch and has a thermostat you can set the temperature with.\nThermostats make sure that space heaters don’t overheat and they help with heating efficiently.\nThe Dr Infrared Heater Portable is certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) USA and Canada.\nUL certifies only space heaters that fulfill strict safety conditions. For example, they say that they do “abnormal operation tests” ( source), where they test space heaters for proper functionality and safety.\nOf course, this space heater is cool to the touch as well.\n4. DeLonghi TRD40615E Full Room Radiant Heater The DeLonghi radiant heater (click here to check the price on amazon) comes with a handy digital thermostat to control the temperature.\nOf course, it also has an automatic shut-off function to prevent overheating.\nBut:\nThat’s not why I included it in this list.\nI included the DeLonghi radiant heater because it’s, in my opinion, the ultimate emergency heater!\nWhy?\nIt has an antifreeze setting that automatically warms up the heater to prevent the room from freezing. This way you can protect pipes from freezing (which is incredibly expensive to repair).\nWhen you have a room that has no heating system, I’d get this one, simply because of the antifreeze setting.\nThis heater is, in fact, designed so you can leave it unattended.\nAdditionally, it has a built-in timer so you can decide when you want it to shut off.\n5. Pelonis Oil Filled Radiator Here’s our most affordable candidate: The Pelonis oil-filled radiator (click here to check the price on amazon).\nI am totally convinced this space heater will do the job for most people. I love that you can get it below 100 bucks.\nIt has everything you need:\nThe Pelonis oil-filled radiator has a built-in thermostat that regulates the temperature in your room, a 10-hour shut-off timer, a remote control so you can control it from your bed without standing up, automatic tip-over protection and overheating protection.\nAnd on top of that, it’s ETL certified.\n“Both UL and ETL are reputable testing companies and they both test to the identical standard”\nETL uses the same standards like UL, so there’s no difference in the certifications.\nThis makes the Pelonis oil-filled radiator a perfect choice for you if you look to keep your room warm and safe without spending too much money.\nIt actually comes with more features than all the other space heaters in this list.\nAnd it has a great rating on amazon. It seems to be a very good choice.\nRequirements for space heaters you can leave unattended For this list of space heaters, you can leave unattended, I have set standards for my research. I included only space heaters that come with the following features:\ntip-over protection overheat protection timer (you don’t need to heat throughout your absence) no exposed heating elements you can touch them without burning your fingers Additionally, I preferred heaters with certifications. Other security features are a bonus, but not required, such as the antifreeze protection of the DeLonghi space heater.\nSpace heater safety guidelines Even though you can consider all of the space heaters I just listed as safe, the main reason of fault is not the space heater itself, but human failure:\nMore than 80% of space heater accidents are caused by misuse and not due to technical failure.\nTherefore, you should always keep the following guidelines in mind. Use your space heater responsibly.\nA space heater should be placed in a safe distance from inflammable objects.\nThe leading factor contributing to ignition for home heating fire deaths (54%) was heating equipment too close to things that can burn, such as upholstered furniture, clothing, mattress, or bedding.\nNational Fire Protection Association - Home fires involving heating equipment\nRun your space heater only if you really need to. And think twice about leaving it unattended:\nWhich benefit do you get? Is it an emergency to keep your pipes from freezing? Or is it just for luxury purposes (having a warm room when you come home)?\nGenerally, space heaters can heat rooms very quickly. So you don’t need to leave them on continuously. Minimize the risk.\nNever leave children or pets unattended with a space heater Never ever leave children or pets unattended with a space heater! Children and pets are too unpredictable to cover the risks of something happening. According to the famous Moore’s law: “What can go wrong, will go wrong”.\nKeep this law in mind and avoid even the slightest possible point of failure.\nNever use an extension cord with your space heater. Extension cords (especially cheap ones) heat up quickly and can increase the power usage of your space heater. This makes it more likely that something overheats.\nI’ve already written an article on this that you can check out.\nConclusion - Space heaters you can leave unattended The safest types of space heaters you can leave unattended are big space heaters that don’t get overly hot on their surface and that are equipped with many safety features.\nAs long as you treat them carefully, you can leave the room for a few minutes and leave them unattended to do something else quickly.\nBut never leave your house with a space heater running. It’s just too risky.\nAttributions: title image by Tony Webster\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/space-heaters-you-can-leave-unattended/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre there any space heaters you can leave unattended?

Currently, I’m sitting in my dorm, with cold feet. My radiator (for some reason) decided not to heat this evening. Even though I can layer clothes and socks to keep warm, using a space heater would help so much.\nBut:\nAre space heaters even allowed in dorms?\nIf you’re not sure whether your college allows space heaters in dorms, you’re in the right place. In this article, we’re going to cover everything you need to know about space heater rules in college dorms.\nNot all universities have equal rules, but after researching I noticed a pattern that most universities followed. After reading this guide, you’ll know how to handle a space heater in your dorm and how to find out whether your college allows space heaters.\nAre space heaters allowed in dorms? Not all universities set the exact same rules for space heaters. That seems to have to do with the age of the residence building and the strictness of the individual university.\nOf course, it makes sense to consider fire hazards and increased electricity usage. But when it gets freezing cold in the winter, helping yourself with a space heater would be a god’s gift.\nOftentimes, college dorms have set up strict security guidelines everyone has to follow.\nIf you’re unlucky, space heaters might even be prohibited in your dorm.\nWhile some universities completely prohibit space heaters, others set up certain rules to follow, and a few others don’t restrict the use of space heaters at all.\nAn example of space heater dorm guidelines For example:\nThe University of Louisville only allows space heaters that follow certain guidelines. Here are some of them.\nThe space heater must have built-in tip-over protection (it should automatically shut off when it falls over). The power usage should be 1500W at max. You can’t use an extension cord (here’s our article that explains why you shouldn’t use extension cords with space heaters) The space heater must have a nationally recognized testing laboratory seal Additionally, they have restrictions on the placement of the heater. For example, you should place in a certain distance from walls and inflammable objects.\nWhile these guidelines sound strict at first you can actually fulfill them with most space heaters.\nIn contrast, Stanford University completely allows space heaters and recommends some sustainability guidelines meaning you should just keep an eye on electricity usage.\nIf you’re unlucky you belong to one of the dorms which totally prohibit space heaters like at Michigan State University.\nIf you keep reading, you’ll find a short list of some universities and whether they allow space heaters.\nWhy are space heaters not allowed in all dorms? In the news, you always hear about house fires that were caused by unattended space heaters. Universities are afraid of this. Think of their reputation in case a space heater fire breaks out in one of their dorms.\nSpace heaters are a potential fire hazard. That’s why some universities prohibit the use of them.\nSpace heaters could overload and damage the main power supply.\nIf a few people in your dorm use space heaters at the same time, chances are that some fuses blow.\nAnd on top of that, your rent oftentimes includes the electricity bill. No matter how much electricity you use, your rent stays the same. At least that’s the case in my dorm. To avoid extra costs and increase the profit margins, your dorm wants to keep the electric bill low and prohibits space heaters (sad, but true).\nHere’s what Stanford says:\nThere are approximately 1,000 space heaters on campus that together cost the university $150,000 per year.\nStanford University - Space Heater How-to Guide\nHowever, I believe (and most universities have recognized that as well) that space heaters are not bombs or dangerous chemicals. If you handle them responsibly, you can minimize the risk.\nMicrowaves are dangerous as well. That’s why everyone is following the guideline to not put cutlery in it.\nSo, certain dorms decided to set up security guidelines and allow the usage of space heaters if you follow the rules.\nIndividual University Examples - Does your University allow space heaters? Here’s a quick list of universities and their space heater rules for dorms.\nMIT- Allowed, with security guidelines University of Louisville - Restricted, only if you follow guidelines - preferably radiant heaters Stanford - Allowed, but recommend sustainability guidelines University of Washington - Strongly discouraged, but not prohibited Michigan State University - Prohibited University of Wisconsin - Strictly limited As you can see, the regulations vary from university to university. To find out whether your university allows space heaters, just google for “your university space heater dorms”.\nIf you don’t find any results you can speak to the property management and ask them.\nBut I’d just assume that if there are no rules prohibiting space heaters, they’re allowed.\nHow to keep warm in a cold dorm It feels like college dorms are always older buildings with sporadically working heating systems. And sometimes it seels like nothing works as it should.\nCollege dorms often have an old and ineffective heating system.\nI used to be in one where you had no radiator but hot water pipes running through each room. The worst about it was that the pipes were never hot and you couldn’t do anything about it, because there was no thermostat to control them.\nOn top of that, universities insist to use these heating systems. I believe it’s because they want to save energy. They say these heating systems are energy-efficient (of course they are if they don’t heat at all).\nIn extreme cases they keep the room barely above freezing temperature - that’s why I believe space heaters make sense\nBut how can you heat your college dorm?\nHot plates and toaster ovens should never be used for space heating.\nUniversity of Massachusetts space heater policy\nWell, of course, that’s not a good idea.\nLet’s take a look at how you can keep warm in a cold dorm.\nElectric blanket Electric blankets are the best heating choice if space heaters are not allowed in your dorm. You can snuggle up in the blanket and be comfortable.\nElectric blankets are great if you’re alone in your dorm. You can keep yourself warm.\nIf you have guests, you can turn on the electric blanket and put it on your bed. For sure this will raise the temperature by a few degrees.\nSpace heaters As long as you use space heaters according to the guidelines of the University of Louisville above, you’ll certainly be safe. As long as you follow the rules, space heaters are not as dangerous as many people fear.\nHowever, you don’t really know how fragile the house power supply of your college dorm is. You don’t want to be the reason for a blown fuse.\nTherefore, I recommend using heaters that use less than 1000W of power. Most 1500W heaters have a power setting, where you can decrease the heat to 750W.\nPersonally, I own an 800W infrared heater, and it’s working well for my dorm.\nConclusion - Are space heaters allowed in dorms? Answer: In most dorms, space heaters are allowed to use if you follow certain guidelines. These guidelines are about placing the space heater in a safe spot, using only certified space heaters, built-in tip-over protection and using not more than 1500W power. In fact, most space heaters fulfill these guidelines and you can responsibly use your space heater in your dorm.\nIf your dorm prohibits the use of space heaters, electric blankets are an effective and safe alternative.\nThey’ll keep you warm, even if the heating system of your dorm doesn’t work properly.\nAlways dress appropriately, drink hot beverages (I love to drink tea to keep warm), and wear thick socks.\nNot only will these things keep you warm, but you’ll also be more comfortable.\nSpace heaters are not the only solution to heat a college dorm. If they are allowed, use them. If not, there’s so much more you can do. So, don’t worry.\nI hope I could help you with this article!

In this article, we’re going to cover all of these questions so you can stop worrying!\nAfter reading this, you’ll know exactly how to use a space heater and stay safe - even with a cat in your house.\nI totally understand your worries. This is a headline of a blog post I found online\n“Pet owners, beware! Cat gets toasted by a space heater”\nJoan Coello\nAnd below that headline, there’s this image of a cat with -indeed - slightly toasted fur. She just got too comfortable in front of the space heater.\nIn this post, you’ll learn exactly how you can cat-safe your space heater so your cat doesn’t end up toasted as well.\nAre space heaters safe for cats? As you can tell from the image I just showed you, not all space heaters are safe for cats. And not all cats are suited for space heaters.\nThere are two conditions that have to be fulfilled so you can use a space heater with a cat safely:\nYou need a pet-safe space heater. Your cat should have certain character traits (I’ll list them later on). First, we’re going to cover the space heater part. And later on, we’ll check whether your cat is suited for space heaters or not.\nWhich space heaters are safe for cats? Lots of cat breeds have fluffy fur which is the most vulnerable part of your cat (regarding space heaters). In the worst case, it might even catch fire.\nSo, let’s find out which space heaters you should not use when you have a cat at home.\nGenerally, you should avoid all space heaters with exposed heating elements.\nAlso, cats love to tip over stuff. Therefore, a solid and heavy space heater that is hard to tip over is a good choice. With a cat at home, you should always play safe - even though you might think your cat won’t tip anything over, unexpected things can happen quite often.\nI could make various recommendations, but let’s stick to the two best ones.\nCat-safe space heaters are ceramic space heaters with a protected heating element or oil-filled space heaters.\nFrom these two recommendations, the oil-filled space heaters are the best choice, because they’re quite heavy (solid metal with oil) in comparison to the ceramic heaters (usually plastic).\nOil-filled space heaters are effective for heating but they don’t get burning hot to the touch. That’s why I generally recommend them if you have pets (like birds) or kids at home.\nThey usually also have tip-over protection as well as a thermostat and overheat protection. From my perspective, oil-filled radiators are the safest form of portable heating.\nHere’s the one I recommend:\nDeLonghi Oil-Filled Radiator Space Heater, Quiet 1500W (click here to check the price on amazon) Image by monnibo\nOther safety tips for space heaters and cats Most space heaters you can buy are 1500W heaters. They are quite powerful. But when your cat is around, you could also use a 750W space heater instead of a 1500W one. It’s less likely to harm your cat.\nOftentimes, space heaters have a setting to decrease the power usage from 1500W to 750W. This will decrease the temperature and therefore lower the risk of an accident.\nOftentimes, you’ll find safety tips like:\nKeep your space heater in a safe distance from your cat.\nBut these people are obviously not cat owners. Everyone knows that cats can reach about every point in your room. So that’s nonsense.\nA space heater you should never use with cats At home, I have the worst space heater you can think of for cats. It’s an 800W infrared heater with exposed heating elements that are protected only using a thin metal grid.\nEven though it’s just 800W, it gets very hot to the touch - I just tried it and nearly burned my fingers.\nSpace heaters with exposed heating elements are not safe for cats.\nEven though this space heater is perfectly fine for me, it’s not for cats. Cats like to lie down right in front of it. If your cat’s fur would touch the hot metal grid, it might turn toasty brown.\nIf you have a space heater with exposed heating elements as well definitely go lower than 800W, it’s just way too hot. I can decrease my power to 400W (using the knob at the top), which I think is fine for cats. The metal grid is not burning hot then.\nA 1500W space heater is fine as long as it distributes the heat in a protected way (like the oil-filled space heater I recommended above). But protected ceramic space heaters with a fan blowing hot air are fine as well.\nIs your cat suited for space heaters? So, now that you know what you should look out for when you get a space heater, here are some aspects you should look out for regarding your cat.\nGenerally speaking, cats can learn their lesson.\nIn a forum, I saw someone writing about his wood stove. Each evening he would heat his house with the stove. In the morning, his three cats would curl up on top of the stove enjoying the remaining heat.\nHe said that each of his cats at least once tried to jump on the stove when it was still hot. And each of his cats burned her paws.\nBut: They all learned their lessons and now they always check whether they can jump on the stove or whether they should wait for it to cool down.\nI am telling you this, so you realize that cats are not stupid. They can learn new stuff and you don’t need to overprotect everything.\nAnyways:\nHere are some questions to answer before you get a space heater. They’ll help you decide whether you should get a fully pet-safe oil filled heater or whether a regular heater is fine.\nDoes your cat love to tip over stuff? Does your cat curl up in front of the radiator, oven, or on your lap? (Does she love heat?) Is your cat curious? Do you think she’ll spend attention to the space heater? How old is your cat? (Older cats are usually sluggish and won’t do dangerous experiments with the heater) If you have a young, playful and destructive cat, better go safe and get the oil-filled heater.\nIn case your cat is rather unresponsive and boring, you don’t need to worry much.\nWhy do cats love space heaters? “As descendants of ancient desert animals, domestic cats are hard-wired to thrive in toasty climates.”\nMother Nature Network\nThat’s why cats crave for heat - they are genetically dependent on it - that also explains why they love human laps, radiators and space heaters.\nIt’s like keeping a penguin at home (just the reverse way). A penguin would always look for cool spots in your home because his genetics are made for cool environments.\nIn the wintertime, cats oftentimes actively look for heat sources if they feel uncomfortably cool in your home.\nThat’s why you often find images of cats in front of space heaters online.\nBy getting a space heater, you can actually improve the well-being and comfort of your cat and make your home a better place for her to stay.\nConclusion - Are space heaters safe for cats? Answer: Yes, space heaters are safe for cats as long as you use a heater that doesn’t expose heating elements and that is difficult to tip over. Generally, oil-filled radiators are the best electric heaters you can get for cats.\nIn case your cat is rather sluggish, a regular space heater will do the job as well.\nI would just make sure that the space heater you use does not get hot enough to burn the fur. You can mostly set your space heater’s thermostat to a lower level, which is already a solid safety measure.\nAttributions: title image by Mr.TinDC\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/are-space-heaters-safe-for-cats/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSpace heaters and cats - is that a safe combination?

So, is it a practical solution to connect a space heater to your car battery? I’m an electrical engineer, and I’ll show you how it would work!\nQuestion: Can you run a space heater off a car battery?\nAnswer: Yes, you can run a space heater off a car battery. You would need to convert the DC current to AC first and then transform it to 120V. So, in theory, it’s possible. But can a car battery handle such loads? And how long would it last? And are there better ways to stay warm?\nLet’s answer all these questions:\nAt the end of this article, I’ll give you a much better alternative for heating than trying to run a space heater off your car battery.\nHow much power does a space heater need? Most space heaters in the US need about 1500W of power. That’s quite a lot. Most space heaters draw 12.5 amps.\nHeaters are among the household devices that need the most power.\nHere’s what the Ohio State University says:\n“While any amount of current over 10 milliamps (0.01 amp) is capable of producing painful to severe shock, currents between 100 and 200 mA (0.1 to 0.2 amp) are lethal.”\nOhio State University - Physics\nNow, if 0.1-0.2A are lethal already, think of what 12.5A can do.\nHeaters need a lot of power.\nHere’s another example:\n“A climber who raises his own body weight (say 70 kg or 154 lb) by moving up a slope of 10 meters (33 feet) vertical height in one minute is working at the rate of 0.15 horsepower or 114 watts”\nAmerican Alpine Club\nThat means that 1500W, the power a space heater needs to run, would equal the power you need to climb 132 meters (433 feet) vertically in a minute.\nCan you run a space heater off a car battery? If you want to run a space heater off a car battery, you first need to know how much power a car battery can deliver.\n“A standard small car battery is about 45 ampere-hours. That means that it will supply over two amps for 20 hours. A battery should not be discharged at a higher current draw, or asked to deliver more amps than its amp/hour rating divided by 10”\nUH Manoa Chemistry Department\nIf short-circuited, car batteries can deliver up to 300A (caution: extremely dangerous). So, they are capable of producing 12.5 amperes of current for a space heater. However, according to what the quote above says, you shouldn’t discharge a car battery at a higher current draw than it’s rating divided by 10.\nFor a 45 ampere-hour battery, that would mean you should keep the discharge rate below 4.5A to keep the battery healthy. But most space heaters require 10-15A.\nBut in an emergency situation, where you need to keep warm, you don’t care about that rate. So, theoretically, a car battery can produce enough energy to run a space heater.\nNote: This is just a theoretical result. We’ll cover whether it makes sense later on. There’s a lot more to keep in mind.\nYou would need an inverter and a transformer Car batteries only deliver DC current. Household space heaters need AC. So, you would need to install an electrical inverter (a device that transforms DC to AC).\nAdditionally, car batteries have a voltage of 12V, whereas a space heater needs 120V (or 240V in Europe). For increasing the voltage, you’d need to use a transformer.\nTo connect and run a space heater off a car battery, you’d need to connect the space heater to a transformer, the transformer to an inverter, and the inverter to the battery. To me, that sounds like a big hassle. Especially if you’re unfamiliar with electronics.\nAnd it’s dangerous as well.\nHow long would a car battery last with a space heater? Let’s assume that you have a car battery with a capacity of 45 ampere-hours. A regular space heater draws 12.5A. That would mean your car battery would last for 3.6 hours with a space heater.\nAnd we didn’t even account for the energy losses of the inverter and transformer.\nStill, the 3.6 hours are more than I initially expected. Car batteries can store huge amounts of energy because they consist of many smaller battery packs that are connected to each other.\nTo me, that’s an impressive result.\nDownsides of powering a space heater with a car battery This is going to be the most important part of this article. We’re going to cover whether it actually makes sense to power a space heater with a car battery. Let’s take a look at all the risks and downsides:\nHigh current draw puts stress on car battery: The high amount of current your space heater needs puts a lot of stress on your space heater. If you remember what we talked about before, you shouldn’t pull more than 4.5A from a car battery. A space heater easily surpasses this limit. Your car battery is likely to overheat and get permanently damaged.\nConnecting a space heater to it would put the same stress on your battery as cranking the engine continuously (for hours)! Risk of damage: You simply shouldn’t play around with such high current devices. Car batteries and space heaters are a dangerous combination. Especially when you accidentally connect something the wrong way. Drain battery: In an emergency, it might be a better decision to use your car battery to drive somewhere instead of using it to produce heat. Cars have poor insulation: This, of course, only applies if you use the space heater in a car. Cars usually have poor insulation and the heat will quickly disappear. Heating in a car is incredibly inefficient. Alternatives for keeping warm in an energy outage There are some alternatives for keeping warm when you don’t have access to electricity that you need to consider before even thinking about using a car battery.\nCar space heaters There are car space heaters that are specially made for cars. You can directly connect them to your car battery. Usually, they are smaller than regular space heaters, but they are just fine for keeping the temperature up in a car.\nAt home: Indoor propane heaters For heating a home without electricity, the very best way I know of is using an indoor propane heater. One 20lb propane tank can keep your room warm for up to a week! When I reviewed whether you can use a generator to power a space heater, I also concluded that propane heaters are a safer, more efficient and more durable method to keep warm without electricity.\nHere’s the propane heater I recommend (click here to check the price on amazon).\nConclusion - Can you run a space heater off a car battery? Answer: Yes, with a little technical know-how, you can run a space heater off a car battery. But you shouldn’t! Even though it might work, you will permanently damage your car battery. Additionally, it will only keep you warm for around 3 hours until the battery is drained and it’s dangerous as well (you’re playing with high current devices).\nInstead, you should get an indoor propane heater to keep warm in an energy outage. One 20lb propane tank will keep you warm for a week. It’s just a much wiser choice.\nI hope this article could help you!

This is a question many people ask because you could save so much energy by automatically switching off a space heater.\n“Dial outlet timers are simple to employ - just plug them into an outlet, then plug your device into them and set the timer.”\nCecilia Harsch - Hunker\nYou could, for example, heat your bedroom while you sleep and automatically switch off the space heater at 1 am in order to save some money on your electric bill.\nBut is that even possible? Are space heaters suited for timer switches?\nIn this article, you’re going to learn whether you can plug a space heater into an outlet timer and what you should look out for!\nBut first, the quick answer.\nQuestion: Can you plug a space heater into a timer?\nAnswer: Yes, you can plug a space heater into a timer as long as it doesn’t surpass the power limits of the timer. Most timers can handle the amount of power a space heater needs. However, you should still check the power requirements of your timer switch for safety reasons.\nBut to verify whether you can use your timer together with your space heater, you first need to know what’s important to consider.\nHow much power do space heaters need? Usually, space heaters draw a lot of power: 1500W to be exact. That is about as much as 3 desktop gaming computers at once.\nOftentimes they also have a medium-heat mode, where you can set the power to be 750W or similar.\nIt doesn’t matter whether your heater is an infrared, ceramic or electrical heater. Nearly all of them need 1500 watts of power. But why?\nWell, in order to heat properly, space heaters draw as much power as they can get. A space heater with less power would not be as effective. So, all companies design their space heater to run at 1500W, which is what your house energy supply can deliver.\nHow much power can a timer handle? Usually, electrical timer switches can handle about 1800W of power.\nThe reason they can handle so much is that they are oftentimes built using a relay, which is an electrical switch that is suited for switching on and off very high currents. Relays are used whenever you need to switch lots of power.\nThat’s why timers are usually safe to operate with high-power devices. Therefore they can switch on and off fridges, lights (which draw a lot of current) and air conditioners.\nBut can electrical timers also handle space heaters?\nFirst, let’s take a look at what you definitely cannot do.\nNever plug multiple space heaters into a timer Generally speaking, every time you plug in more than one space heater into your power supply (via power strip), you blow a fuse somewhere. The reason is that your power supply can not deliver more than 15 to 20 Amps of current.\nBy using only a second space heater, most power supplies will have to surrender.\nIt’s similar for timers:\nBecause most outlet timers are rated at 15 to 20A, they can not handle more than one space heater at a time. Most space heaters need about 12.5A (sometimes more, sometimes less).\nCan you plug a space heater into a timer? Yes, you can plug a space heater into most timers. Just make sure to check the rating of the timer.\nIs it rated at 15A? Fine!\nIs it rated below 15A? Then, I’d suggest looking for another outlet timer just to make sure you don’t burn or destroy something accidentally.\nUsually, you can find the rating of an electrical timer switch somewhere at the side or the bottom of the case. If you can not see it, research your switch online, or just use another one where you’re sure it can handle 15A.\nStill, oftentimes people worry about plugging a space heater into a timer switch because the switch is a small resistance.\nThis resistance causes a voltage drop. Because your house’s power supply wants to deliver the 1500W to your space heater, it has to increase the current.\nThese effects are, however, negligible and only make a safety risk when you’re using a cheap extension cord with your space heater (see the article: Can I use an extension cord with my space heater?).\nGenerally, most timer switches are safe to operate with a space heater.\nSafety tips for plugging space heaters in timers Still, you should always keep some safety aspects in mind if you want to keep your house safe while running a space heater.\nIndependently of a timer, you should never run a space heater in your absence. Space heaters draw big currents and produce high heat. It’s possible that something accidentally catches fire. Turn off the heater when you’re not at home. Only use a timer where you are absolutely sure it can handle the amount of power your space heater needs. Check the power limits of your timer and your space heater. Oftentimes, it is practical to sleep with a space heater on. When you use a timer to switch it off at night, you can save some money on your electricity bill. However, I’d suggest the following: While you sleep, use a low power setting on your space heater. Most heaters have a 750W setting which decreases the chance that something overheats. If you are not sure whether your space heater is safe to run, you could also look for a new one. Modern space heaters are, in my opinion, very safe. Oftentimes they have an overheat protection, an automatic shut off when it tips over and they don’t get hot on the surface.\nEspecially when you’re using a very old space heater, getting a new one is a good idea.\nWhich timer should you use? Generally, I’d say that nearly every timer you can get is fine. You can just go to any supermarket that sells them and buy one. Most timers are safe to use with space heaters.\nMy attitude:\nDon’t overthink.\nTimers are designed to handle high power devices. You shouldn’t worry too much about it.\nCan you plug a space heater into a smart plug? Yes, you can plug a space heater into a smart plug. Similar to regular timers, smart plugs are suited for handling high-power devices like fridges, heaters, etc. so you don’t need to worry at all.\nUsing a smart plug for your space heater is actually a pretty good idea. Not only can you automatically shut it off, but you can also see how much power your heater uses.\nIn the long run, a smart plug could even save you money. If you see how much energy your space heater requires, you are less likely to overuse it.\nAlternative: Get a space heater with a built-in timer Oftentimes, space heaters already have a built-in timer function. Heaters with built-in timers are reliable, as the manufacturer should have tested that everything works properly.\nSo you can rely on the timer to work.\nIn contrast, if you did everything yourself, even if you are not really familiar with electricity, you might miss something and damage your heater accidentally.\nNevertheless, I think regular timers should be suited for nearly all space heaters and you shouldn’t worry too much.\nIf your space heater doesn’t have a built-in timer already, then I’d only buy a new space heater if you feel really uncomfortable installing a regular timer yourself.\nConclusion - Can you plug a space heater into a timer? Answer: Y es, you can plug a space heater safely into a timer. Most timers are designed to work with devices that require huge amounts of power. So, using a space heater with an electrical timer switch should be safe.\nJust quick-check the amp rating of your timer. If it’s at 15-20A, you’re fine. If it’s below 10A, I’d look for another timer switch, because most space heaters draw more current.\nI hope I could help you out with this article!

I mean, that would be incredibly practical and would save you so much money on tanning products.\n“I love the sun but don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to get a good tan and keep it year-round, so I am a huge fan of tanning products.”\nKim Kardashian\nIf you’re like the Kardashians and prefer to get your tan at home rather than outdoors, here’s the right place. In this article, we’ll find out whether you can use a space heater to tan your skin.\nAfter reading this, you’ll know exactly how you can build your time at home (I promise).\nBut first, let’s check the quick answer.\nQuestion: Can you get a tan from a space heater?\nAnswer: No, you can not get a tan from a space heater. For tanning, you need UV light, which no heater can emit. To produce UV light that would be suitable for tanning you would need to create insane amounts of heat or use a UV indoor tanning lamp.\nHow do you get a tan? Before we head on, let’s first cover how tanning actually works.\nTanning is a reaction from your skin that occurs when you expose it to UV radiation. When UV radiation hits your skin, your skin produces melanin - a pigment that protects your skin from radiation and damage.\nFun fact: Tanning is actually a protective reaction and has nothing to do with health.\nIt’s like working out in a gym: Building muscle is, in fact, only a reaction of your body that protects you from future damage (by lifting weights).\nAnyways:\nNow that you know how tanning generally works, are there any space heaters that you can use to build a tan?\nFirst, let’s take a look at the types of heaters that we can exclude right away.\nTypes of space heaters that don’t emit radiation (and can\u0026rsquo;t get you a tan) If you want to get a tan, you need to expose your skin to radiation (as you’ve just learned). Here’s a quick and simple list of the heaters that don’t emit any kind of radiation. These will definitely not work for tanning.\nCeramic Heaters Electric Heaters Gas Heaters (Propane, Kerosene) Oil-filled heaters Radiators (even though their name suggests they emit radiation) If you want to be very precise about this: All of the above heaters do emit radiation, but the amounts are so little, they can’t have any tanning effect on your skin. They don’t work by radiating, but by convecting hot air.\nLet’s take a look at the types of heaters that do emit radiation. They could be potential candidates.\nTypes of space heaters that emit radiation Infrared heaters (also called radiant heaters) are the only type of heater that works by emitting radiation.\nThe purpose of infrared radiation is that it is directly converted to heat when it hits an object. It’s similar to sun rays. Sunrays don’t really heat the air, but the objects they hit.\nSo:\nCan you use infrared radiation for tanning?\nThe answer lies in the next section \u0026hellip;\nSunlight vs. Infrared Heater for tanning: Comparing the spectrum of light There’s a significant difference between sunlight and infrared radiation. Take a look at the graphic below.\nLight is composed of different colors, called the spectrum. The spectrum basically tells you which colors the light is composed of.\nThe sun’s spectrum of light ranges from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared light.\nRemember: Only UV radiation has a tanning effect.\nBut how does pure infrared radiation look like?\nInfrared radiation is just a very small part of the far right side of the spectrum. It has nothing to do with UV. Infrared radiation has absolutely no effects on tanning - it just heats your skin.\nBy the way: The infrared part of the sunlight keeps you warm, while the UV part causes tans (and sunburns). The visible colors in between make up the colors we can perceive in the world. That’s how each part of the sunlight’s spectrum has its own use.\nCan you get a tan from an infrared space heater? Answer: No, you can not get a tan from an infrared space heater. In fact, you can’t get a tan from any kind of heater.\nInfrared heaters only emit infrared radiation, which is the warmth you perceive, but for tanning, you would need UV radiation.\nLater on, I’ll show you how you can get a tan indoors anyways.\nWhy do infrared heaters not emit UV radiation? The main purpose of an infrared space heater is to heat a room. In theory, it would be possible to build a heater that tans and heats at the same time. The heater would just need to imitate sunlight and emit all parts of the spectrum.\nBut that’s only possible in theory. Why?\nIf you heat an object really, really hot it can emit UV radiation. But that heat must be over 10,000 degrees celsius. That’s why the sun emits UV light: Because it’s so incredibly hot.\nAdditionally, most people are looking for just the heat part when they want to buy a space heater. If you added UV radiation to a space heater, it would just need more energy to run without increasing the heat at all. We don’t perceive UV radiation as heat.\nIn fact, no common heat source you can think of is suitable for tanning. You can’t use fires for tanning, you can’t use radiators, and ovens are not suitable for tanning as well.\nYou could sit in front of a space heater for weeks and not get any tan at all. Most likely, a space heater will not even change your skin tan if you sit in front of it for years.\nSo, if you want to get a tan indoors, you have to look out for something else than a space heater.\nHow to get a tan indoors Getting a tan indoors is actually a lot easier than you think. You already have all the knowledge you need: You need some kind of UV light source.\nIndoor tanning actually makes a lot of sense. Not only do you get the tan you wish for, but your body also produces vitamin D, a healthy vitamin that protects you from all kinds of sicknesses and improves your health.\nLuckily, there are alternative sources of UV light. You don’t always have to go out and sunbathe. That would be impractical during the wintertime anyway.\nTo get a tan indoors, I’ve found the most practical (and affordable) way is to get an indoor tanning lamp.\nHere’s the one I recommend:\nSperti Fiji Sun Home Tanning Lamp - Face and Body Sunlamp (click here to check the price on amazon) - I know one guy who even got a sunburn from it! So pay attention, this thing really works. I didn’t expect such a small product to replace a solarium. These UV tanning lamps work not by generating huge amounts of heat (like the sun), but by electrically exciting mercury atoms in the lamp which in term emits UV light. This is very energy efficient (compared to generating insane sun-like amounts of heat).\nConclusion - Can you get a Tan from a Space Heater? I’m sorry to disappoint you, but space heaters don’t get you tanned, because they don’t emit any UV light. A UV light is the only light that can tan you.\nInstead of looking for a heater that can tan you, you should rather look out for UV tanning lamps - the only devices that really work for indoor tanning.\nI hope I could help you out with this post! Feel free to share it with your friends, especially with those who use a space heater to get a tan - it doesn’t work!\nAttributions: title image by evil erin and tanned hand image by katiebordner\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-get-a-tan-from-a-space-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCan you get a tan from a space heater?

Can it dry the air? If your room is damp and you want to know whether you can get rid of the moisture by using a space heater, this is the right place.\nWe’ll cover everything you need to know to understand exactly how space heaters affect the humidity in your room.\nAfter reading this, you’ll know how to dehumidify your room, and, if you want, how to humidify your room with a space heater as well (you can actually do both if you know how).\nBut let’s take a look at how space heaters impact humidity first. Here’s the quick answer.\nQuestion: Will a space heater dehumidify a room?\nAnswer: No, space heaters don’t dry out and dehumidify the air in your room. However, the increase in temperature will cause the relative humidity to go down. The air just feels dryer, because it can absorb more moisture from your skin.\nLet me explain to you how space heaters impact the humidity in your room.\nHow Space Heaters impact moisture When you run a space heater on full power, you often feel like the air dries out. But why?\nI mean, this is a pretty interesting question. Here’s why:\nThink of a closed box (your room). Nothing can enter and leave this box. It’s sealed tight. The box contains just damp air and a space heater. Now let’s turn the heater on. What happens?\nThe temperature inside the box increases. But because nothing can pass through the walls of the box, the amount of moisture (water) stays the same. The water can not leave the box.\nWhen you run a space heater at home, it’s exactly the same thing. Your room is the closed box and your space heater heats the air. The amount of humidity stays the same because it can’t leave your room.\nLet’s note: The amount of humidity in your room (absolute humidity) is constant.\nFor some reason, when you run a space heater, the air does, in fact, feel dryer. This has to do with relative humidity.\nWhy space heaters seem to dehumidify the air in your room Now we know that space heaters actually don’t change the overall humidity in your room. As long as you keep your house closed, no air (or rather very little air) exchange takes place.\nMoisture doesn’t automatically vanish just because you’re using a space heater.\nHere’s why the air feels dryer in a heated room:\nEven though the absolute humidity stays the same when you use a heater, the relative humidity changes.\nLet me explain.\nHow space heaters lower relative humidity In contrast to absolute humidity, which measures how much water vapor is in the air, relative humidity measures how much water vapor is in the air relative to the temperature.\nThe reason is that warm air can actually hold much more water than cold air!\nWhen you heat your room with a space heater, the temperature increases, while the absolute humidity stays constant. This means that the relative humidity decreases.\nTherefore, a space heater reduces the relative humidity in your room.\nOkay: The absolute humidity stays the same, and the relative humidity decreases when you use a space heater. So, what?\nWe as humans can’t sense absolute humidity. We don’t have the capabilities to do so. The only type of humidity that matters for our well being is relative humidity. Relative humidity measures how much water is in the air compared to how much water it can potentially store.\nWhat is relative humidity? A relative humidity of 100% tells you that the air is completely filled with water. It can not store hold more. Whereas a relative humidity of 50% would tell you that the air currently only stores about 50% of what it potentially can.\nWe sense relative humidity like this:\nThe air that surrounds you always absorbs sweat and moisture from your skin. The higher the relative humidity is, the less water it can absorb (because it’s already saturated). In environments with high humidity, you will feel sweaty and uncomfortable. The air is damp and full of water.\nIn contrast, air with low relative humidity feels dry, because it wicks away moisture and sweat from your skin. Dry air is like a sponge that absorbs all the water it can find.\nAs already said, the warmer the air gets, the more water it can store. This way, space heaters lower relative humidity: They increase the amount of water the air can hold. The air just feels dryer.\nHow to control humidity with a space heater “A pleasant indoor climate is essential for a sense of well-being in the home. Room humidity can have a major impact on the quality of the living environment.”\nZehnderAmerica\nThe right level of humidity in a room is essential for feeling comfortable. If you know how, you can use space heaters to humidify and dehumidify a room as you please.\nIf you run a space heater alone, it can’t have an impact on the absolute humidity (the total amount of water in the air). But with air conditioning, you can help yourself.\nTrick your air conditioner with a space heater to dehumidify a room Generally, you can use air conditioners to dehumidify a room. However, you can improve the dehumidifying by using a space heater.\nAir conditioners suck the humidity out of a room. If you feel like your air conditioner doesn’t pull enough humidity and your room still feels damp, you can set the thermostat of your air conditioner lower and additionally turn on your space heater.\nThe space heater’s job is to heat the room. Meanwhile, the aircon tries the opposite: It tries to cool down the air.\nBecause the space heater is a heat source, the air conditioner won’t stop running because it attempts to cool down the space heater. As long as it’s running, it’s absorbing the moisture from the air.\nIn contrast, if you would use the air conditioner without a space heater, it would stop working right when it reaches the wanted temperature. With a space heater, the wanted temperature can not be reached and the AC keeps dehumidifying the air.\nNote: This dehumidifying method requires lots of power. I’d suggest not to run your space heater with the air conditioning on for more than half an hour at a time.\nHow to make a heated room less dry? On the other hand, you might wonder how you can humidify a heated room that feels dry.\nThis is actually straightforward.\nFirst method - Heating a water-filled baking tray Place a large cookie sheet, baking tray or similar in front of your heater. Your baking tray should have as much surface area as possible. Fill it with a thin layer of water and place it in front of your space heater. The water will evaporate and humidify the air in your room.\nSecond method - Using your shower This second method works incredibly fast. Within just a minute you will have a humidified room. Sadly, it does not always work because you need a bathroom next to the room you want to humidify.\nAnyways:\nTurn the shower on full heat for a minute. This will create lots of water vapor. You can then redirect the water vapor to your room using a fan or something similar.\nI found this works best if the bathroom is connected directly to the room you want to humidify.\nConclusion - Will a space heater dehumidify a room? A space heater will reduce the relative humidity in your room and make the air feel dryer. Although, the general amount of water in the air actually stays constant. Because the air is hotter than before, it can just suck up more moisture.\nYou can even use a space heater together with an air conditioner (I know this sounds counterintuitive) to increase the dehumidification rate. Additionally, this will even decrease the absolute humidity.\nI hope this article helped you in some way!

Here’s everything you need to know about powering space heaters with generators and what you need to consider to stay safe!\nAdditionally, we’ll cover whether it makes sense to use generators to power space heaters and I’ll show you some handy alternatives (that might work even better for your purposes).\nBut first, let’s take a look at the generators.\nQuestion: Can you run a space heater off a generator?\nAnswer: Yes, you can run a space heater off a generator. Most space heaters need 1500W of power. To stay safe, you should use a 2000W generator. Otherwise, you risk blowing fuses. Generally, running a space heater off a generator is energy inefficient though. We’ll cover what to do later on.\nBut first, let’s take a look at space heaters and generators.\nWhat size generator do you need to run a space heater? As already said in the quick answer, you can run space heaters safely using generators that deliver 2000W of power or more.\nBy having this 500W safety-buffer, you make sure that fluctuations in power don’t blow your fuse. Fluctuations could be caused by using an extension cord or changing the temperature settings on your heater’s thermostat.\nA 2000W generator generally has no problem running a 1500W space heater.\nBut that’s all it can handle!\nIf you want to use more devices with your generator, you should lower the heater settings to 750W or use a bigger generator.\nMost generators can’t handle a space heater and a fridge at the same time, for example when you’re in an RV. For such purposes, you need extra big generators.\nTherefore, you should first check what exactly you need to power with your generator.\nDo you only want to power a space heater? - 2000W are enough Do you need to run an entire living room or RV on one generator? - You should get bigger gear in the 5000W area. Here’s a video that shows what happens when you run a 1500W space heater off an 800W generator.\nA generator can never supply more than the wattage it declares. You can see that the voltage drops when the 1500 watts heating mode is activated. Most likely the heater will not work properly.\nTherefore, make sure you use a decent generator to run your space heater.\nRecommended Generator for running a space heater In case you don’t have a generator at home yet, here’s one we recommend that can easily run a space heater:\nWEN 56200i Super Quiet 2000-Watt Portable Inverter Generator (click here to check the price on amazon) Why this one? With 2000W power, it can handle all common 1500W space heaters, even the big oil-filled radiators. It actually is a clone of a Yamaha generator, however, it performs just the same for less than half the price. You can actually tell by the ratings on amazon.\nWill a 1000 watt generator run a space heater? Yes, a 1000 watt generator will only run space heaters up to 750 watts. Most space heaters run on 1500W but have a lower power 750W setting. You can use this low-power setting. However, with 750W you will not be able to heat big rooms, and you might only raise the temperature by a few degrees.\nIn general, use 1000W generators with space heaters only if you have no other choice.\nSafety tips for running a space heater off a generator “NEVER use portable generators indoors or in garages, basements or sheds – even if doors and windows are open. They should always be used outside, a good distance from windows, doors, vents or any other opening.”\nBonneville Power Administration\nIf you need to run your space heater indoors, I recommend placing your generator either in a well-ventilated room and powering your space heater from there. Or use an extension cord to run the generator outdoors while using your heater indoors.\nUse a thick, high-quality extension cord with your heater. Poor quality ones oftentimes caused fire accidents. Generally, you should never use an extension cord with a space heater when you plug it into your house power supply that is rated at 1500W. But running it with a 2000W generator is a little safer.\nHowever, never heat in your absence! Generators and heaters are both potentially dangerous devices. So, always use them when you’re there. Just to get rid of the little off-chance that something happens.\nUse a generator with 2000W or more. Never settle for less! Only the 2000W generators can safely handle space heaters. The more power your generator has, the smaller the chance of a fire or a blowing fuse gets.\nStart the generator before plugging in your space heater. Most space heaters have power settings, so when you plug yours in, increase the power one at a time until you arrive at 1500W. If your space heater has no settings, just skip this step.\nImage by Gavin St. Ours\nAlternatives to space heaters in a power outage Now you’re ready to power a space heater with a generator - but hold on! We’re not finished yet.\nMost 2000W generators only last for about 3-5 hours on full power(and space heaters require full power). Even if we reduce the space heater’s power to only 750W (low heat), most generators will only last for 6-8 hours. That’s not very durable.\nBut why?\nRunning a space heater off a generator is pretty inefficient. You lose power multiple times:\nYou lose power when converting fuel to electricity. And you lose power when converting electricity to heat. From a practical thinker’s perspective, this doesn’t make sense at all. Why don’t we just skip the electricity part and convert fuel to heat directly? This would increase the efficiency a lot. And it’s possible as well.\nHere is how you can apply “direct heating”: Heating without using electricity.\nCommon methods for fuel heating are furnaces or gas heaters. But we’ll focus on propane heaters now.\nPropane heaters are generally safe to run indoors. They don’t require any electricity and are way more efficient and inexpensive than using a generator to power an electric space heater.\nRecommended indoor propane heater Mr. Heater F274830 MH18BRV Big Buddy Grey Indoor-Safe Portable RV Propane Heater (click here to check the price on amazon) This heater is a much much better choice than first getting a generator and then powering a space heater with it.\nHere’s what a reviewer says who tested the heater with a 20lb propane tank:\n“Seems to last forever. The heater will run 1+ week in snow/ice weather if I\u0026rsquo;m careful and willing to layer up a bit indoors.”\nGenerator Reviewer\nBut remember: Even with an indoor propane heater you should play safe and air your room regularly. For additional safety, you can also install a carbon monoxide alarm in your house that will notify you when there’s too much CO in the air.\nWhere powering a space heater with a generator actually makes sense Powering a space heater with a generator could make sense in the following case.\nWarming pets’ room - When you’re warming a pets’ room (keep the generator outdoors!) space heaters (especially oil-filled radiators) are a safer choice than propane heaters. They don’t get too hot to the touch and are less hazardous. Space heaters also have automatic shut off and other safety features.\nI’ve already reviewed space heaters for birds. Take a look at that if you’re interested!\nConclusion - Running a space heater off a generator Yes, running a space heater off a generator is possible. 2000W (or above) generators are suited for handling the power a space heater requires.\nStill, a generator that powers a space heater is not the most efficient way to do it.\nInstead, you should look out for propane heaters (like the one we recommended). In most cases, the propane heater beats the space heater plus generator combo.\nIf you are curious about more home heating guides here’s our recommended next read: Infrared vs. Radiant Heaters: Are they the same?\nYou’ll learn quite some stuff about how these heaters work and in which cases you can use them!\nAttributions: title image by this flickr user\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-you-run-a-space-heater-off-a-generator/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou want to run a space heater off a generator?

This article contains everything you need to know to choose the right space heater for your bird as well as safety tips to make sure your bird stays happy.\nAfter reading this, you’ll know exactly which kind of space heater you should get for your bird and I’ve even included an easy-to-follow guide that shows you exactly what to do with a new heater to bird-safe it.\nBirds are really sensitive to heat and humidity. So, it’s great that you care enough for your pet to take the few extra steps and research before you buy a heater that could harm your bird.\nHere’s the quick general answer for you:\nQuestion: What space heaters are safe for birds?\nAnswer: Generally, oil-filled radiators are the best space heaters to use with birds. They don’t expose heating elements, are quiet and don’t light up. Additionally, they distribute the heat evenly and oftentimes come with a thermostat that regulates temperature. Also, oil-filled radiators don’t emit harmful gases after you’ve prepared them for your birds. Later on, I’ll show you how.\nFirst off: Never use a space heater with exposed heating elements. Exposed heating elements can easily hurt your bird. A heater with exposed heating elements is never bird-safe!\nWhy you should never use gas heaters for birds Birds are very sensitive to gases. As you might have already heard, back in the days coal-mine workers used birds to detect carbon monoxide. A dead bird was a sign of toxic gases and the workers knew to get out of the mine as quickly as possible.\nThat’s why you should never use gas heaters, propane heaters and kerosene heaters with birds.\nWhen burning their fuel, they produce an increased amount of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide - gases that are toxic and are dangerous for your bird.\nDon’t use a gas heater for your bird.\nElectric Space Heaters: Are they safe for birds? Generally, electric space heaters are a much better choice as a heater for your birds.\nThe reason is that they use electricity to produce heat instead of chemical reactions. With chemical reactions, you can never be totally sure. At least our human nose can’t smell most of the bad gases.\nStill, there’s one downside to electrical space heaters as well. It doesn’t apply to all of them, but some:\nThey have a nonstick coating that can emit gases. So, you either need to make sure you get a space heater without any coatings, or you get rid of the coating. You’ll learn more about this later on.\nHere’s what bird experts say:\nElectric space heaters are safe to use with birds, but according to the Bird Safety Corner\n“You should NEVER run a new electric space heater around birds unless you are certain it does not have a nonstick coating on it.“\nBird Safety Corner by cafabirdclub.org\nTo get rid of the coating, you could, for example, leave the heater running on full heat for a few weeks for a few hours a day. This will get rid of a big part of the coating.\nSome heater coils have a Teflon coating. This is, however, only dangerous if the heater gets too hot (just like with fry pans who shouldn’t overheat). A heater that doesn’t go over 400 degrees Fahrenheit should be safe even though it has a Teflon coating.\nBut: Some heaters use a so-called two-point controller. They are really cheap to produce because all they do is turn the heat on and off. These cheap on-off controllers could cause your space heater to get hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit and cause harmful gas emission.\nTry to avoid such space heaters.\nInstead, get a better-quality heater that has a built-in thermostat. Instead of switching full heat on and off, a thermostat balances the temperature evenly.\nWith a thermostat, the space heater is also less likely to overheat and much more energy-efficient. Such electric space heaters are safer to use.\nOkay, so here’s what we need to look out for now:\nNo coating (or burned off coating). Built-in thermostat. If you already have an old electric space heater somewhere in your house, you can assume that this one is safe to use. Old space heaters either don’t have a coating at all or the coating is already burned off.\nOil-filled heaters Oil-filled heaters oftentimes look like regular radiators. By heating the oil in its pipes, oil-filled radiators distribute heat evenly. Additionally, they have a big, wavy metal surface that distributes the heat.\nBecause of their shape, oil-filled heaters are not too hot to touch and they don’t emit gases.\nStill, if you get a new heater, run it a few hours, because the paint could store gas that you want to get rid of first.\nUnlike other heaters, oil-filled radiators don’t emit light. This means you can also use them at night without disturbing your bird’s sleep.\nOur recommendation: Oil-filled space heaters are the safest choice for birds Even though we have some more heaters to discuss, I’ll reveal our recommendation now.\nFor birds, oil-filled heaters are the best choice you can make.\nYou should get this heater for your bird:\nDeLonghi Oil-Filled Radiator Space Heater, Quiet 1500W (click here to check the price on amazon) Here’s why:\nOil-filled heaters don’t get too hot because their metal surface distributes the heat quickly. Still, they are able to evenly heat a room just like regular radiators.\nAdditionally, they are pet-safe and child-safe, because they don’t expose any heating elements. In contrast, other space heaters often have a protective metal grid that prevents you from touching the heating element. However, their protective metal grid gets really hot as well.\nIf you are concerned about your electric bill, you can stop worrying now: Even though they need 1.500 Watts of power like other heaters, they heat in a much more cost-effective way: More heat for less power.\nBecause oil-filled heaters are so massive, they retain their heat even when you shut them off. They don’t cool down instantly. That’s great if you want to keep your pet warm at night without leaving your heater running throughout the night.\nLike other heaters, oil-filled radiators often have a built-in thermostat, overheat protection and auto shut off.\nCeramic Heaters You can consider ceramic heaters as safe as well. They generate heat using a high-resistance ceramic heating element that can get really hot when electricity is applied to it. Metal parts then pull the heat out of the ceramic element and distribute it.\nBecause the main heating element consists of just ceramic, it emits very little or rather no gases at all.\nCeramic heaters don’t emit light, so it’s dark at night and your birds can rest.\nI’d only get ceramic heaters if your birds are in a cage. The heating element can get burning hot which could hurt them, so you should keep ceramic heaters in a safe distance from your birds.\nAlso, ceramic heaters produce a really dry heat which might not be the best for your birds feathers.\nWe’ll cover a little about humidifying later, so keep reading.ve\nInfrared Heaters Infrared heaters are generally safe as well. But similar to ceramic heaters, you should only use them when your birds are in a cage.\nBecause these heaters can get hot to touch, oil-filled heaters are better for free-flying birds.\nOne thing I like about infrared heaters for birds is that you can point them at the birdcage and they’ll only heat the cage area instead of the entire room. Because of that, infrared heaters are pretty cost-effective.\nSadly they don’t retain the heat for long: As soon as you switch them off, your bird’s cage will be cold.\nAdditionally, infrared heaters emit light, so it will not be dark at night.\nBut: Unlike other heaters, infrared heaters are quiet because they don’t need a fan running to distribute heat.\nWhat else to consider To make sure your birds are happy, here are some points you need to consider:\nAir the room regularly Vent the heating system (only needed for oil-filled radiators) regularly to minimize carbon monoxide emission and maximize heating efficiency Install carbon monoxide detectors just to make sure your heater is safe Keep your room humid. Birds are sensitive to dry air. Especially tropical birds need humidity. A simple thing you can do to fix this issue is to get a humidifier (like this one (click me) on amazon). Make sure no coatings like Teflon are used in your heater. How to bird-safe a new heater Brand new heaters are not fully ready for your bird yet. There are some things you need to do to bird-safe them.\nFirst, new heaters often have that “brand new electronics”-smell. If you recognize such a smell, your new bird heater needs some off-gassing first:\nTake your heater to the garage or to your garden and run it for on full heat for about 3 hours. Do that every day for one week. This makes sure that most of the unwanted gases evaporate.\nIf you are using a heater that is not oil-filled:\nPlace your heater in one corner of the room and let it heat the room. Keep your birds in a cage. If you see that the birds show interest in the new heater, distract them with their favorite toys or other things they like.\nYou need to minimize the birds’ interest in the new heater to make sure they don’t burn themselves when they’re out of the cage. That’s why oil-filled heaters are generally the best choice for birds: They don’t get dangerously hot.\nDon’t let your birds out until you think they’re used to the new heater in their room.\nCan you leave your bird space heater on when you’re not home? Generally, modern heaters don’t get hot enough to really damage something. They are equipped with auto-shutoff and overheating protection.\nStill, I believe it’s best to leave the house with a peaceful mind rather than worrying all day about accidents that might happen in your absence.\nTherefore, you should always shut off your heater when you’re not at home. Avoid the small chance that something goes wrong.\nThe Outline - What space heaters are safe for Birds? For birds, oil-filled heaters are the very best choice.

If there’s a difference: Which one is better? This is actually a topic that confuses lots of people.\nEven though I am an electrical engineer I was sitting in front of my screen thinking: “Is there even a difference between infrared and radiant heat”?\nIn this article, we’re going to uncover the truth that baffles even engineers. After reading this you’ll have a solid knowledge of what radiant and infrared heaters are and why they are called like this.\nBut first, here’s the quick answer.\nQuestion: Are infrared heaters the same as radiant heaters?\nAnswer: Absolutely. Infrared heaters and radiant heaters are the exact same thing. The word “radiant” indicates that the heat is generated with radiation, whereas “infrared” just specifies which kind of radiation is used. You could say “radiant heater” is a broader term, but in practical applications infrared is the only kind of radiation you use to heat your home. All infrared heaters are radiant heaters.\nSurprising? Well, it actually surprised me. I didn’t think that radiant heaters and infrared heaters are the same. I believe that you can easily confuse the term “radiant” with radiators, which don’t use radiation directly to produce their heat. That’s where the confusion oftentimes comes from.\nLet’s clarify a few things.\nWhy are they the same? Infrared heaters and radiant heaters are one and the same. The term “radiant heater” tells you that some kind of radiation is used to heat up a room. Whereas the name “infrared heater” specifies that infrared radiation generates the heat.\nGenerally, the radiation that we perceive as warmth is always infrared heat.\nThis means that radiant heat is just a broader term for infrared heat.\nAll heaters are radiant heaters (from a physicists perspective) In fact, all heaters are radiant heaters. Oil-filled space heaters and ceramic space heaters are radiant heaters as well. Why?\nEach object that has a temperature emits infrared radiation. When the infrared waves hit another object, the other object absorbs the radiation and heats up.\nOne good example are sun rays. Sun rays consist of many wavelengths including infrared. The infrared part of the spectrum is what warms you.\nSmall and interesting side note:\nSunlight contains a broader spectrum of wavelengths, ranging from infrared to ultraviolet (UV). The UV part gives you sunburn. That’s the reason you can’t get a sunburn from your space heater, radiator or in a sauna: The warmth there is pure infrared radiation.\nThe range of visible light: From UV (left) to infrared (right)\nThe warmth you perceive is always infrared radiation. It doesn’t matter where the heat comes from. Whether it’s from an infrared heater or a ceramic heater doesn’t matter.\nThink of it like this:\nImagine you point an infrared thermal camera (heat cam) at a ceramic heater. Would it light up? Yes, it would!\nBecause the heater is hot, it radiates infrared waves!\nBasically, infrared is just the same as heat (independent of the heat source).\nAdvantages of Infrared or Radiant Heaters Because infrared or radiant heaters use radiation instead of convection (the movement of air) to distribute heat, they come with some very useful advantages over regular heaters. Here are some of them:\nFocused heat- Infrared or radiant heaters don’t heat air, they heat objects. This means that infrared or radiant heaters can aim the radiation on any spot in your room that you like. You can use this focused heat area to keep a certain spot in one room warm and comfortable.\nThis is useful when you have a big room (a garage) and you want to be working just at your desk. With an infrared or radiant heater, you can aim the heater towards that desk to keep just this area warm.\nEnergy efficiency - Infrared and radiant heaters are energy efficient. The energy is bundled in infrared rays and reaches every spot you desire to heat. In contrast to regular space heaters, very little energy is wasted to heat unnecessary areas in your room.\nDurability - Infrared and radiant heaters don’t have any moving objects, which makes them very durable. There’s just nothin that can wear down.\nSilence- My favorite aspect of infrared heat is that it is silent. No fan is necessary to distribute the heat. Although some radiant heaters come with a fan, it is not necessary to use it. This makes it perfect for everyone who wants to concentrate or calm down.\nDesign- This is just my personal opinion, but I think radiant heaters look really really good. You can fit their design anywhere. It gives your room a bit of a manly vibe because you have these glowing orange-red radiator parts.\nDisadvantages of infrared and radiant heaters When you get an infrared or radiant heater there are some tradeoffs as well. They are not always suited for all purposes. This list helps you decide whether radiant heaters are something for you or whether you should keep looking.\nSome are not suited for heating big rooms- Some infrared and radiant heaters (usually the smaller ones) don’t distribute heat well. They are great for focused heat (for example keeping you warm on your couch) but perform not as great as other heaters when you want to heat an entire living room.\nIt makes sense to only get infrared or radiant heaters when you are sure you just want to keep a spot warm.\nAfter some time the temperature in a whole room will rise as well, but it’s not as fast as with other heaters.\n“Radiant heaters emit infrared radiation that directly heats objects and people within their line of sight, and are a more efficient choice when you will be in a room for only a few hours and can stay within the line of sight of the heater.” energy.gov about portable heaters\nNote: This downside is only valid for small infrared heaters. You can, of course find infrared heaters that are priced a little higher, which will heat up your room effectively (like the one I recommend in the section below). These heaters are usually bigger in size and cost a little more.\nHot to touch- Infrared and radiant heaters have a hot emission area where the infrared rays come out. This area is oftentimes hot to touch. Therefore, you should be careful with children and pets in that case.\nHowever, modern heaters usually have some kind of protection to minimize the risk of touching the hot metal grid. A lot of modern devices don’t even get hot on the outside at all. Which radiant or infrared heater should you get? Here’s my favorite infrared heater that comes without the disadvantages: It is not hot to touch and it is well suited for big rooms!\nPortable Infrared Heater by TaoTronics(click here to check the price on amazon)- A radiant heater with everything a good heater needs: Overheating protection so you can leave it on in your absence, tip-over-protection, built-in shutoff timer, suited for heating whole rooms.\n“Keeps my entire downstairs nice and toasty.”\na reviewer on amazon\nConclusion Infrared and radiant heaters are the same. Both use infrared radiation to heat up objects in your room.\nSmall radiant heaters are well suited for heating up limited areas while bigger heaters can heat up entire rooms. Consider this when buying an infrared heater.\nInfrared and radiant heaters are very energy-effective. They can directly heat objects within their line-of-sight and don’t need a fan to distribute the heat.\nAttributions: Title photo by i kwan (flickr)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/infrared-vs-radiant-heaters-are-they-the-same/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAre infrared heaters and radiant heaters the same or is there a difference?

Most extension cords can not handle the high currents space heaters draw. Especially small, low-quality extension cords can easily catch fire. However, if you absolutely need an extension cord, then you should get a heavy-duty cord.\n🔄 2025 Update: What’s New This Year? The risks of using the wrong extension cord with a space heater remain the same in 2025 — but more brands now offer modern space heaters with lower power settings (750W) and built-in safety features. If you\u0026rsquo;re using an extension cord, we strongly recommend:\nUsing only UL-listed, 12-gauge heavy-duty cords Limiting heater output to 750W or “Eco mode” Never leaving the heater unattended Also, new fire statistics show that over 80% of portable heater fires in homes are still caused by misuse of power strips or thin cords (source: [ NFPA, 2022]).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s first have a look at some cords that you can safely use with space heaters if you absolutely need to. After that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover why other (cheaply made) extension cords are not safe to use.\nSafe heavy-duty extension cords for space heaters If you absolutely need to use an extension cord with your space heater, for example, when you want to heat a room that has no access to electricity, then you should get a heavy-duty extension cord.\nThese cords are designed to handle the current that high-power devices draw.\nI recommend and trust this POWTECH heavy-duty extension cord (click here to see it on amazon).\nPlease note that it is only 25 feet long!\nIf you need any longer than that, I highly recommend this 100 ft Clear Power heavy-duty extension cord (click here to view it on amazon).\nBoth of these extension cords are safe to use as long as you connect them properly to the wall outlet.\nCan I use a Cheap Extension Cord with a Space Heater? In this section, we’ll take a look at all the downsides of running a space heater with an extension cord. Everything that we talk about from now on is about the cheaply made regular extension cords you get at Walmart or Home Depot.\n\u0026ldquo;You should never plug a heater into a power strip. These units are not designed to handle the high current flow needed for a space heater and can overheat or even catch fire due to the added energy flow.\u0026rdquo;\nUmatilla County Fire District #1 in Hermiston, Oregon\nHere’s some more explanation:\nExtension cords usually can’t handle high current Cheap extension cords are oftentimes designed to handle lower amounts of current.\nMedium-sized space heaters draw around 1,500 watts and 12.5 or more amps. That is what most extension cords can barely handle. The rating for your extension cord could be anything between 10-15A.\nIt’s like you’re walking on the edge of a cliff. Even slight fluctuations in power can cause your cable to burn.\nOn top of that, even if you have a cable rated at 15A, these high amounts of current can significantly heat the insulation and cause it to meld.\nMost extension cords are not suited for space heaters.\nSomeone can trip over the extension cord Having a long extension cord in your home also increases the chance of someone tripping over it.\nIf you have kids or pets at home, it is just a matter of time when someone trips over the cable.\nThis might not be harmful to the person tripping over (although it definitely could), but your space heater is likely to tip over.\nYour space heater is likely to fall over and cause damage When someone falls over the extension cord, your space heater could fall over.\nThis could cause damage by the impact of hitting the floor and might even burn or melt something.\nModern space heaters have tip-over protection that shuts off the heat when it tips over. However, as long as the heater hasn’t cooled down yet, it can still burn something.\nPay special attention to older heaters that don’t shut off. When they fall over on your carpet they can leave visible black burned stains that you can’t clean.\nCheap extension cords lower the efficiency When it comes to space heaters, efficiency is really important: You want to get the most heat for the least cost.\nHeaters rely on having a strong power source that supplies them with lots of energy. If you interpose a long extension cord between your space heater and your wall plug, you effectively increase the resistance for the flowing current.\nThe nature of our modern power supplies is that they increase the power as needed. When you plug in an extension cord, power supply essentially has to increase the power in order to reach the space heater.\nEven though this is just a tiny effect, extension cords might increase your electric bill in the long run.\nExtension cords increase currents When you use an extension cord, the resistance of it causes a voltage drop. This voltage drop is compensated by your power supply by delivering higher currents.\nRemember: Your space heater will draw 1500W, no matter what.\nPower equals voltage multiplied by current. This means that the current has to increase.\nThese higher currents can cause a fire! This is one of the main reasons you should never use extension cords.\nCan I use a Power Strip with a Space Heater? Similar to extension cords, you should not use power strips with a space heater except if you use a heavy-duty produc t. Cheaply made power strips can easily heat up so the material melts. They might even catch fire.\nPersonally, I recommend this heavy-duty power strip (click here to view it on amazon).\nThe downside of such a power strip, when compared to an extension cord, is that it is usually much shorter. The one I linked is just 15 feet, so I\u0026rsquo;d stick with heavy-duty extension cords.\nUsing cheap power strips can be even more dangerous than using a cheap extension cord in case you have more devices than just your space heater plugged in.\nThe more devices you run with the power strip, the more power is used. But a space heater already runs at the limit of what your power strip can deliver.\nThis means that the risk of a fuse melting or the cable overheating is even bigger than for regular extension cords.\nTips for using a space heater with an extension cord “Between 2011 and 2015, portable and stationary space heaters accounted for more than two of every five (43 percent) U.S. home heating fires and five out of six (85 percent) home heating fire deaths.”\nNational Fire Protection Association\nHalf of all home heating fires were caused by running heaters too close to other things such as furniture or clothing. So, pay attention to where you run your heater.\nIf you absolutely need to use an extension cord, here’s what you should do:\nUse a space heater that can switch between 750W and 1500W. Oftentimes, modern space heaters have the ability to limit their power usage.\nWith an extension cord, you should always run your space heater at 750W.\nLower power means the risk of damaging your power supply decreases. All regular extension cords can safely handle 750W.\nWhen you run your heater at 750W, the increase of current caused by the extension cord will not harm your cable because it’s still well within the boundaries.\nAlso, always use the space heater in your presence. This will avoid dangerous accidents that happened in the past, where people left their space heater unattended and lost their home due to a fire.\nHow to tell whether your extension cord is safe If you run your extension cord with too much power (e.g. a space heater that draws 1500 watts), here’s what usually happens:\nYour cable heats up. Generally, the thinner your cable is, the hotter it will become. The reason is that with a thin cable, the amount of “current per diameter” increases.\nPressing a lot of current through a thin cable causes a big number of electrons to bump into the metal atoms of your extension cord. The atoms will then start wiggling around which causes heat.\nSadly, lots of the extension cords that look thick aren’t suited for high-power applications. Some extension cord manufacturers just use a lot of insulation to make it look thick and save money with thin copper wires.\nA thick cable usually stays cool, because there’s more space for the current to travel.\nwarms up\nYour fuse melts or your safety switch is triggered. Obviously, if you draw too much power from your house’s power supply, the fuse will melt in order to protect your power supply from more damage.\nThe Outline: Can I use an Extension Cord with a Space Heater? You should only use heavy-duty extension cords with your space heater. The cheaply made extension cords Made-in-China are usually not trustworthy.\nFor example, a cheap extension cord will cause an increase in the current that your power supply has to deliver. That’s why cables can easily overheat and catch fire.\nAdditionally, people can fall over the cable and tip over the space heater. And on top of that, the efficiency of your space heater is lowered.\nHowever, if there’s no other option for you, you should definitely limit your space heater’s power demand to 750W or 1000W. Lots of modern space heaters have this capability.\nEven though heating your room will take a little longer, this is a much safer approach than running your heater at full power.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/can-i-use-an-extension-cord-with-a-space-heater/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e🆕 Updated April 17, 2025\u003c/strong\u003e - All recommended extension cords and power strips are up-to-date and safe for use with space heaters!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we’re going to cover exactly whether you can use an extension cord with your space heater and what you have to be cautious of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestion: Can I use an extension cord with a space heater?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnswer: \u003cstrong\u003eUsually, you should not use an extension cord with your space heater.
