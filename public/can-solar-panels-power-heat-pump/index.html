Additionally, you’ll get to know the cost of installing the solar panels as well as the heat pump.\nQuick answer: Yes, you need 17 solar panels to run an average 3-ton heat pump. Depending on the unit size and efficiency of your heat pump, you will need anywhere between 5 to 32 solar panels. Check the table below to see how many solar panels you need to run your heat pump.\nStick out! In this article, we’re going to cover\nHow we got to these results Tables with the exact number of solar panels you need to install to run your heat pump How much installing the solar panels and the heat pump will cost you So, let’s start!\nHow much Power does a Heat Pump consume? Heat pumps use anywhere between 545W and 4,286W of power depending on the unit size and SEER rating.\nSEER is the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating. It describes how many BTUs (British Thermal Units) you get per Watt of input power.\nDon’t worry, we’re not going into any calculations. Check the article on how to calculate heat pump power usage if you are interested in how to get to these results.\nYou can look up the SEER value of your heat pump in the specifications (a sticker somewhere on your heat pump, or just google it).\nIf you are too lazy to look up, then just assume your heat pump has a SEER of 16 or 18. That’s a reasonable assumption for most modern heat pumps.\nIn this article, I am going to hide the difficult stuff from you and just present you the numbers.\nTo find out how many solar panels you need to power a heat pump, we have to first find out how much electric energy a heat pump uses per year.\nHow much energy does a heat pump consume in a year? A heat pump runs an average of 5475 hours a year. Small and efficient units use 2,984kWh and large, inefficient units use up to 14,076kWh a year.\nThe energy consumption of your heat pump (moderately sized and medium efficiency) is likely somewhere in the middle, between 6,500kWh and 8,000kWh.\nDepending on your heat pump unit’s size and efficiency, this causes the following energy requirements:\nUnit size 14 SEER 16 SEER 18 SEER 20 SEER 22 SEER 1.0 tons 4,692 kWh 4,106 kWh 3,652 kWh 3,285 kWh 2,984 kWh 1.5 tons 7,041 kWh 6,159 kWh 5,475 kWh 4,928 kWh 4,479 kWh 2.0 tons 9,384 kWh 8,213 kWh 7,298 kWh 6,570 kWh 5,973 kWh 2.5 tons 11,733 kWh 10,266 kWh 9,127 kWh 8,213 kWh 7,468 kWh 3.0 tons 14,076 kWh 12,319 kWh 10,950 kWh 9,855 kWh 8,957 kWh 3.5 tons 16,425 kWh 14,372 kWh 12,773 kWh 11,498 kWh 10,452 kWh 4.0 tons 18,774 kWh 16,425 kWh 14,602 kWh 13,140 kWh 11,946 kWh 4.5 tons 21,117 kWh 18,478 kWh 16,425 kWh 14,783 kWh 13,441 kWh 5.0 tons 23,466 kWh 20,531 kWh 18,248 kWh 16,425 kWh 14,930 kWh How much Power do Solar Panels produce? Now we know how much energy a heat pump requires in a year. The only thing left to do is to find out how much energy an average solar panel produces in a given year.\nI’ve already crunched the numbers in this article: Can solar panels heat a house?\nHere’s the result:\nAn average solar panel generates 1.8kWh (Kilo-Watt hours) of energy per day. In 1 year, that’s 657kWh of electricity.\nHow many Solar Panels do you need to run a Heat Pump? Now that we know how much power a heat pump uses, and how much power an average solar panel generates, we can calculate the number of solar panels you are going to need to power your heat pump.\nThe table below lists the required number of solar panels for different unit sizes and SEER ratings:\nUnit size 14 SEER 16 SEER 18 SEER 20 SEER 22 SEER 1.0 tons 7 panels 6 panels 6 panels 5 panels 5 panels 1.5 tons 11 panels 9 panels 8 panels 8 panels 7 panels 2.0 tons 14 panels 13 panels 11 panels 10 panels 9 panels 2.5 tons 18 panels 16 panels 14 panels 13 panels 11 panels 3.0 tons 21 panels 19 panels 17 panels 15 panels 14 panels 3.5 tons 25 panels 22 panels 19 panels 18 panels 16 panels 4.0 tons 29 panels 25 panels 22 panels 20 panels 18 panels 4.5 tons 32 panels 28 panels 25 panels 23 panels 20 panels 5.0 tons 36 panels 31 panels 28 panels 25 panels 23 panels How much is the installation cost of solar panels for a heat pump? “The average total cost to install a residential system for solar panels before tax credits or rebates is comparable to the price tag on a new car.”\nconsumeraffairs.com\nMan, that’s a vague statement. Is it as expensive as a 10-year old used Toyota, or is it a new Benz? I hate meaningless statements. So, again, I crunched the numbers for you.\nThe installation cost of solar panels is between $2.20 and $2.80 per Watt.\nOne heat pump uses between 545W (22 SEER) and 857W (14 SEER) per ton.\nTo cover the cost of heat pumps, you will need to install between $1362.50 and $2142.5 worth of solar panels per ton of heating capacity.\nThis assumption leads to the following results:\nHeat pump size Minimum solar panel system cost Maximum solar panel system cost 1 ton $1,362.50 $2,142.50 2 tons $2,725.00 $4,285.00 3 tons $4,087.50 $6,427.50 4 tons $5,450.00 $8,570.00 5 tons $6,812.50 $10,712.50 Additionally, you can add 30-50% on top for the installation. The exact installation cost is hard to tell. You should get your phone and call 2-3 companies to get a quote! (Always tell them you’ve already called their competitors, and they are cheaper!)\nAnyways, installing solar panels is an expensive investment. Nevertheless, solar panels pay for themselves after 7 years. That’s a good return on investment here. After 7 years, you are profiting. I think it’s worth it.\nAre Solar Panels compatible with a Heat Pump? Yes, solar panels are compatible with a heat pump. Solar panels connect directly to your neighborhood’s electric grid and make use of net metering. Net metering is when you feed power into the electric grid and you are compensated for it on your electric bill.\nThis means the power you generate in the summertime when there’s lots of sunshine pays for your heating in the winter!\nIf you are using solar panels off-grid, you should get a large battery to store as much energy as possible.\nHowever, in this situation, I think solar panels and heat pumps are not the right way to heat. Rather you should stick to wood-burning stoves. Heating using a stove is objectively the most cost-effective way to heat a room (backed up by data).\nSolar Panels and Heat Pumps: Conclusion Combining a heat pump with solar panels is a great way to heat a house!\nEspecially since the heat pump acts as leverage (it has an efficiency bigger than one), meaning it moves more heat into your home than it consumes. This reduces the number of solar panels you are going to need to heat your home as compared to other heating methods that rely on electricity.\nYou had a great idea and you’ve got my approval!\n(Which is worth something, considering I am very critical when it comes to fancy heating methods)\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Solar panels can power a heat pump. Here’s how many solar panels you need to cover a heat pump’s power consumption. Additionally, you’ll get to know the cost of installing the solar panels as well as the heat pump.</p>
<p>Quick answer: <strong>Yes, you need 17 solar panels to run an average 3-ton heat pump. Depending on the unit size and efficiency of your heat pump, you will need anywhere between 5 to 32 solar panels. Check the table below to see how many solar panels you need to run your heat pump.</strong></p>
<p>Stick out! In this article, we’re going to cover</p>
<ul>
<li>How we got to these results</li>
<li>Tables with the exact number of solar panels you need to install to run <strong>your</strong> heat pump</li>
<li>How much installing the solar panels and the heat pump will <strong>cost</strong> you</li>
</ul>
<p>So, let’s start!</p>
<h2 id="how-much-power-does-a-heat-pump-consume">How much Power does a Heat Pump consume?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-much-power-does-a-heat-pump-consume">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Heat pumps use anywhere between 545W and 4,286W of power depending on the unit size and SEER rating.</strong></p>
<p>SEER is the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating. It describes how many BTUs (British Thermal Units) you get per Watt of input power.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, we’re not going into any calculations. Check the article on <a href="/how-much-power-does-a-heat-pump-use/">how to calculate heat pump power usage</a> if you are interested in how to get to these results.</p>
<p><strong>You can look up the SEER value of your heat pump in the specifications (a sticker somewhere on your heat pump, or just google it).</strong></p>
<p>If you are too lazy to look up, then just assume your heat pump has a SEER of 16 or 18. That’s a reasonable assumption for most modern heat pumps.</p>
<p>In this article, I am going to hide the difficult stuff from you and just present you the numbers.</p>
<p>To find out how many solar panels you need to power a heat pump, we have to first find out how much electric energy a heat pump uses per year.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-energy-does-a-heat-pump-consume-in-a-year">How much energy does a heat pump consume in a year?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-much-energy-does-a-heat-pump-consume-in-a-year">#</a></h2>
<p>A heat pump runs an average of 5475 hours a year. Small and efficient units use 2,984kWh and large, inefficient units use up to 14,076kWh a year.</p>
<p>The energy consumption of your heat pump (moderately sized and medium efficiency) is likely somewhere in the middle, between 6,500kWh and 8,000kWh.</p>
<p>Depending on your heat pump unit’s size and efficiency, this causes the following energy requirements:</p>

<p>Now we know how much energy a heat pump requires in a year. The only thing left to do is to find out how much energy an average solar panel produces in a given year.</p>
<p>I’ve already crunched the numbers in this article: <a href="/can-solar-panels-heat-a-house/">Can solar panels heat a house?</a></p>
<p>Here’s the result:</p>
<p><strong>An average solar panel generates 1.8kWh (Kilo-Watt hours) of energy per day. In 1 year, that’s 657kWh of electricity.</strong></p>

<p>Now that we know how much power a heat pump uses, and how much power an average solar panel generates, we can calculate the number of solar panels you are going to need to power your heat pump.</p>

<p>“The average total cost to install a residential system for solar panels before tax credits or rebates is comparable to the price tag on a new car.”</p>

<p>Man, that&rsquo;s a vague statement. Is it as expensive as a 10-year old used Toyota, or is it a new Benz? I hate meaningless statements. So, again, I crunched the numbers for you.</p>
<p>The installation cost of solar panels is between $2.20 and $2.80 per Watt.</p>
<p>One heat pump uses between 545W (22 SEER) and 857W (14 SEER) per ton.</p>
<p>To cover the cost of heat pumps, you will need to install between $1362.50 and $2142.5 worth of solar panels per ton of heating capacity.</p>
<p>This assumption leads to the following results:</p>

<p>Additionally, you can add 30-50% on top for the installation. The exact installation cost is hard to tell. You should get your phone and call 2-3 companies to get a quote! (Always tell them you’ve already called their competitors, and they are cheaper!)</p>
<p>Anyways, installing solar panels is an expensive investment. Nevertheless, solar panels pay for themselves after 7 years. That’s a good return on investment here. After 7 years, you are profiting. I think it’s worth it.</p>
<h2 id="are-solar-panels-compatible-with-a-heat-pump">Are Solar Panels compatible with a Heat Pump?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#are-solar-panels-compatible-with-a-heat-pump">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Yes, solar panels are compatible with a heat pump. Solar panels connect directly to your neighborhood&rsquo;s electric grid and make use of net metering. Net metering is when you feed power into the electric grid and you are compensated for it on your electric bill.</strong></p>
<p>This means the power you generate in the summertime when there’s lots of sunshine pays for your heating in the winter!</p>
<p>If you are using solar panels off-grid, you should get a large battery to store as much energy as possible.</p>
<p>However, in this situation, I think solar panels and heat pumps are not the right way to heat. Rather you should stick to wood-burning stoves. Heating using a stove is objectively the <a href="/how-to-heat-room-without-electricity/">most cost-effective way to heat a room</a> (backed up by data).</p>
<h2 id="solar-panels-and-heat-pumps-conclusion">Solar Panels and Heat Pumps: Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#solar-panels-and-heat-pumps-conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Combining a heat pump with solar panels is a great way to heat a house!</p>
<p>Especially since the heat pump acts as leverage (it has an efficiency bigger than one), meaning it moves more heat into your home than it consumes. This reduces the number of solar panels you are going to need to heat your home as compared to other heating methods that rely on electricity.</p>
<p>You had a great idea and you’ve got my approval!</p>
<p>(Which is worth something, considering I am very critical when it comes to fancy heating methods)</p>
