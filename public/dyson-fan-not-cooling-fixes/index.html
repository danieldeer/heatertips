After all, Dyson fans are not cheap.\nIn this article, we’re going to have a quick look at the 5 most common issues with a Dyson fan not cooling.\nQuick answer: A Dyson fan is usually not cooling because of blocked airways (air filter, air inlet holes). Also, check the set target temperature, and ensure your Dyson cooling fan does not run in backward airflow mode.\nUsually, the issues are relatively easy to fix. I will guide you through.\nBut first of all, one important note.\nDyson fans don’t cool by reducing the temperature A Dyson fan, regardless of whether you got a simple Dyson Cool (such as the AM07), or a Hot+Cool model, never cools.\nAt least not in a physical sense.\nDyson Cool fans can’t reduce your room’s temperature and blow cold air. They are simple fans.\nThe reason is that they don’t work like actual air conditioners, which have to be vented outside.\nInstead, Dyson Cool fans recirculate and distribute the air within your room. Because they don’t vent the heat outside, there is no way for the heat to leave.\nA Dyson cooling fan cools by carrying hot layers of air away from your skin. This creates a cooling effect but does not reduce room temperature.\nThis is a frequent misunderstanding.\nIf your Dyson creates a strong airflow, it is working perfectly fine.\nCauses and fixes for your Dyson fan not cooling If your Dyson fan, however, doesn’t blow air, there can be no cooling effect. Here are the most common causes and fixes:\n1. Clogged air filter The Dyson Pure Cool models have built-in filters. If the filter is clogged, it blocks proper airflow.\nHow to check: Turn off and unplug your Dyson fan. Remove the filter and run the fan.\nIf it blows cold air when running without a filter, then the clogged filter is the cause of the problem.\n“If your Dyson heater blows […] air when running it without a filter, you can tell for sure that the air filter is the cause of the problem.”\nDyson Hot+Cool repair guide\nHow to fix: Clean or replace the air filter.\nFor cleaning, refer to the user manual for specific instructions, which typically involve vacuuming the filter or washing it with water.\nAfter cleaning, ensure the filter is completely dry before placing it back into the fan.\nIf the filter is damaged or overly saturated with dirt and debris, it’s best to replace it with a new one.\nAlternatively, you can also simply run your Dyson without the air filter. This saves you a couple bucks in filter replacement costs.\nWithout a filter, Dyson cooling fans blow much more air, which creates a better cooling effect.\nBut beware: Running a Dyson fan without a filter voids the warranty. And, of course, without a filter, there is no air purification effect.\n2. Clogged air inlet holes In order for a Dyson cooling fan to blow out air, it first has to suck it in. All air passes the so-called air inlet holes (at the base of the fan).\nIf these are clogged, your Dyson fan can’t blow air.\nHow to check: Look at the air inlet holes and check if there are any visible obstructions or a buildup of dust.\nIf there are, this could be hindering airflow.\nHow to fix: Use a soft brush or vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to gently clean the inlet holes.\nMake sure the fan is turned off and unplugged while doing this.\nThese are the air inlet holes!\n3. Clogged internal parts The third (and last) place of dust accumulation is a Dyson fan’s internal parts. Over the months, a Dyson fan can accumulate a lot of dust on its inside.\nIf you’ve already checked the air filter and inlet holes and the fan is still not working, the issue might be with clogged internal parts.\nLet’s have a look at that.\nHow to check: Open your Dyson cooling fan’s case. The built-in electronics sit right between the air filter (at the bottom) and the fan (at the top).\nHow to fix: Use compressed air or a soft brush to clean the internal parts, ensuring you don’t damage any components.\nDon’t use water here! Water can damage the electronics.\nHere’s how much dust accumulates in a Dyson over time.\n4. Target temperature set too high (for Dyson Hot+Cool) For Dyson Hot+Cool models, there’s a thermostat that allows users to set a desired room temperature.\nIf your fan isn’t cooling, it may be because the target temperature is set higher than the room’s current temperature.\nHow to check: Check your Dyson fan’s temperature setting (if available). Not all Dyson fans have this. But Hot+Cool models usually have it.\nHow to fix: Set the lowest possible temperature and see if your Dyson fan blows cold air now.\nIf it works now, the temperature was merely set too high. You can adjust the temperature setting from here.\n5. Dyson set to backward airflow mode Dyson Pure Cool fans have a backward airflow mode. In backward airflow mode, the airflow is close to imperceptible, and as a result, it won’t blow any cold air.\nIn fact, the point of this mode is to have air purification without cooling.\nHere’s how Dyson describes backward airflow mode:\n“ Backward airflow mode. Purifies without cooling you. In backward airflow mode, the unique Dyson air valve projects air through the back of the machine, while maintaining effective purification.”\nDyson Pure Cool features page\nHow to check: For the Dyson Pure Cool and Dyson Humidiy+Cool models that have a backward airflow mode, the airflow will be directed away from you.\nThe air isn’t blowing toward you even when the fan is running.\nThe highlighted lower left button is the “backward airflow mode” button.\nHow to fix: Change the fan’s airflow direction mode using the remote control or the button on the fan, switching it from backward airflow mode to its regular mode.\nThis should allow the fan to blow air in your direction, giving the cooling effect.\nYour Dyson is still not cooling? If, after checking for all these potential issues, your Dyson fan is still not cooling, I recommend the following:\nCheck if you still have the 2 years warranty. Dyson might replace or repair your fan.\nAlternatively, instead of relying on Dyson for help, you can sell your broken Dyson cooling fan.\nThere are hundreds of electronics hobbyists online, looking for Dyson products with these exact problems to fix and flip them for a profit.\nThey’ll compete to win the bid and you’ll get a fair price, even though you sell the device as defective.\nMeanwhile, expecting money to come in soon, I recommend getting a new Dyson cooling fan, such as the Dyson Hot+Cool HP01 (click here to view it on amazon).\nConclusion Usually, fixing a Dyson fan not cooling is easy. Mostly, it’s just clogged airways, for example, a filter that needs replacement, clogged air inlet holes, or clogged internals.\nAlso, oftentimes, it’s just a wrong choice of settings. Dyson fans don’t blow cold air when their target temperature is set too high, or when you run them in backward mode.\n",

<p>If you&rsquo;ve already checked the air filter and inlet holes and the fan is still not working, the issue might be with clogged internal parts.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at that.</p>
<p><strong>How to check:</strong> Open your Dyson cooling fan’s case. The built-in electronics sit right between the air filter (at the bottom) and the fan (at the top).</p>
<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> Use compressed air or a soft brush to clean the internal parts, ensuring you don&rsquo;t damage any components.</p>
<p>Don’t use water here! Water can damage the electronics.</p>

<h3 id="4-target-temperature-set-too-high-for-dyson-hotcool">4. Target temperature set too high (for Dyson Hot+Cool)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-target-temperature-set-too-high-for-dyson-hotcool">#</a></h3>
<p>For Dyson Hot+Cool models, there&rsquo;s a thermostat that allows users to set a desired room temperature.</p>
<p>If your fan isn’t cooling, it may be because the target temperature is set higher than the room&rsquo;s current temperature.</p>
<p><strong>How to check:</strong> Check your Dyson fan’s temperature setting (if available). Not all Dyson fans have this. But Hot+Cool models usually have it.</p>
<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> Set the lowest possible temperature and see if your Dyson fan blows cold air now.</p>
<p>If it works now, the temperature was merely set too high. You can adjust the temperature setting from here.</p>
<h3 id="5-dyson-set-to-backward-airflow-mode">5. Dyson set to backward airflow mode<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-dyson-set-to-backward-airflow-mode">#</a></h3>
<p>Dyson Pure Cool fans have a backward airflow mode. In backward airflow mode, the airflow is close to imperceptible, and as a result, it won’t blow any cold air.</p>
<p>In fact, the point of this mode is to have air purification without cooling.</p>
<p>Here’s how Dyson describes backward airflow mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ <strong>Backward airflow mode. Purifies without cooling you.</strong> In backward airflow mode, the unique Dyson air valve projects air through the back of the machine, while maintaining effective purification.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dyson.com/air-treatment/air-purifiers/pure-cool/features">Dyson Pure Cool features page</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How to check:</strong> For the Dyson Pure Cool and Dyson Humidiy+Cool models that have a backward airflow mode, the airflow will be directed away from you.</p>
<p>The air isn&rsquo;t blowing toward you even when the fan is running.</p>
<p><img alt="dyson pure cool backwards airflow mode" loading="lazy" src="/img/dyson-pure-cool-backwards-airflow-mode.webp">The highlighted lower left button is the &ldquo;backward airflow mode&rdquo; button.</p>
<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> Change the fan&rsquo;s airflow direction mode using the remote control or the button on the fan, switching it from backward airflow mode to its regular mode.</p>
<p>This should allow the fan to blow air in your direction, giving the cooling effect.</p>
<h2 id="your-dyson-is-still-not-cooling">Your Dyson is still not cooling?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#your-dyson-is-still-not-cooling">#</a></h2>
<p>If, after checking for all these potential issues, your Dyson fan is still not cooling, I recommend the following:</p>
<p>Check if you still have the 2 years warranty. Dyson might replace or repair your fan.</p>
<p>Alternatively, instead of relying on Dyson for help, you can sell your broken Dyson cooling fan.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of electronics hobbyists online, looking for Dyson products with these exact problems to fix and flip them for a profit.</p>
<p>They’ll compete to win the bid and you’ll get a fair price, even though you sell the device as defective.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, expecting money to come in soon, I recommend getting a new Dyson cooling fan, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Purifier-Space-Heater-Silver/dp/B07KXBX32V?keywords=Dyson%2BPure%2BCool%2BLink%2BTP02%2BWi-Fi%2BEnabled%2BAir%2BPurifier%2C%2BWhite%2FSilver&amp;qid=1691660112&amp;sr=8-10&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;linkId=74d0cb530edbce3da35ea3edef20cc5c&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">the <strong>Dyson Hot+Cool HP01</strong> (click here to view it on amazon)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Usually, fixing a Dyson fan not cooling is easy. Mostly, it’s just clogged airways, for example, a filter that needs replacement, clogged air inlet holes, or clogged internals.</p>
<p>Also, oftentimes, it’s just a wrong choice of settings. Dyson fans don’t blow cold air when their target temperature is set too high, or when you run them in backward mode.</p>
