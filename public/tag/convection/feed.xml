      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do convection heaters work? In this article, we’ll take a look at that. After reading this short convection heater guide, you’ll understand how convection heaters work. In my explanations, I’ll stick to a very intuitive level. Let’s just avoid the detailed physics. We all had enough of it in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the short answer: &lt;strong&gt;Convection heaters work using a heating coil that produces hot air. The hot air is then distributed by a fan or by a large metal surface. Convection heaters use the air as a medium to transport the heat. Either they heat up air and then blow it across the room to distribute it. Or they make use of the natural rising of warm air, which ensures that the heat distributes itself. Keep reading to find out more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
