      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’re going to cover exactly whether you can use an extension cord with your space heater and what you have to be cautious of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick aswer: &lt;strong&gt;You should avoid using an extension cord with your space heater. But if you have to, use a heavy-duty extension cord. Also, if possible, operate your space heater at a low to moderate heat setting in order.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New fire statistics show that over 80% of portable heater fires in homes are still caused by misuse of power strips or thin cords (source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/research/nfpa-research/fire-statistical-reports/heating-equipment&#34;&gt;NFPA, 2022&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
