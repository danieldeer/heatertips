      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ðŸ†• Updated April 17, 2025&lt;/strong&gt; - All recommended extension cords and power strips are up-to-date and safe for use with space heaters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, weâ€™re going to cover exactly whether you can use an extension cord with your space heater and what you have to be cautious of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question: Can I use an extension cord with a space heater?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: &lt;strong&gt;Usually, you should not use an extension cord with your space heater. Most extension cords can not handle the high currents space heaters draw. Especially small, low-quality extension cords can easily catch fire. However, if you absolutely need an extension cord, then you should get a heavy-duty cord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
