      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am Daniel, an electrical engineer. For heatertips.com I research cost-effective heating and air conditioning methods, debunk myths, and explain what really works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging about home heating and air conditioning on this website since 2019 now. There have been many emotional ups and downs. Sustaining a website in the age of AI is certainly a challenge. But since writing became a daily habit for me, I view heatertips as a passion project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On HeaterTips, you get &lt;strong&gt;honest, cost-effective, and technically solid recommendations&lt;/strong&gt; on heating and cooling your home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Daniel. Everything you read on this page is backed by my &lt;strong&gt;own experiments&lt;/strong&gt; which I perform in my &lt;strong&gt;home lab&lt;/strong&gt;, studies, and my own experience using heaters, air conditioners, and air purifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t care about product brands, marketing, design, and all of that stuff. I just recommend what works and what is reasonable for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Best Torpedo Heater: Powerful and Reliable</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/recommended-products/torpedo-heater/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to buying a torpedo heater, you should get a suitable model right away. Usually, when you try to get a cheap torpedo heater, you are disappointed by what you receive. Therefore, I recommend getting a known and popular product right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what you use it for, whether it is for construction work, for keeping your garage warm, for a workshop… the right heater will support you at your work. A bad heater will only hinder you and produce unnecessary problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best Propane Heater: My Top Pick</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/recommended-products/propane-heater/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mr. Heater propane heater can produce heat equivalent to 3 average 1,500W space heaters and lasts up to 5 days on the lowest setting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either you pick cheap ones that will last for a few months until they break or you pick a good one right away that will last a lifetime. If you want to save money, you should be picking the one that lasts forever. Not only will it save you the stress to look for new propane heaters over and over, but you also feel much better, knowing you have a model that will reliably heat - even in emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Best Oil-Filled Radiator: My favorite!</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/recommended-products/oil-filled-radiator/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 18:26:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/recommended-products/oil-filled-radiator/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been recommending one oil-filled radiator model over and over on this website. I am just convinced that this one is by far the best value-for-money deal you can currently get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now hold on: I want you to pick the right oil heater right away. My buying philosophy is to look for items where you get your money’s worth. I want you to minimize the long term cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carless buying of heaters could lead to bad choices and buying the wrong products that don’t last long or don’t fulfill your needs. So, you would need to look out for heaters over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best Infrared Heater for your Home: My Top Pick</title>
      <link>https://heatertips.com/recommended-products/best-infrared-heater/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 18:23:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://heatertips.com/recommended-products/best-infrared-heater/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What’s the best infrared heater? I tried, tested and researched several infrared heaters and came to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to pick a model where you get the most out of your money. I don’t want you to waste time and energy on buying heaters that will last you only a few months or can’t deliver the heat you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s the short version: The best infrared heater in terms of quality, price, and reliability is by far the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Infrared-Heater-Portable-1500-Watt/dp/B002QZ11J6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=1Z796YYBSCYXT&amp;amp;keywords=dr+infrared+heater&amp;amp;qid=1578427646&amp;amp;sprefix=dr+infrare,aps,278&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;amp;linkId=e84d6163b83a30dbc5a70e5a5f4b38e0&amp;amp;language=en_US&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Infrared Heater Dr-968 (click to view it on amazon)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;. Among all infrared heaters, it is my favorite, because, in contrast to other models, it is able to keep the temperature of big rooms high, even when it’s the only heat source in your home in mid-winter. The Dr Infrared Heater is incredibly good to have for emergencies and whenever you need a reliable heat source. It comes with all the safety features you need and has a built-in thermostat (which is unusual for infrared heaters).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
