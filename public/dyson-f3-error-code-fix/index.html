For Dyson Humidifiers: On the Dyson Pure+Humidify models, the F3 error code means the device is too cold (under 5°C / 41°F).\nIn many cases, however, the F3 error appears at room temperature.\nAnd, unfortunately, Dyson themselves don’t provide any further information on what the F3 error is.\nFor Dyson Pure+Cool fans: The F3 error shows when your Dyson Pure+Cool fan is turned on and stops it from blowing air.\nOftentimes, people report the F3 error code right before or after filter replacement.\nThe F3 error code is not an issue with the fan, the filter, or a power issue. It can occur in Dyson Pure+Cool fans that are well-maintained.\nThe gist of it is:\nNobody knows exactly what causes the F3 error code on Dyson Pure+Cool models.\nHow to Reset the F3 Error Code There are two ways to reset the F3 error code, one with the remote, and one without it.\nBasic Reset: Press and hold the power button on the fan for about 10 seconds, or; Unplug the unit from the electrical outlet for around 15 seconds. If the F3 error persists, retry until it’s gone. Remote Reset: Hold down the power button and the volume up button on the remote control at the same time for approximately 30 seconds. Try both reset methods. Oftentimes, the basic reset doesn’t work, while the remote reset solves the issue!\nThese reset actions can potentially get the fan working again temporarily.\nHowever, the real bummer is, they don’t address the root cause of the issue, which means the error might reoccur.\nUnfortunately, the time at which the error appears again seems to be totally random. It might come back in a few minutes, or only in a few months.\nHow to Reduce the Risk of the F3 Error Code Returning? Possibly, the F3 error code was initially triggered by some internal issue in your Dyson fan. That could be a slight overheating, a slight surge in power, or internal friction increasing due to dust accumulation.\nIn any case: We don’t know exactly what causes the F3 error.\nBut you should still eliminate basic causes:\nInsert a new filter: Insert a new filter in your Dyson fan. If you already did that, there’s no reason to do it again. We just want to eliminate an old filter as a possible cause. Blow out dust: Disassemble your Dyson fan and blow out all the dust with a compressed air gun. Compressed air guns are critical for proper maintenance of a Dyson fan since they are the only way to get rid of all the dust and internal cloggings, without damaging sensitive electronics.\nI recommend this compressed air gun (click here to view it on amazon). Clean the fan blades: Usually, you can take the top part (the large circular fan) off your Dyson fan. It doesn’t contain any electronics.\nFor the top part disassembly, I found this video helpful.\nSo, you can blow strong compressed air through it to remove all the dust and any clogging.\nYou can even soak the entire top portion of a Dyson fan in water. Give it a thorough rinse. A clean Dyson fan with a new filter should have a reduced risk of getting new F3 errors. The F3 error can still return, but at least you rule out basic issues that stem from a lack of maintenance.\nSee how much dust accumulates inside a Dyson fan! This could be a cause of electronic issues. Disassemble your Dyson fan and clean it out.\nWhat to do about the F3 Error Code long term? Nobody knows why the F3 error occurs. We only know that you can reset the F3 error code as explained earlier, and that it will return after some time.\nOn some devices, it returns within a couple of minutes, while for others, the F3 will show only after a few months.\nSo, here’s my suggestion for the future:\nReset your Dyson Pure+Cool (or Humidify) model and find out how long it takes until the F3 code shows again.\nReset again.\nWatch the time again.\nIf the F3 error persists and comes back multiple times within a day, I recommend getting a new fan or humidifier.\nAnd:\nIt does not have to be a Dyson model! See here: Are Dyson Cooling Fans Worth It?\nRecommended Non-Dyson Air Purifier For the future, I’d advise you to not buy a Dyson fan. Not because they are particularly bad. But if one brand doesn’t work for you, you should not reward them by buying another model. If that new model ever shows the same error, you’ll be resentful.\nOne brand I find very reliable is Coway, which is one of Dyson’s best competitors.\nIn particular, I recommend a Coway Airmega air purifier.\nClick here to view the Coway Airmega 400 on Amazon.\nIt’s a flagship air purifier that comes with auto mode, air quality monitoring, and air filters with multiple filtration layers, just like a Dyson air purifier.\nHave a look at it and see if that’s something for you. If you’re looking for air purification only, I’d recommend a Coway over a Dyson anytime.\nConclusion To reset the F3 error code, hold the power button on your Dyson fan for 10 seconds. Turn your Dyson fan back on. If the issue persists, repeat. With this power-cycling approach, the issue goes away after some tries in most cases.\nI hope with this article, you were at least able to reset your F3 filter. The issue is an absolute riddle, since the solution seems to differ for many people.\nSo, I decided to open a comment section below this article! Please write about your situation, and how you managed to handle the F3 error.\nThis way we can build a knowledge base for this strange error code.\n",

<p>In many cases, however, the F3 error appears at room temperature.</p>
<p>And, unfortunately, Dyson themselves don’t provide <em>any</em> further information on what the F3 error is.</p>
<h3 id="for-dyson-purecool-fans">For Dyson Pure+Cool fans:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-dyson-purecool-fans">#</a></h3>
<p>The F3 error shows when your Dyson Pure+Cool fan is turned on and stops it from blowing air.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, people report the F3 error code right before or after filter replacement.</p>
<p>The F3 error code is <em>not</em> an issue with the fan, the filter, or a power issue. It can occur in Dyson Pure+Cool fans that are well-maintained.</p>
<p>The gist of it is:</p>
<p><strong>Nobody knows exactly what causes the F3 error code on Dyson Pure+Cool models.</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-to-reset-the-f3-error-code">How to Reset the F3 Error Code<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-reset-the-f3-error-code">#</a></h2>
<p>There are two ways to reset the F3 error code, one with the remote, and one without it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Basic Reset:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the power button on the fan for about 10 seconds, or;</li>
<li>Unplug the unit from the electrical outlet for around 15 seconds. If the F3 error persists, retry until it’s gone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Remote Reset:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hold down the power button and the volume up button on the remote control at the same time for approximately 30 seconds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Try both reset methods. Oftentimes, the basic reset doesn’t work, while the remote reset solves the issue!</strong></p>
<p>These reset actions can potentially get the fan working again temporarily.</p>
<p>However, the real bummer is, they don’t address the root cause of the issue, which means the error might reoccur.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the time at which the error appears again seems to be totally random. It might come back in a few minutes, or only in a few months.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-reduce-the-risk-of-the-f3-error-code-returning">How to Reduce the Risk of the F3 Error Code Returning?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-reduce-the-risk-of-the-f3-error-code-returning">#</a></h2>
<p>Possibly, the F3 error code was initially triggered by some internal issue in your Dyson fan. That could be a slight overheating, a slight surge in power, or internal friction increasing due to dust accumulation.</p>
<p>In any case: We don’t know exactly what causes the F3 error.</p>
<p>But you should still eliminate basic causes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insert a new filter:</strong> Insert a new filter in your Dyson fan. If you already did that, there’s no reason to do it again. We just want to eliminate an old filter as a possible cause.</li>
<li><strong>Blow out dust:</strong> Disassemble your Dyson fan and blow out all the dust with a compressed air gun. Compressed air guns are critical for proper maintenance of a Dyson fan since they are the only way to get rid of all the dust and internal cloggings, without damaging sensitive electronics.<br>
I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Compressed-air-dusters-electric-duster-100000RPM-air-Blower-Computer-Compressed/dp/B0BDKT7YHB?crid=2AW7JD60CZ7BO&amp;keywords=compressed+air+gun&amp;qid=1696058942&amp;sprefix=compressed+air+gun%2Caps%2C175&amp;sr=8-3&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;linkId=483d28ae01e41e36d6c370567c100f3b&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">this compressed air gun (click here to view it on amazon)</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Clean the fan blades:</strong> Usually, you can take the top part (the large circular fan) off your Dyson fan. It doesn’t contain any electronics.<br>
For the top part disassembly, I found this video helpful.<br>
So, you can blow strong compressed air through it to remove all the dust and any clogging.<br>
You can even soak the entire top portion of a Dyson fan in water. Give it a thorough rinse.</li>
</ul>
<p>A clean Dyson fan with a new filter should have a reduced risk of getting new F3 errors. The F3 error can still return, but at least you rule out basic issues that stem from a lack of maintenance.</p>
<p><img alt="dyson hot cool dust in internal components" loading="lazy" src="/img/dyson-hot-cool-heater-dust-internal-components.webp">See how much dust accumulates inside a Dyson fan! This could be a cause of electronic issues. Disassemble your Dyson fan and clean it out.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-about-the-f3-error-code-long-term">What to do about the F3 Error Code long term?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-to-do-about-the-f3-error-code-long-term">#</a></h2>
<p>Nobody knows why the F3 error occurs. We only know that you can reset the F3 error code as explained earlier, and that it will return after some time.</p>
<p>On some devices, it returns within a couple of minutes, while for others, the F3 will show only after a few months.</p>
<p>So, here’s my suggestion for the future:</p>
<p>Reset your Dyson Pure+Cool (or Humidify) model and find out how long it takes until the F3 code shows again.</p>
<p>Reset again.</p>
<p>Watch the time again.</p>
<p><strong>If the F3 error persists and comes back multiple times within a day, I recommend getting a new fan or humidifier.</strong></p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>It does not have to be a Dyson model! See here: <a href="/are-dyson-cooling-fans-worth-it/">Are Dyson Cooling Fans Worth It?</a></p>
<h3 id="recommended-non-dyson-air-purifier">Recommended Non-Dyson Air Purifier<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recommended-non-dyson-air-purifier">#</a></h3>
<p>For the future, I’d advise you to not buy a Dyson fan. Not because they are particularly bad. But if one brand doesn’t work for you, you should not reward them by buying another model. If that new model ever shows the same error, you’ll be resentful.</p>
<p>One brand I find <em>very</em> reliable is Coway, which is one of Dyson’s best competitors.</p>
<p>In particular, I recommend a Coway Airmega air purifier.</p>
<p>Click here to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coway-Airmega-Purifier-sq-ft-White/dp/B01C9RIACG?crid=LG42Q8TZ9UEP&amp;keywords=coway%2Bair%2Bpurifiers&amp;qid=1696059838&amp;sprefix=coway%2B%2Caps%2C272&amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=heatertips-20&amp;linkId=9507ea43b0c6ce583dec1ba74c081526&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">view the Coway Airmega 400 on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a flagship air purifier that comes with auto mode, air quality monitoring, and air filters with multiple filtration layers, just like a Dyson air purifier.</p>
<p>Have a look at it and see if that’s something for you. If you’re looking for air purification only, I’d recommend a Coway over a Dyson anytime.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>To reset the F3 error code, hold the power button on your Dyson fan for 10 seconds. Turn your Dyson fan back on. If the issue persists, repeat. With this power-cycling approach, the issue goes away after some tries in most cases.</strong></p>
<p>I hope with this article, you were at least able to reset your F3 filter. The issue is an absolute riddle, since the solution seems to differ for many people.</p>
<p>So, I decided to open a comment section below this article! Please write about your situation, and how you managed to handle the F3 error.</p>
<p>This way we can build a knowledge base for this strange error code.</p>
