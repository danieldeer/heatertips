  "articleBody": "There are clear differences between an infrared vs oil heater. But they are actually very simple to understand. In this article, I’m going to show you 21 pros and cons of using an infrared vs oil heater, so you know which one suits you best.\nThe difference between infrared heaters and oil heaters is that infrared heaters are designed for quick, directional heat and better efficiency, whereas oil heaters are meant to replace your home heating unit by heating whole rooms evenly and with more strength.\nIn order to learn more about the exact differences between infrared and oil heaters, let’s take a look at all the pros and cons.\n1. Weight Oil Heater Pro: Heavier because of a solid, durable metal body.\nCon: Heavier, less portable.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Light, easy to carry around.\nCon: Big infrared heaters can be heavy as well.\nGenerally, oil heaters are heavier than infrared heaters because of their large oil-filled metal body. Infrared heaters are lighter because they are often built with lighter materials, such as plastic or thin metal.\nAlso, the heating elements of an infrared heater weigh next to nothing. They are light infrared tubes.\nBut there are exceptions: There are some big infrared heaters that can get heavy as well. In the upper price range, where you get big heaters, infrared heaters can become as heavy as oil heaters. So, the weight of an infrared heater and an oil heater depends from model to model.\nMost oil heaters weigh around 25 pounds, whereas most infrared heaters weigh only 10 pounds. However, you can find lighter (mini) oil heaters and bigger infrared heaters which weigh 25 pounds as well.\n2. Size Oil Heater Pro: Big, but compact (not unnecessarily big)\nCon: Sometimes too big.\nInfrared Heater Pro: From small to big - you can find all sizes.\nYou can get infrared heaters in absolutely every size. From very small desk heaters you can use in your office, to really big and powerful heaters that are able to heat whole apartments.\nThe size of an infrared heater is not limited. It’s simple for the manufacturers to change the size of the infrared heating element.\nIn contrast, oil heaters can not get arbitrarily large. Too big models would be too heavy to handle. That’s why you mostly find oil heaters in similar sizes. They are compact and size-efficient. Oil heaters appear big at first. But they need a good size to distribute the heat evenly.\nUsually, oil heaters are one-size-fits-all. Of course, there are some exceptions. You can, for example, find mini oil heaters or oil heaters with very thin heating bodies. By using these you sacrifice heating capacity though.\n3. Heating Speed Oil Heater Con: Slow heating speed.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Fast heating speed. Reaches full heat within a minute.\nHeating speed is mainly determined by the technology that’s used in a heater.\nThe heating speed is one of the fundamental differences between an infrared vs oil heater. And it’s one of the key differences you need to decide which model suits you best.\nDo you need a fast heater or a slow and steady model?\nInfrared heaters are extremely fast. They are the racing cars among heaters.\nIt takes an infrared heater just a minute to get to full heat. As soon as you turn an infrared heater on, you can feel the heat coming out.\nThey are a great solution if you’re freezing and you want to warm up immediately.\nOil heaters need more time. They are the snails among heaters. It takes them several minutes to get warm. The reason is that the metal body contains lots of oil to distribute the heat.\nBefore any heat reaches you, the heater has to warm up the oil first. That’s what takes time.\nBecause of that, oil heaters are good for longer heating periods, for example, keeping a living room warm throughout the evening.\n4. Efficiency Oil Heater Pro: Efficient heating of large rooms.\nCon: Not efficient outdoors.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Efficient heating in small rooms.\nCon: Not efficient heating large rooms.\nBoth heaters, infrared and oil heaters are efficient in their own ways. You just have to know what you want to use them for. Each of them is best in certain applications.\nInfrared heaters produce directional heat (radiation) that heats just space in front of the space heater. That’s why infrared heaters are 40% more efficient than other heaters.\nIt’s because you can focus the heat in one direction. For that reason, infrared heaters are good at heating single persons.\nYou can point the heater at them. But whole rooms are hard to heat using infrared because the infrared rays usually don’t cover the whole room.\nHere’s a guide on the best infrared heater placements within a room to maximize efficiency (something you can’t do with oil-filled radiators).\nIn contrast, oil heaters distribute the heat more evenly. They produce warm air that distributes everywhere in a room. Because of that, oil heaters are better at heating bigger rooms.\nHowever, oil heaters can’t heat outdoors at all. The wind immediately blows the warm air away, whereas the directional heat of infrared heaters withstands the wind. You can’t blow away radiation.\n5. Price Oil Heater Pro: Price-effective.\nCon: Few models in lower price categories.\nInfrared Heater Pro: More heaters in lower price categories.\nOil heaters and infrared heaters both are available in very similar price ranges. You can find most models between $50 and $200.\nHowever, in the lower price range, you can find more infrared heaters. I guess the reason is that they are easier to produce overseas and import than heavy oil heaters. That’s why there are a lot of cheap infrared heaters: They are easier to ship.\nStill, you can find oil heaters for cheap and infrared heaters that are expensive. There are no real limitations for the price you pay.\nHowever, remember that an oil heater is better in heating large spaces. This means that for the same price, you can heat more space. Meanwhile, infrared heaters are more efficient in the long run. The long-term cost to run an infrared heater is usually lower.\n6. Safety Oil Heater Pro: Very safe. Also safe to touch.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Very safe.\nCon: Not safe to touch.\nOil heaters and infrared heaters both come with a vast amount of safety features. From safety certifications to overheat protection, automatic shut-off, tip-over protection, and everything you wish to feel safe.\nHowever, there’s one small difference that makes oil heaters safer by a small margin.\nInfrared heaters emit heat through a focused area where the heat comes out. This area is usually protected by a metal grid, so you can not put your hand inside. Even though the metal grid is a safety measure, it heats up as well and becomes hot to the touch. I tried it myself and burned my fingers.\nIn contrast, oil heaters distribute their heat over a large surface. This way the heat is spread evenly instead of being focused. That’s why oil heaters are usually safe to touch and don’t get burning hot.\n7. Portability Oil Heater Pro: Rollers increase portability.\nCon: Still rather hard to transport compared to other heaters.\nInfrared Heater Pro: High portability, easy to transport.\nWhen you want to move your space heater to another room, portability becomes important.\nBecause of the lower weight, infrared heaters win this point. They are easy to lift and light. Usually, they are already handy to carry or they have a built-in handle to carry them easily.\nOn the other hand, oil heaters also try to do the best they can. Oftentimes they come with rollers, so you can easily move them around. However, oil heaters become really hard to transport when you have to move them upstairs. The rollers are only useful as long as the heater stays on the same floor.\n8. Heating Capacity Oil Heater Pro: Very high heating capacity. Stores and produces lots of heat.\nInfrared Heater Con: Low heating capacity. The heat immediately disappears after turning it off.\nHeating capacity is the amount of heat that the heater stores and emits over time. More heating capacity means more heat and more heating strength.\nInfrared heaters have absolutely no heating capacity. Once you turn an infrared heater off, the heat vanishes immediately. It doesn’t store any heat.\nMeanwhile, oil heaters have a high heating capacity. Even after turning them off, the oil remains how and continues to deliver heat until it cools down. It’s similar to how a hot water bottle works.\nThat’s why oil heaters can heat more evenly and are better in delivering heat over longer periods of time.\n9. Versatility Oil Heater Con: Low versatility. Only useful in closed rooms.\nInfrared Heater Con: High versatility. Useful in many locations.\nOil heaters are best for heating closed rooms. Especially indoor home heating is what they are made for. But they can also keep small wood workshops warm. The issue with oil heaters is that they attempt to heat the air of the room. That’s why they are not useful (compared to infrared heaters) in heating uninsulated rooms. You also can’t use them outdoors at all.\nInfrared heaters are much more versatile. They can heat indoors, in garages, uninsulated rooms, attics and even outdoors. Basically, you can use them wherever you want. The reason is that infrared heat is such a special type of heat that keeps you warm even when the air around you is cold. It’s similar to how sun rays feel in wintertime.\n10. Maintenance Oil Heater Pro: No regular maintenance.\nCon: Hard to fix in case it breaks.\nInfrared Heater Pro: No maintenance. Easier to fix.\nAs long as you’re not an electrician, you shouldn’t do any maintenance jobs on your heater. Still, this point is important in case your heater breaks.\nIt’s possible to let an electrician fix your heater. So here’s the maintenance difference between an infrared vs oil heater.\nInfrared heaters are generally simpler types of heaters you can easily understand. They consist of a power conversion stage and a heating stage. It’s not a big deal for someone who likes electronics to locate the issue.\nOil heaters are a little more complex. They have a similar power conversion and heating stage. However, the heating element is embodied in the metal body and is very hard to fix.\nWhen an oil heater breaks, chances are, you better buy a new one.\nStill, both heaters are maintenance-free and you don’t need to check them regularly.\n11. Design Oil Heater Con: Oil heaters all look about the same. Good designs are rare.\nInfrared Heater Pro: All designs you wish for.\nOil heaters look like typical heaters. And they all look about the same. They have a thermostat attached to a metal body. That’s it. There’s no fancy design and finding a good looking one is hard. Oil heaters are hard to fit in a stylish apartment. At least, you’ll have to spend time looking for a good looking model that suits your purposes.\nMeanwhile, infrared heaters are available in all sizes, shapes, and designs. From what I have seen, you can find models that fit every style you want. The design point goes to infrared heaters.\n12. Comfort Oil Heater Pro: Oil heaters produce even heat.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Dry heat that feels like sunlight.\nWhen you use a space heater all day long, it’s important that the heat it produces feels good and you are comfortable with it.\nMy impression is that infrared heat feels like sunlight. Also, it’s very similar to the heat of a fireplace. It’s very focused heat and it feels like it dries your skin. You might now that dry-skin feeling when you’re sitting at a campfire. Here’s an article on 3 Heaters that don’t dry the air!\nWhen I have my infrared heater next to me while I’m working, it heats only one side of my body, which I don’t really like.\nMeanwhile, oil heaters produce heat that feels much better. The heat does not rely on radiation, but it warms the air, which feels more comfortable. Also, oil heaters heat a room evenly.\n13. Storage Oil Heater Con: Storable, but hard to fit in a small storage room.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Easy to store.\nDuring summertime, you don’t always want to keep your heater in your room. So you need to store it.\nBut which one fits better in a storage room? Infrared vs oil heater?\nBoth heaters are definitely easy to fit in a storage room. Usually, oil heaters are a little bigger and cumbersome which makes them a little harder to store in small rooms. Also, they are very heavy, so you can’t really put them on a shelve.\nInfrared heaters are easy to store. They are smaller and lighter, so you can easily put them wherever you want. And you can take them out easily at any time.\n14. Availability Oil Heater Pro: Available everywhere.\nCon: Hard to find in small local shops.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Available everywhere.\nYou can easily find both heater types online. There’s no difference in availability between an infrared vs oil heater.\nHowever, in local shops, infrared heaters are more present - at least where I live. The reason is probably that they are cheaper, easier to sell and more portable. People would hate buying an oil heater off the shelve and carry it home.\nYou can find both heater types used online. So, you can get even better bargains.\n15. Overnight Use Oil Heater Pro: Safe to run overnight.\nInfrared Heater Con: Emits light which disrupts sleep.\nWhen you use a space heater overnight, what you’re looking for is even and long-lasting heat. Which already gives you a hint on which heater is the better choice.\nAlso, you want it to have sufficient power, even on lower settings and enough safety features.\nImportant note: Only use a heater overnight, when you’re at home.\nInfrared heaters are not suitable for overnight heating. Even if they provide enough heat and come with all the safety features you need. The heating elements of an infrared heater glow red which definitely hinders your sleep.\nIn contrast, oil heaters don’t emit any light and are better suited for heating a room overnight. Check out this article for the 3 Best Oil Heaters to run overnight!\nBoth heaters, infrared and oil heaters are silent at night.\n16. Noise Oil Heater Pro: Very silent.\nCon: Can occasionally make a clicking noise (during heat-up and cool-down).\nInfrared Heater Pro: Silent.\nCon: Makes clicking noise as well.\nBoth heaters are silent as long as you don’t buy special models with a built-in fan. Usually, you can check that in the product description.\nWhen an infrared vs oil heater heats up or cools down, they both can sometimes make clicking noises because of the expanding and contracting surface material. Due to the heat, the material moves a little and makes a little noise when it releases tension. That’s normal and you cannot avoid it.\nHowever, these clicking noises are very rare.\nIt’s also possible that a transformer hums (very) silently or that the infrared tubes hum.\nGenerally, both types of heaters are comparably silent and you can run them while doing concentrated work or while sleeping.\n17. Children \u0026 Pets Oil Heater Pro: Child and pet safe.\nInfrared Heater Con: Oftentimes hot to touch.\nIf you have children or pets at home, you want to make sure, that nobody gets injured. So, what’s the better child- and pet safe heater? Infrared or oil?\nBecause infrared heaters have an opening where all the heat comes out, they are usually hot to touch in that area. The opening is usually protected by a metal grid, so you can’t put your hand inside and touch the heating element directly. However, this metal grid gets hot too.\nOil heaters, on the other hand, have a big surface and the heating element is embodied in oil. So, there are no hot to touch spots. Oil heaters get hot, but not hot enough to be dangerous.\nImage by Mark Turnauckas\n18. Outdoor Use Oil Heater Con: Not useful outdoors.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Can be used outdoors.\nWhich heater is best for your next outdoor garden party? Which one should you set up in your party tent next summer?\nBecause infrared radiation heats objects and not air, you can feel the heat even when you are outdoors. That’s why infrared is good for garden parties or garage heating. Also, the heat is directional, which is very handy at parties. Guests who feel cold can stand next to the heater. Others can spend their time elsewhere.\n“Outdoor infrared heaters warm up specific areas and objects rather than the air, you don’t waste energy and save money on your utility bills” infraredheatersdirect.co.uk\nOil heaters are not effective to run outdoors, because they try to heat the air. Outdoors, the wind would blow away any heat. Oil heaters are a waste of energy when you run them outdoors.\n19. Thermostat Oil Heater Pro: Better thermostats.\nInfrared Heater Con: Usually not as good as oil heaters.\nGenerally, temperature control is working fine with both space heaters. For most infrared vs oil heater, you can find the temperature controls in two different designs.\nEither it’s a simple power switch where you can set the power you want (usually 750W or 1500W). Or it’s a more advanced thermostat where you can set the exact temperature you want.\nFrom an engineer’s perspective, it’s easier to control the temperature of an oil heater because it heats the air that surrounds it. So, the thermostat measures the current temperature, then compares it to the one you set and makes automatic corrections.\nWith infrared heaters, that’s more difficult because the infrared rays are harder to measure.\nThat’s why most (but not all) infrared heaters come with simple power switches and oil heaters have a thermostat.\nBut you can find both types of controls for both heaters.\n20. Stability Oil Heater Pro: Very stable. Built with solid and heavy materials.\nInfrared Heater Con: Usually rather fragile.\nOil heaters are more stable than infrared heaters because of their heavy metal body that encases the oil. It’s their design that makes them stable. Oil heaters have to withstand changes in pressure (because the oil heats up) and therefore they have to be reliable.\nInfrared heaters are often cheaper and less stable. With a plastic surface and parts that are not as solid as they should be. But when you think about it, infrared heaters don’t really need to be stable at all. All they do is emit heat. They don’t carry a huge load of oil compared to oil heaters.\nThat’s why oil heaters are more stable than infrared heaters.\n21. Durability Oil Heater Pro: Very durable. Lasts up to decades.\nInfrared Heater Pro: Durable, but a little less than oil heaters.\nBoth heaters have no moving parts. So, they can’t wear down. This makes both heater types (infrared vs oil heater) very durable.\nHowever, I always see tons of used oil heaters for sale online (on eBay or craigslist) that people found in their garages. They seem to last for decades.\nInfrared heaters usually consist of less durable materials, which is why they don’t last as long as oil heaters.\nCompared to other types of heaters (ceramic for example), both infrared and oil heaters are very durable.\nInfrared vs Oil Heater - Which to Choose? Answer: Infrared heaters are better for you if you want quick heating on all occasions and you want to be versatile with your heater. On the other hand, oil heaters are the better choice to replace a heating system and reliably heat a large room long-term.\nWhich one do you prefer?\nYou can easily find out which type of heater you need by creating a checklist for each of the points in this article.\nWrite down a plus and a minus for each point you like and don’t like. Then, you can count the score (add plusses, subtract minuses) and find out which one scores better for you personally.\nAttributions: Title image - Pelonis Oil-filled Heater \u0026 Air Choice Infrared Heater\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>There are clear differences between an infrared vs oil heater. But they are actually very simple to understand. In this article, I’m going to show you 21 pros and cons of using an infrared vs oil heater, so you know which one suits you best.</p>
<p><strong>The difference between infrared heaters and oil heaters is that infrared heaters are designed for quick, directional heat and better efficiency, whereas oil heaters are meant to replace your home heating unit by heating whole rooms evenly and with more strength.</strong></p>
<p>In order to learn more about the exact differences between infrared and oil heaters, let’s take a look at all the pros and cons.</p>
<h2 id="1-weight">1. Weight<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-weight">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Heavier because of a solid, durable metal body.</p>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Heavier, less portable.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Light, easy to carry around.</p>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Big infrared heaters can be heavy as well.</p>
<p>Generally, oil heaters are heavier than infrared heaters because of their large oil-filled metal body. Infrared heaters are lighter because they are often built with lighter materials, such as plastic or thin metal.</p>
<p>Also, the heating elements of an infrared heater weigh next to nothing. They are light infrared tubes.</p>
<p>But there are exceptions: There are some big infrared heaters that can get heavy as well. In the upper price range, where you get big heaters, infrared heaters can become as heavy as oil heaters. So, the weight of an infrared heater and an oil heater depends from model to model.</p>
<p>Most oil heaters weigh around 25 pounds, whereas most infrared heaters weigh only 10 pounds. However, you can find lighter (mini) oil heaters and bigger infrared heaters which weigh 25 pounds as well.</p>
<h2 id="2-size">2. Size<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-size">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-1">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-1">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Big, but compact (not unnecessarily big)</p>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Sometimes too big.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-1">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-1">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> From small to big - you can find all sizes.</p>
<p>You can get infrared heaters in absolutely every size. From very small desk heaters you can use in your office, to really big and powerful heaters that are able to heat whole apartments.</p>
<p>The size of an infrared heater is not limited. It’s simple for the manufacturers to change the size of the infrared heating element.</p>
<p>In contrast, oil heaters can not get arbitrarily large. Too big models would be too heavy to handle. That’s why you mostly find oil heaters in similar sizes. They are compact and size-efficient. Oil heaters appear big at first. But they need a good size to distribute the heat evenly.</p>
<p>Usually, oil heaters are one-size-fits-all. Of course, there are some exceptions. You can, for example, find mini oil heaters or oil heaters with very thin heating bodies. By using these you sacrifice heating capacity though.</p>
<h2 id="3-heating-speed">3. Heating Speed<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-heating-speed">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-2">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-2">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Slow heating speed.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-2">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-2">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Fast heating speed. Reaches full heat within a minute.</p>
<p>Heating speed is mainly determined by the technology that’s used in a heater.</p>
<p>The heating speed is one of the fundamental differences between an infrared vs oil heater. And it’s one of the key differences you need to decide which model suits you best.</p>
<p>Do you need a fast heater or a slow and steady model?</p>
<p>Infrared heaters are extremely fast. They are the racing cars among heaters.</p>
<p>It takes an infrared heater just a minute to get to full heat. As soon as you turn an infrared heater on, you can feel the heat coming out.</p>
<p>They are a great solution if you’re freezing and you want to warm up immediately.</p>
<p>Oil heaters need more time. They are the snails among heaters. It takes them several minutes to get warm. The reason is that the metal body contains lots of oil to distribute the heat.</p>
<p>Before any heat reaches you, the heater has to warm up the oil first. That’s what takes time.</p>
<p>Because of that, oil heaters are good for longer heating periods, for example, keeping a living room warm throughout the evening.</p>

<h2 id="4-efficiency">4. Efficiency<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-efficiency">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-3">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-3">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Efficient heating of large rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Not efficient outdoors.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-3">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-3">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Efficient heating in small rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Not efficient heating large rooms.</p>
<p>Both heaters, infrared and oil heaters are efficient in their own ways. You just have to know what you want to use them for. Each of them is best in certain applications.</p>
<p>Infrared heaters produce directional heat (radiation) that heats just space in front of the space heater. That’s why infrared heaters are 40% more efficient than other heaters.</p>
<p>It’s because you can focus the heat in one direction. For that reason, infrared heaters are good at heating single persons.</p>
<p>You can point the heater at them. But whole rooms are hard to heat using infrared because the infrared rays usually don’t cover the whole room.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a guide on the <a href="/where-to-place-an-infrared-heater/">best infrared heater placements</a> within a room to maximize efficiency (something you can&rsquo;t do with oil-filled radiators).</p>
<p>In contrast, oil heaters distribute the heat more evenly. They produce warm air that distributes everywhere in a room. Because of that, oil heaters are better at heating bigger rooms.</p>
<p>However, oil heaters can’t heat outdoors at all. The wind immediately blows the warm air away, whereas the directional heat of infrared heaters withstands the wind. You can’t blow away radiation.</p>
<h2 id="5-price">5. Price<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-price">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-4">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-4">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Price-effective.</p>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Few models in lower price categories.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-4">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-4">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> More heaters in lower price categories.</p>
<p>Oil heaters and infrared heaters both are available in very similar price ranges. You can find most models between $50 and $200.</p>
<p>However, in the lower price range, you can find more infrared heaters. I guess the reason is that they are easier to produce overseas and import than heavy oil heaters. That’s why there are a lot of cheap infrared heaters: They are easier to ship.</p>
<p>Still, you can find oil heaters for cheap and infrared heaters that are expensive. There are no real limitations for the price you pay.</p>
<p>However, remember that an oil heater is better in heating large spaces. This means that for the same price, you can heat more space. Meanwhile, infrared heaters are more efficient in the long run. The long-term cost to run an infrared heater is usually lower.</p>
<p><img alt="infrared space heaters electricity cost less than others in some occasions" loading="lazy" src="/img/infrared-space-heaters-electricity-cost.webp"></p>
<h2 id="6-safety">6. Safety<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-safety">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-5">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-5">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Very safe. Also safe to touch.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-5">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-5">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Very safe.</p>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Not safe to touch.</p>
<p>Oil heaters and infrared heaters both come with a vast amount of safety features. From safety certifications to overheat protection, automatic shut-off, tip-over protection, and everything you wish to feel safe.</p>
<p>However, there’s one small difference that makes oil heaters safer by a small margin.</p>
<p>Infrared heaters emit heat through a focused area where the heat comes out. This area is usually protected by a metal grid, so you can not put your hand inside. Even though the metal grid is a safety measure, it heats up as well and becomes hot to the touch. I tried it myself and burned my fingers.</p>
<p>In contrast, oil heaters distribute their heat over a large surface. This way the heat is spread evenly instead of being focused. That’s why oil heaters are usually safe to touch and don’t get burning hot.</p>
<h2 id="7-portability">7. Portability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#7-portability">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-6">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-6">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Rollers increase portability.</p>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Still rather hard to transport compared to other heaters.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-6">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-6">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> High portability, easy to transport.</p>
<p>When you want to move your space heater to another room, portability becomes important.</p>
<p>Because of the lower weight, infrared heaters win this point. They are easy to lift and light. Usually, they are already handy to carry or they have a built-in handle to carry them easily.</p>
<p>On the other hand, oil heaters also try to do the best they can. Oftentimes they come with rollers, so you can easily move them around. However, oil heaters become really hard to transport when you have to move them upstairs. The rollers are only useful as long as the heater stays on the same floor.</p>
<h2 id="8-heating-capacity">8. Heating Capacity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#8-heating-capacity">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-7">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-7">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Very high heating capacity. Stores and produces lots of heat.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-7">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-7">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Low heating capacity. The heat immediately disappears after turning it off.</p>
<p>Heating capacity is the amount of heat that the heater stores and emits over time. More heating capacity means more heat and more heating strength.</p>
<p>Infrared heaters have absolutely no heating capacity. Once you turn an infrared heater off, the heat vanishes immediately. It doesn’t store any heat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, oil heaters have a high heating capacity. Even after turning them off, the oil remains how and continues to deliver heat until it cools down. It’s similar to how a hot water bottle works.</p>
<p>That’s why oil heaters can heat more evenly and are better in delivering heat over longer periods of time.</p>
<h2 id="9-versatility">9. Versatility<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#9-versatility">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-8">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-8">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Low versatility. Only useful in closed rooms.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-8">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-8">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> High versatility. Useful in many locations.</p>
<p>Oil heaters are best for heating closed rooms. Especially indoor home heating is what they are made for. But they can also keep small wood workshops warm. The issue with oil heaters is that they attempt to heat the air of the room. That’s why they are not useful (compared to infrared heaters) in heating uninsulated rooms. You also can’t use them outdoors at all.</p>
<p>Infrared heaters are much more versatile. They can heat indoors, in garages, uninsulated rooms, attics and even outdoors. Basically, you can use them wherever you want. The reason is that infrared heat is such a special type of heat that keeps you warm even when the air around you is cold. It’s similar to how sun rays feel in wintertime.</p>
<h2 id="10-maintenance">10. Maintenance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#10-maintenance">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-9">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-9">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> No regular maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Hard to fix in case it breaks.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-9">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-9">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> No maintenance. Easier to fix.</p>
<p>As long as you’re not an electrician, you shouldn’t do any maintenance jobs on your heater. Still, this point is important in case your heater breaks.</p>
<p>It’s possible to let an electrician fix your heater. So here’s the maintenance difference between an infrared vs oil heater.</p>
<p>Infrared heaters are generally simpler types of heaters you can easily understand. They consist of a power conversion stage and a heating stage. It’s not a big deal for someone who likes electronics to locate the issue.</p>
<p>Oil heaters are a little more complex. They have a similar power conversion and heating stage. However, the heating element is <a href="https://www.newair.com/blogs/learn/oil-filled-heaters">embodied in the metal body</a> and is very hard to fix.</p>
<p>When an oil heater breaks, chances are, you better buy a new one.</p>
<p>Still, both heaters are maintenance-free and you don’t need to check them regularly.</p>
<h2 id="11-design">11. Design<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#11-design">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-10">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-10">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Oil heaters all look about the same. Good designs are rare.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-10">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-10">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> All designs you wish for.</p>
<p>Oil heaters look like typical heaters. And they all look about the same. They have a thermostat attached to a metal body. That’s it. There’s no fancy design and finding a good looking one is hard. Oil heaters are hard to fit in a stylish apartment. At least, you’ll have to spend time looking for a good looking model that suits your purposes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, infrared heaters are available in all sizes, shapes, and designs. From what I have seen, you can find models that fit every style you want. The design point goes to infrared heaters.</p>
<h2 id="12-comfort">12. Comfort<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#12-comfort">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-11">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-11">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Oil heaters produce even heat.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-11">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-11">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Dry heat that feels like sunlight.</p>
<p>When you use a space heater all day long, it’s important that the heat it produces feels good and you are comfortable with it.</p>
<p>My impression is that infrared heat feels like sunlight. Also, it’s very similar to the heat of a fireplace. It’s very focused heat and it feels like it dries your skin. You might now that dry-skin feeling when you’re sitting at a campfire. Here’s an article on <a href="/space-heaters-that-dont-dry-the-air/">3 Heaters that don’t dry the air</a>!</p>
<p>When I have my infrared heater next to me while I’m working, it heats only one side of my body, which I don’t really like.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, oil heaters produce heat that feels much better. The heat does not rely on radiation, but it warms the air, which feels more comfortable. Also, oil heaters heat a room evenly.</p>
<h2 id="13-storage">13. Storage<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#13-storage">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-12">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-12">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Storable, but hard to fit in a small storage room.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-12">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-12">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Easy to store.</p>
<p>During summertime, you don’t always want to keep your heater in your room. So you need to store it.</p>
<p>But which one fits better in a storage room? Infrared vs oil heater?</p>
<p>Both heaters are definitely easy to fit in a storage room. Usually, oil heaters are a little bigger and cumbersome which makes them a little harder to store in small rooms. Also, they are very heavy, so you can’t really put them on a shelve.</p>
<p>Infrared heaters are easy to store. They are smaller and lighter, so you can easily put them wherever you want. And you can take them out easily at any time.</p>
<h2 id="14-availability">14. Availability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#14-availability">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-13">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-13">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Available everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Hard to find in small local shops.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-13">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-13">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Available everywhere.</p>
<p>You can easily find both heater types online. There’s no difference in availability between an infrared vs oil heater.</p>
<p>However, in local shops, infrared heaters are more present - at least where I live. The reason is probably that they are cheaper, easier to sell and more portable. People would hate buying an oil heater off the shelve and carry it home.</p>
<p>You can find both heater types used online. So, you can get even better bargains.</p>
<h2 id="15-overnight-use">15. Overnight Use<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#15-overnight-use">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-14">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-14">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Safe to run overnight.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-14">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-14">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Emits light which disrupts sleep.</p>
<p>When you use a space heater overnight, what you’re looking for is even and long-lasting heat. Which already gives you a hint on which heater is the better choice.</p>
<p>Also, you want it to have sufficient power, even on lower settings and enough safety features.</p>
<p>Important note: Only use a heater overnight, when you’re at home.</p>
<p>Infrared heaters are not suitable for overnight heating. Even if they provide enough heat and come with all the safety features you need. The heating elements of an infrared heater glow red which definitely hinders your sleep.</p>
<p>In contrast, oil heaters don’t emit any light and are better suited for heating a room overnight. Check out this article for the <a href="/3-best-oil-heaters-you-can-leave-on-all-night/">3 Best Oil Heaters to run overnight</a>!</p>
<p>Both heaters, infrared and oil heaters are silent at night.</p>
<h2 id="16-noise">16. Noise<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#16-noise">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-15">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-15">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Very silent.</p>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Can occasionally make a clicking noise (during heat-up and cool-down).</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-15">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-15">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Silent.</p>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Makes clicking noise as well.</p>
<p>Both heaters are silent as long as you don’t buy special models with a built-in fan. Usually, you can check that in the product description.</p>
<p>When an infrared vs oil heater heats up or cools down, they both can sometimes make clicking noises because of the expanding and contracting surface material. Due to the heat, the material moves a little and makes a little noise when it releases tension. That’s normal and you cannot avoid it.</p>
<p>However, these clicking noises are very rare.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that a transformer hums (very) silently or that the infrared tubes hum.</p>
<p>Generally, both types of heaters are comparably silent and you can run them while doing concentrated work or while sleeping.</p>

<h4 id="oil-heater-16">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-16">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Child and pet safe.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-16">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-16">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Oftentimes hot to touch.</p>
<p>If you have children or pets at home, you want to make sure, that nobody gets injured. So, what’s the better child- and pet safe heater? Infrared or oil?</p>
<p>Because infrared heaters have an opening where all the heat comes out, they are usually hot to touch in that area. The opening is usually protected by a metal grid, so you can’t put your hand inside and touch the heating element directly. However, this metal grid gets hot too.</p>
<p>Oil heaters, on the other hand, have a big surface and the heating element is embodied in oil. So, there are no hot to touch spots. Oil heaters get hot, but not hot enough to be dangerous.</p>

<h4 id="oil-heater-17">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-17">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Not useful outdoors.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-17">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-17">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Can be used outdoors.</p>
<p>Which heater is best for your next outdoor garden party? Which one should you set up in your party tent next summer?</p>
<p>Because infrared radiation heats objects and not air, you can feel the heat even when you are outdoors. That’s why infrared is good for garden parties or garage heating. Also, the heat is directional, which is very handy at parties. Guests who feel cold can stand next to the heater. Others can spend their time elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Outdoor infrared heaters warm up specific areas and objects rather than the air, you don’t waste energy and save money on your utility bills” <a href="https://www.infraredheatersdirect.co.uk/news/Do-infrared-outdoor-heaters-work/">infraredheatersdirect.co.uk</a></p>
<p>Oil heaters are not effective to run outdoors, because they try to heat the air. Outdoors, the wind would blow away any heat. Oil heaters are a waste of energy when you run them outdoors.</p>
<h3 id="19-thermostat">19. Thermostat<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#19-thermostat">#</a></h3>
<h4 id="oil-heater-18">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-18">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Better thermostats.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-18">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-18">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Usually not as good as oil heaters.</p>
<p>Generally, temperature control is working fine with both space heaters. For most infrared vs oil heater, you can find the temperature controls in two different designs.</p>
<p>Either it’s a simple power switch where you can set the power you want (usually 750W or 1500W). Or it’s a more advanced thermostat where you can set the exact temperature you want.</p>
<p>From an engineer’s perspective, it’s easier to control the temperature of an oil heater because it heats the air that surrounds it. So, the thermostat measures the current temperature, then compares it to the one you set and makes automatic corrections.</p>
<p>With infrared heaters, that’s more difficult because the infrared rays are harder to measure.</p>
<p>That’s why most (but not all) infrared heaters come with simple power switches and oil heaters have a thermostat.</p>
<p>But you can find both types of controls for both heaters.</p>
<h2 id="20-stability">20. Stability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#20-stability">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="oil-heater-19">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-19">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Very stable. Built with solid and heavy materials.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-19">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-19">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Con:</strong> Usually rather fragile.</p>
<p>Oil heaters are more stable than infrared heaters because of their heavy metal body that encases the oil. It’s their design that makes them stable. Oil heaters have to withstand changes in pressure (because the oil heats up) and therefore they have to be reliable.</p>
<p>Infrared heaters are often cheaper and less stable. With a plastic surface and parts that are not as solid as they should be. But when you think about it, infrared heaters don’t really need to be stable at all. All they do is emit heat. They don’t carry a huge load of oil compared to oil heaters.</p>
<p>That’s why oil heaters are more stable than infrared heaters.</p>

<h4 id="oil-heater-20">Oil Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#oil-heater-20">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Very durable. Lasts up to decades.</p>
<h4 id="infrared-heater-20">Infrared Heater<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#infrared-heater-20">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Pro:</strong> Durable, but a little less than oil heaters.</p>
<p>Both heaters have no moving parts. So, they can’t wear down. This makes both heater types (infrared vs oil heater) very durable.</p>
<p>However, I always see tons of used oil heaters for sale online (on eBay or craigslist) that people found in their garages. They seem to last for decades.</p>
<p>Infrared heaters usually consist of less durable materials, which is why they don’t last as long as oil heaters.</p>
<p>Compared to other types of heaters (ceramic for example), both infrared and oil heaters are very durable.</p>
